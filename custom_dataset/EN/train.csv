ACT I :
SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES ' palace . :
ARCHIDAMUS :
If you shall chance , Camillo , to visit Bohemia , on :
the like occasion whereon my services are now on :
foot , you shall see , as I have said , great :
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia . :
CAMILLO :
I think , this coming summer , the King of Sicilia :
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him . :
ARCHIDAMUS :
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be :
justified in our loves ; for indeed-- :
CAMILLO :
Beseech you , -- :
ARCHIDAMUS :
Verily , I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge : :
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know :
not what to say . We will give you sleepy drinks , :
that your senses , unintelligent of our insufficience , :
may , though they cannot praise us , as little accuse :
us . :
CAMILLO :
You pay a great deal too dear for what 's given freely . :
ARCHIDAMUS :
Believe me , I speak as my understanding instructs me :
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance . :
CAMILLO :
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia . :
They were trained together in their childhoods ; and :
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection , :
which cannot choose but branch now . Since their :
more mature dignities and royal necessities made :
separation of their society , their encounters , :
though not personal , have been royally attorneyed :
with interchange of gifts , letters , loving :
embassies ; that they have seemed to be together , :
though absent , shook hands , as over a vast , and :
embraced , as it were , from the ends of opposed :
winds . The heavens continue their loves ! :
ARCHIDAMUS :
I think there is not in the world either malice or :
matter to alter it . You have an unspeakable :
comfort of your young prince Mamillius : it is a :
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came :
into my note . :
CAMILLO :
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him : it :
is a gallant child ; one that indeed physics the :
subject , makes old hearts fresh : they that went on :
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to :
see him a man . :
ARCHIDAMUS :
Would they else be content to die ? :
CAMILLO :
Yes ; if there were no other excuse why they should :
desire to live . :
ARCHIDAMUS :
If the king had no son , they would desire to live :
on crutches till he had one . :
SCENE II . A room of state in the same . :
POLIXENES :
Nine changes of the watery star hath been :
The shepherd 's note since we have left our throne :
Without a burthen : time as long again :
Would be find up , my brother , with our thanks ; :
And yet we should , for perpetuity , :
Go hence in debt : and therefore , like a cipher , :
Yet standing in rich place , I multiply :
With one ' We thank you ' many thousands moe :
That go before it . :
LEONTES :
Stay your thanks a while ; :
And pay them when you part . :
POLIXENES :
Sir , that 's to-morrow . :
I am question 'd by my fears , of what may chance :
Or breed upon our absence ; that may blow :
No sneaping winds at home , to make us say :
'This is put forth too truly : ' besides , I have stay 'd :
To tire your royalty . :
LEONTES :
We are tougher , brother , :
Than you can put us to 't . :
POLIXENES :
No longer stay . :
LEONTES :
One seven-night longer . :
POLIXENES :
Very sooth , to-morrow . :
LEONTES :
We 'll part the time between 's then ; and in that :
I 'll no gainsaying . :
POLIXENES :
Press me not , beseech you , so . :
","Camillo and Archidamus are discussing the long-standing friendship between Leontes and Polixenes, their respective kings. Polixenes has been staying at Leontes' court."
"So soon as yours could win me : so it should now , :
Were there necessity in your request , although :
'Twere needful I denied it . My affairs :
Do even drag me homeward : which to hinder :
Were in your love a whip to me ; my stay :
To you a charge and trouble : to save both , :
Farewell , our brother . :
LEONTES :
Tongue-tied , our queen ? :
speak you . :
HERMIONE :
I had thought , sir , to have held my peace until :
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay . You , sir , :
Charge him too coldly . Tell him , you are sure :
All in Bohemia 's well ; this satisfaction :
The by-gone day proclaim 'd : say this to him , :
He 's beat from his best ward . :
LEONTES :
Well said , Hermione . :
HERMIONE :
To tell , he longs to see his son , were strong : :
But let him say so then , and let him go ; :
But let him swear so , and he shall not stay , :
We 'll thwack him hence with distaffs . :
Yet of your royal presence I 'll adventure :
The borrow of a week . When at Bohemia :
You take my lord , I 'll give him my commission :
To let him there a month behind the gest :
Prefix 'd for 's parting : yet , good deed , Leontes , :
I love thee not a jar o ' the clock behind :
What lady-she her lord . You 'll stay ? :
POLIXENES :
No , madam . :
HERMIONE :
Nay , but you will ? :
POLIXENES :
I may not , verily . :
HERMIONE :
Verily ! :
You put me off with limber vows ; but I , :
Though you would seek to unsphere the :
stars with oaths , :
Should yet say ' Sir , no going . ' Verily , :
You shall not go : a lady 's ' Verily ' ' s :
As potent as a lord 's . Will you go yet ? :
Force me to keep you as a prisoner , :
Not like a guest ; so you shall pay your fees :
When you depart , and save your thanks . How say you ? :
My prisoner ? or my guest ? by your dread ' Verily , ' :
One of them you shall be . :
POLIXENES :
Your guest , then , madam : :
To be your prisoner should import offending ; :
Which is for me less easy to commit :
Than you to punish . :
HERMIONE :
Not your gaoler , then , :
But your kind hostess . Come , I 'll question you :
Of my lord 's tricks and yours when you were boys : :
You were pretty lordings then ? :
POLIXENES :
We were , fair queen , :
Two lads that thought there was no more behind :
But such a day to-morrow as to-day , :
And to be boy eternal . :
HERMIONE :
Was not my lord :
The verier wag o ' the two ? :
POLIXENES :
We were as twinn 'd lambs that did frisk i ' the sun , :
And bleat the one at the other : what we changed :
Was innocence for innocence ; we knew not :
The doctrine of ill-doing , nor dream 'd :
That any did . Had we pursued that life , :
And our weak spirits ne 'er been higher rear 'd :
With stronger blood , we should have answer 'd heaven :
Boldly ' not guilty ; ' the imposition clear 'd :
Hereditary ours . :
HERMIONE :
By this we gather :
You have tripp 'd since . :
POLIXENES :
O my most sacred lady ! :
Temptations have since then been born to 's ; for :
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl ; :
Your precious self had then not cross 'd the eyes :
Of my young play-fellow . :
HERMIONE :
Grace to boot ! :
Of this make no conclusion , lest you say :
Your queen and I are devils : yet go on ; :
",Polixenes is persuaded by Leontes' wife Hermione (who acts at Leontes' suggestion) to stay with him longer.
"If you first sinn 'd with us and that with us :
You did continue fault and that you slipp 'd not :
With any but with us . :
LEONTES :
Is he won yet ? :
HERMIONE :
He 'll stay my lord . :
LEONTES :
At my request he would not . :
Hermione , my dearest , thou never spokest :
To better purpose . :
HERMIONE :
Never ? :
LEONTES :
Never , but once . :
HERMIONE :
What ! have I twice said well ? when was 't before ? :
I prithee tell me ; cram 's with praise , and make 's :
As fat as tame things : one good deed dying tongueless :
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that . :
Our praises are our wages : you may ride 's :
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere :
With spur we beat an acre . But to the goal : :
My last good deed was to entreat his stay : :
What was my first ? it has an elder sister , :
Or I mistake you : O , would her name were Grace ! :
But once before I spoke to the purpose : when ? :
Nay , let me have 't ; I long . :
LEONTES :
Why , that was when :
Three crabbed months had sour 'd themselves to death , :
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand :
And clap thyself my love : then didst thou utter :
'I am yours for ever . ' :
HERMIONE :
'Tis grace indeed . :
Why , lo you now , I have spoke to the purpose twice : :
The one for ever earn 'd a royal husband ; :
The other for some while a friend . :
LEONTES :
[ Aside ] Too hot , too hot ! :
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods . :
I have tremor cordis on me : my heart dances ; :
But not for joy ; not joy . This entertainment :
May a free face put on , derive a liberty :
From heartiness , from bounty , fertile bosom , :
And well become the agent ; ' t may , I grant ; :
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers , :
As now they are , and making practised smiles , :
As in a looking-glass , and then to sigh , as ' twere :
The mort o ' the deer ; O , that is entertainment :
My bosom likes not , nor my brows ! Mamillius , :
Art thou my boy ? :
MAMILLIUS :
Ay , my good lord . :
LEONTES :
I ' fecks ! :
Why , that 's my bawcock . What , hast :
smutch 'd thy nose ? :
They say it is a copy out of mine . Come , captain , :
We must be neat ; not neat , but cleanly , captain : :
And yet the steer , the heifer and the calf :
Are all call 'd neat.--Still virginalling :
Upon his palm ! --How now , you wanton calf ! :
Art thou my calf ? :
MAMILLIUS :
Yes , if you will , my lord . :
LEONTES :
Thou want 'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have , :
To be full like me : yet they say we are :
Almost as like as eggs ; women say so , :
That will say anything but were they false :
As o 'er-dyed blacks , as wind , as waters , false :
As dice are to be wish 'd by one that fixes :
No bourn ' twixt his and mine , yet were it true :
To say this boy were like me . Come , sir page , :
Look on me with your welkin eye : sweet villain ! :
Most dear 'st ! my collop ! Can thy dam ? --may 't be ? -- :
Affection ! thy intention stabs the centre : :
Thou dost make possible things not so held , :
Communicatest with dreams ; --how can this be ? -- :
With what 's unreal thou coactive art , :
And fellow 'st nothing : then ' tis very credent :
Thou mayst co-join with something ; and thou dost , :
","Hermione succeeds, but Leontes then grows jealous of the affection shown to Polixenes by Hermione, his pregnant wife."
"And that to the infection of my brains :
And hardening of my brows . :
POLIXENES :
What means Sicilia ? :
HERMIONE :
He something seems unsettled . :
POLIXENES :
How , my lord ! :
What cheer ? how is 't with you , best brother ? :
HERMIONE :
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction :
Are you moved , my lord ? :
LEONTES :
No , in good earnest . :
How sometimes nature will betray its folly , :
Its tenderness , and make itself a pastime :
To harder bosoms ! Looking on the lines :
Of my boy 's face , methoughts I did recoil :
Twenty-three years , and saw myself unbreech 'd , :
In my green velvet coat , my dagger muzzled , :
Lest it should bite its master , and so prove , :
As ornaments oft do , too dangerous : :
How like , methought , I then was to this kernel , :
This squash , this gentleman . Mine honest friend , :
Will you take eggs for money ? :
MAMILLIUS :
No , my lord , I 'll fight . :
LEONTES :
You will ! why , happy man be 's dole ! My brother , :
Are you so fond of your young prince as we :
Do seem to be of ours ? :
POLIXENES :
If at home , sir , :
He 's all my exercise , my mirth , my matter , :
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy , :
My parasite , my soldier , statesman , all : :
He makes a July 's day short as December , :
And with his varying childness cures in me :
Thoughts that would thick my blood . :
LEONTES :
So stands this squire :
Officed with me : we two will walk , my lord , :
And leave you to your graver steps . Hermione , :
How thou lovest us , show in our brother 's welcome ; :
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap : :
Next to thyself and my young rover , he 's :
Apparent to my heart . :
HERMIONE :
If you would seek us , :
We are yours i ' the garden : shall 's attend you there ? :
LEONTES :
To your own bents dispose you : you 'll be found , :
Be you beneath the sky . :
Aside :
I am angling now , :
Though you perceive me not how I give line . :
Go to , go to ! :
How she holds up the neb , the bill to him ! :
And arms her with the boldness of a wife :
To her allowing husband ! :
Gone already ! :
Inch-thick , knee-deep , o 'er head and :
ears a fork 'd one ! :
Go , play , boy , play : thy mother plays , and I :
Play too , but so disgraced a part , whose issue :
Will hiss me to my grave : contempt and clamour :
Will be my knell . Go , play , boy , play . :
There have been , :
Or I am much deceived , cuckolds ere now ; :
And many a man there is , even at this present , :
Now while I speak this , holds his wife by the arm , :
That little thinks she has been sluiced in 's absence :
And his pond fish 'd by his next neighbour , by :
Sir Smile , his neighbour : nay , there 's comfort in 't :
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open 'd , :
As mine , against their will . Should all despair :
That have revolted wives , the tenth of mankind :
Would hang themselves . Physic for 't there is none ; :
It is a bawdy planet , that will strike :
Where ' tis predominant ; and ' tis powerful , think it , :
From east , west , north and south : be it concluded , :
No barricado for a belly ; know 't ; :
It will let in and out the enemy :
With bag and baggage : many thousand on 's :
Have the disease , and feel 't not . How now , boy ! :
MAMILLIUS :
",Leontes convinces himself they are having an affair.
"LEONTES :
Why that 's some comfort . What , Camillo there ? :
CAMILLO :
Ay , my good lord . :
LEONTES :
Go play , Mamillius ; thou 'rt an honest man . :
Exit MAMILLIUS :
Camillo , this great sir will yet stay longer . :
CAMILLO :
You had much ado to make his anchor hold : :
When you cast out , it still came home . :
LEONTES :
Didst note it ? :
CAMILLO :
He would not stay at your petitions : made :
His business more material . :
LEONTES :
Didst perceive it ? :
Aside :
They 're here with me already , whispering , rounding :
'Sicilia is a so-forth : ' ' tis far gone , :
When I shall gust it last . How came 't , Camillo , :
That he did stay ? :
CAMILLO :
At the good queen 's entreaty . :
LEONTES :
At the queen 's be 't : ' good ' should be pertinent :
But , so it is , it is not . Was this taken :
By any understanding pate but thine ? :
For thy conceit is soaking , will draw in :
More than the common blocks : not noted , is 't , :
But of the finer natures ? by some severals :
Of head-piece extraordinary ? lower messes :
Perchance are to this business purblind ? say . :
CAMILLO :
Business , my lord ! I think most understand :
Bohemia stays here longer . :
LEONTES :
Ha ! :
CAMILLO :
Stays here longer . :
LEONTES :
Ay , but why ? :
CAMILLO :
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties :
Of our most gracious mistress . :
LEONTES :
Satisfy ! :
The entreaties of your mistress ! satisfy ! :
Let that suffice . I have trusted thee , Camillo , :
With all the nearest things to my heart , as well :
My chamber-councils , wherein , priest-like , thou :
Hast cleansed my bosom , I from thee departed :
Thy penitent reform 'd : but we have been :
Deceived in thy integrity , deceived :
In that which seems so . :
CAMILLO :
Be it forbid , my lord ! :
LEONTES :
To bide upon 't , thou art not honest , or , :
If thou inclinest that way , thou art a coward , :
Which hoxes honesty behind , restraining :
From course required ; or else thou must be counted :
A servant grafted in my serious trust :
And therein negligent ; or else a fool :
That seest a game play 'd home , the rich stake drawn , :
And takest it all for jest . :
CAMILLO :
My gracious lord , :
I may be negligent , foolish and fearful ; :
In every one of these no man is free , :
But that his negligence , his folly , fear , :
Among the infinite doings of the world , :
Sometime puts forth . In your affairs , my lord , :
If ever I were wilful-negligent , :
It was my folly ; if industriously :
I play 'd the fool , it was my negligence , :
Not weighing well the end ; if ever fearful :
To do a thing , where I the issue doubted , :
Where of the execution did cry out :
Against the non-performance , ' twas a fear :
Which oft infects the wisest : these , my lord , :
Are such allow 'd infirmities that honesty :
Is never free of . But , beseech your grace , :
Be plainer with me ; let me know my trespass :
By its own visage : if I then deny it , :
'Tis none of mine . :
LEONTES :
Ha ' not you seen , Camillo , -- :
But that 's past doubt , you have , or your eye-glass :
Is thicker than a cuckold 's horn , --or heard , -- :
For to a vision so apparent rumour :
Cannot be mute , --or thought , --for cogitation :
Resides not in that man that does not think , -- :
My wife is slippery ? If thou wilt confess , :
Or else be impudently negative , :
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought , then say :
",Leontes’ jealousy grow that he asks Camillo to poison Polixenes.
"As rank as any flax-wench that puts to :
Before her troth-plight : say 't and justify 't . :
CAMILLO :
I would not be a stander-by to hear :
My sovereign mistress clouded so , without :
My present vengeance taken : ' shrew my heart , :
You never spoke what did become you less :
Than this ; which to reiterate were sin :
As deep as that , though true . :
LEONTES :
Is whispering nothing ? :
Is leaning cheek to cheek ? is meeting noses ? :
Kissing with inside lip ? stopping the career :
Of laughing with a sigh ? --a note infallible :
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot ? :
Skulking in corners ? wishing clocks more swift ? :
Hours , minutes ? noon , midnight ? and all eyes :
Blind with the pin and web but theirs , theirs only , :
That would unseen be wicked ? is this nothing ? :
Why , then the world and all that 's in 't is nothing ; :
The covering sky is nothing ; Bohemia nothing ; :
My wife is nothing ; nor nothing have these nothings , :
If this be nothing . :
CAMILLO :
Good my lord , be cured :
Of this diseased opinion , and betimes ; :
For ' tis most dangerous . :
LEONTES :
Say it be , ' tis true . :
CAMILLO :
No , no , my lord . :
LEONTES :
It is ; you lie , you lie : :
I say thou liest , Camillo , and I hate thee , :
Pronounce thee a gross lout , a mindless slave , :
Or else a hovering temporizer , that :
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil , :
Inclining to them both : were my wife 's liver :
Infected as her life , she would not live :
The running of one glass . :
CAMILLO :
Who does infect her ? :
LEONTES :
Why , he that wears her like a medal , hanging :
About his neck , Bohemia : who , if I :
Had servants true about me , that bare eyes :
To see alike mine honour as their profits , :
Their own particular thrifts , they would do that :
Which should undo more doing : ay , and thou , :
His cupbearer , --whom I from meaner form :
Have benched and reared to worship , who mayst see :
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven , :
How I am galled , --mightst bespice a cup , :
To give mine enemy a lasting wink ; :
Which draught to me were cordial . :
CAMILLO :
Sir , my lord , :
I could do this , and that with no rash potion , :
But with a lingering dram that should not work :
Maliciously like poison : but I cannot :
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress , :
So sovereignly being honourable . :
I have loved thee , -- :
LEONTES :
Make that thy question , and go rot ! :
Dost think I am so muddy , so unsettled , :
To appoint myself in this vexation , sully :
The purity and whiteness of my sheets , :
Which to preserve is sleep , which being spotted :
Is goads , thorns , nettles , tails of wasps , :
Give scandal to the blood o ' the prince my son , :
Who I do think is mine and love as mine , :
Without ripe moving to 't ? Would I do this ? :
Could man so blench ? :
CAMILLO :
I must believe you , sir : :
I do ; and will fetch off Bohemia for 't ; :
Provided that , when he 's removed , your highness :
Will take again your queen as yours at first , :
Even for your son 's sake ; and thereby for sealing :
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms :
Known and allied to yours . :
LEONTES :
Thou dost advise me :
Even so as I mine own course have set down : :
I 'll give no blemish to her honour , none . :
CAMILLO :
My lord , :
Go then ; and with a countenance as clear :
","Leontes expresses his jealousy and suspicion, believing that his wife is unfaithful to him. Camillo agrees and promises to help bring Bohemia to confirm Hermione's innocence. Leontes agrees but still plans to take action to protect his honor."
"And with your queen . I am his cupbearer : :
If from me he have wholesome beverage , :
Account me not your servant . :
LEONTES :
This is all : :
Do 't and thou hast the one half of my heart ; :
Do 't not , thou split 'st thine own . :
CAMILLO :
I 'll do 't , my lord . :
LEONTES :
I will seem friendly , as thou hast advised me . :
Exit :
CAMILLO :
O miserable lady ! But , for me , :
What case stand I in ? I must be the poisoner :
Of good Polixenes ; and my ground to do 't :
Is the obedience to a master , one :
Who in rebellion with himself will have :
All that are his so too . To do this deed , :
Promotion follows . If I could find example :
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings :
And flourish 'd after , I 'ld not do 't ; but since :
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one , :
Let villany itself forswear 't . I must :
Forsake the court : to do 't , or no , is certain :
To me a break-neck . Happy star , reign now ! :
Here comes Bohemia . :
Re-enter POLIXENES :
POLIXENES :
This is strange : methinks :
My favour here begins to warp . Not speak ? :
Good day , Camillo . :
CAMILLO :
Hail , most royal sir ! :
POLIXENES :
What is the news i ' the court ? :
CAMILLO :
None rare , my lord . :
POLIXENES :
The king hath on him such a countenance :
As he had lost some province and a region :
Loved as he loves himself : even now I met him :
With customary compliment ; when he , :
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling :
A lip of much contempt , speeds from me and :
So leaves me to consider what is breeding :
That changeth thus his manners . :
CAMILLO :
I dare not know , my lord . :
POLIXENES :
How ! dare not ! do not . Do you know , and dare not ? :
Be intelligent to me : ' tis thereabouts ; :
For , to yourself , what you do know , you must . :
And cannot say , you dare not . Good Camillo , :
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror :
Which shows me mine changed too ; for I must be :
A party in this alteration , finding :
Myself thus alter 'd with ' t . :
CAMILLO :
There is a sickness :
Which puts some of us in distemper , but :
I cannot name the disease ; and it is caught :
Of you that yet are well . :
POLIXENES :
How ! caught of me ! :
Make me not sighted like the basilisk : :
I have look 'd on thousands , who have sped the better :
By my regard , but kill 'd none so . Camillo , -- :
As you are certainly a gentleman , thereto :
Clerk-like experienced , which no less adorns :
Our gentry than our parents ' noble names , :
In whose success we are gentle , --I beseech you , :
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge :
Thereof to be inform 'd , imprison 't not :
In ignorant concealment . :
CAMILLO :
I may not answer . :
POLIXENES :
A sickness caught of me , and yet I well ! :
I must be answer 'd . Dost thou hear , Camillo , :
I conjure thee , by all the parts of man :
Which honour does acknowledge , whereof the least :
Is not this suit of mine , that thou declare :
What incidency thou dost guess of harm :
Is creeping toward me ; how far off , how near ; :
Which way to be prevented , if to be ; :
If not , how best to bear it . :
CAMILLO :
Sir , I will tell you ; :
Since I am charged in honour and by him :
That I think honourable : therefore mark my counsel , :
Which must be even as swiftly follow 'd as :
","Camillo, knowing Polixenes' innocence, informs him of Leontes' intentions"
"Cry lost , and so good night ! :
POLIXENES :
On , good Camillo . :
CAMILLO :
I am appointed him to murder you . :
POLIXENES :
By whom , Camillo ? :
CAMILLO :
By the king . :
POLIXENES :
For what ? :
CAMILLO :
He thinks , nay , with all confidence he swears , :
As he had seen 't or been an instrument :
To vice you to 't , that you have touch 'd his queen :
Forbiddenly . :
POLIXENES :
O , then my best blood turn :
To an infected jelly and my name :
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best ! :
Turn then my freshest reputation to :
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril :
Where I arrive , and my approach be shunn 'd , :
Nay , hated too , worse than the great 'st infection :
That e 'er was heard or read ! :
CAMILLO :
Swear his thought over :
By each particular star in heaven and :
By all their influences , you may as well :
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon :
As or by oath remove or counsel shake :
The fabric of his folly , whose foundation :
Is piled upon his faith and will continue :
The standing of his body . :
POLIXENES :
How should this grow ? :
CAMILLO :
I know not : but I am sure ' tis safer to :
Avoid what 's grown than question how ' tis born . :
If therefore you dare trust my honesty , :
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you :
Shall bear along impawn 'd , away to-night ! :
Your followers I will whisper to the business , :
And will by twos and threes at several posterns :
Clear them o ' the city . For myself , I 'll put :
My fortunes to your service , which are here :
By this discovery lost . Be not uncertain ; :
For , by the honour of my parents , I :
Have utter 'd truth : which if you seek to prove , :
I dare not stand by ; nor shall you be safer :
Than one condemn 'd by the king 's own mouth , thereon :
His execution sworn . :
POLIXENES :
I do believe thee : :
I saw his heart in ' s face . Give me thy hand : :
Be pilot to me and thy places shall :
Still neighbour mine . My ships are ready and :
My people did expect my hence departure :
Two days ago . This jealousy :
Is for a precious creature : as she 's rare , :
Must it be great , and as his person 's mighty , :
Must it be violent , and as he does conceive :
He is dishonour 'd by a man which ever :
Profess 'd to him , why , his revenges must :
In that be made more bitter . Fear o 'ershades me : :
Good expedition be my friend , and comfort :
The gracious queen , part of his theme , but nothing :
Of his ill-ta 'en suspicion ! Come , Camillo ; :
I will respect thee as a father if :
Thou bear 'st my life off hence : let us avoid . :
CAMILLO :
It is in mine authority to command :
The keys of all the posterns : please your highness :
To take the urgent hour . Come , sir , away . :
ACT II :
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES ' palace . :
HERMIONE :
Take the boy to you : he so troubles me , :
'Tis past enduring . :
First Lady :
Come , my gracious lord , :
Shall I be your playfellow ? :
MAMILLIUS :
No , I 'll none of you . :
First Lady :
Why , my sweet lord ? :
MAMILLIUS :
You 'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if :
I were a baby still . I love you better . :
Second Lady :
And why so , my lord ? :
MAMILLIUS :
Not for because :
Your brows are blacker ; yet black brows , they say , :
Become some women best , so that there be not :
","Polixenes flees Sicilia for Bohemia, taking Camillo with him."
"Or a half-moon made with a pen . :
Second Lady :
Who taught you this ? :
MAMILLIUS :
I learnt it out of women 's faces . Pray now :
What colour are your eyebrows ? :
First Lady :
Blue , my lord . :
MAMILLIUS :
Nay , that 's a mock : I have seen a lady 's nose :
That has been blue , but not her eyebrows . :
First Lady :
Hark ye ; :
The queen your mother rounds apace : we shall :
Present our services to a fine new prince :
One of these days ; and then you 'ld wanton with us , :
If we would have you . :
Second Lady :
She is spread of late :
Into a goodly bulk : good time encounter her ! :
HERMIONE :
What wisdom stirs amongst you ? Come , sir , now :
I am for you again : pray you , sit by us , :
And tell ' s a tale . :
MAMILLIUS :
Merry or sad shall 't be ? :
HERMIONE :
As merry as you will . :
MAMILLIUS :
A sad tale 's best for winter : I have one :
Of sprites and goblins . :
HERMIONE :
Let 's have that , good sir . :
Come on , sit down : come on , and do your best :
To fright me with your sprites ; you 're powerful at it . :
MAMILLIUS :
There was a man-- :
HERMIONE :
Nay , come , sit down ; then on . :
MAMILLIUS :
Dwelt by a churchyard : I will tell it softly ; :
Yond crickets shall not hear it . :
HERMIONE :
Come on , then , :
And give 't me in mine ear . :
LEONTES :
Was he met there ? his train ? Camillo with him ? :
First Lord :
Behind the tuft of pines I met them ; never :
Saw I men scour so on their way : I eyed them :
Even to their ships . :
LEONTES :
How blest am I :
In my just censure , in my true opinion ! :
Alack , for lesser knowledge ! how accursed :
In being so blest ! There may be in the cup :
A spider steep 'd , and one may drink , depart , :
And yet partake no venom , for his knowledge :
Is not infected : but if one present :
The abhorr 'd ingredient to his eye , make known :
How he hath drunk , he cracks his gorge , his sides , :
With violent hefts . I have drunk , :
and seen the spider . :
Camillo was his help in this , his pander : :
There is a plot against my life , my crown ; :
All 's true that is mistrusted : that false villain :
Whom I employ 'd was pre-employ 'd by him : :
He has discover 'd my design , and I :
Remain a pinch 'd thing ; yea , a very trick :
For them to play at will . How came the posterns :
So easily open ? :
First Lord :
By his great authority ; :
Which often hath no less prevail 'd than so :
On your command . :
LEONTES :
I know 't too well . :
Give me the boy : I am glad you did not nurse him : :
Though he does bear some signs of me , yet you :
Have too much blood in him . :
HERMIONE :
What is this ? sport ? :
LEONTES :
Bear the boy hence ; he shall not come about her ; :
Away with him ! and let her sport herself :
With that she 's big with ; for ' tis Polixenes :
Has made thee swell thus . :
HERMIONE :
But I 'ld say he had not , :
And I 'll be sworn you would believe my saying , :
Howe 'er you lean to the nayward . :
LEONTES :
You , my lords , :
Look on her , mark her well ; be but about :
To say ' she is a goodly lady , ' and :
The justice of your bearts will thereto add :
'Tis pity she 's not honest , honourable : ' :
",Leontes publicly accuses the pregnant Hermione.
"Which on my faith deserves high speech , and straight :
The shrug , the hum or ha , these petty brands :
That calumny doth use--O , I am out-- :
That mercy does , for calumny will sear :
Virtue itself : these shrugs , these hums and ha 's , :
When you have said ' she 's goodly , ' come between :
Ere you can say ' she 's honest : ' but be ' t known , :
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be , :
She 's an adulteress . :
HERMIONE :
Should a villain say so , :
The most replenish 'd villain in the world , :
He were as much more villain : you , my lord , :
Do but mistake . :
LEONTES :
You have mistook , my lady , :
Polixenes for Leontes : O thou thing ! :
Which I 'll not call a creature of thy place , :
Lest barbarism , making me the precedent , :
Should a like language use to all degrees :
And mannerly distinguishment leave out :
Betwixt the prince and beggar : I have said :
She 's an adulteress ; I have said with whom : :
More , she 's a traitor and Camillo is :
A federary with her , and one that knows :
What she should shame to know herself :
But with her most vile principal , that she 's :
A bed-swerver , even as bad as those :
That vulgars give bold 'st titles , ay , and privy :
To this their late escape . :
HERMIONE :
No , by my life . :
Privy to none of this . How will this grieve you , :
When you shall come to clearer knowledge , that :
You thus have publish 'd me ! Gentle my lord , :
You scarce can right me throughly then to say :
You did mistake . :
LEONTES :
No ; if I mistake :
In those foundations which I build upon , :
The centre is not big enough to bear :
A school-boy 's top . Away with her ! to prison ! :
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty :
But that he speaks . :
HERMIONE :
There 's some ill planet reigns : :
I must be patient till the heavens look :
With an aspect more favourable . Good my lords , :
I am not prone to weeping , as our sex :
Commonly are ; the want of which vain dew :
Perchance shall dry your pities : but I have :
That honourable grief lodged here which burns :
Worse than tears drown : beseech you all , my lords , :
With thoughts so qualified as your charities :
Shall best instruct you , measure me ; and so :
The king 's will be perform 'd ! :
LEONTES :
Shall I be heard ? :
HERMIONE :
Who is 't that goes with me ? Beseech your highness , :
My women may be with me ; for you see :
My plight requires it . Do not weep , good fools ; :
There is no cause : when you shall know your mistress :
Has deserved prison , then abound in tears :
As I come out : this action I now go on :
Is for my better grace . Adieu , my lord : :
I never wish 'd to see you sorry ; now :
I trust I shall . My women , come ; you have leave . :
LEONTES :
Go , do our bidding ; hence ! :
Exit HERMIONE , guarded ; with Ladies :
First Lord :
Beseech your highness , call the queen again . :
ANTIGONUS :
Be certain what you do , sir , lest your justice :
Prove violence ; in the which three great ones suffer , :
Yourself , your queen , your son . :
First Lord :
For her , my lord , :
I dare my life lay down and will do 't , sir , :
Please you to accept it , that the queen is spotless :
I ' the eyes of heaven and to you ; I mean , :
In this which you accuse her . :
ANTIGONUS :
If it prove :
","Hermione responds to the accusations made against her.  Hermione denies these accusations and expresses her innocence. Leontes, however, remains convinced of her guilt, accusing her of being a bed-swerver and a traitor, and orders her to be taken to prison."
"I lodge my wife ; I 'll go in couples with her ; :
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her ; :
For every inch of woman in the world , :
Ay , every dram of woman 's flesh is false , If she be . :
LEONTES :
Hold your peaces . :
First Lord :
Good my lord , -- :
ANTIGONUS :
It is for you we speak , not for ourselves : :
You are abused and by some putter-on :
That will be damn 'd for 't ; would I knew the villain , :
I would land-damn him . Be she honour-flaw 'd , :
I have three daughters ; the eldest is eleven :
The second and the third , nine , and some five ; :
If this prove true , they 'll pay for 't : :
by mine honour , :
I 'll geld ' em all ; fourteen they shall not see , :
To bring false generations : they are co-heirs ; :
And I had rather glib myself than they :
Should not produce fair issue . :
LEONTES :
Cease ; no more . :
You smell this business with a sense as cold :
As is a dead man 's nose : but I do see 't and feel 't :
As you feel doing thus ; and see withal :
The instruments that feel . :
ANTIGONUS :
If it be so , :
We need no grave to bury honesty : :
There 's not a grain of it the face to sweeten :
Of the whole dungy earth . :
LEONTES :
What ! lack I credit ? :
First Lord :
I had rather you did lack than I , my lord , :
Upon this ground ; and more it would content me :
To have her honour true than your suspicion , :
Be blamed for 't how you might . :
LEONTES :
Why , what need we :
Commune with you of this , but rather follow :
Our forceful instigation ? Our prerogative :
Calls not your counsels , but our natural goodness :
Imparts this ; which if you , or stupefied :
Or seeming so in skill , cannot or will not :
Relish a truth like us , inform yourselves :
We need no more of your advice : the matter , :
The loss , the gain , the ordering on 't , is all :
Properly ours . :
ANTIGONUS :
And I wish , my liege , :
You had only in your silent judgment tried it , :
Without more overture . :
LEONTES :
How could that be ? :
Either thou art most ignorant by age , :
Or thou wert born a fool . Camillo 's flight , :
Added to their familiarity , :
Which was as gross as ever touch 'd conjecture , :
That lack 'd sight only , nought for approbation :
But only seeing , all other circumstances :
Made up to the deed , doth push on this proceeding : :
Yet , for a greater confirmation , :
For in an act of this importance ' twere :
Most piteous to be wild , I have dispatch 'd in post :
To sacred Delphos , to Apollo 's temple , :
Cleomenes and Dion , whom you know :
Of stuff 'd sufficiency : now from the oracle :
They will bring all ; whose spiritual counsel had , :
Shall stop or spur me . Have I done well ? :
First Lord :
Well done , my lord . :
LEONTES :
Though I am satisfied and need no more :
Than what I know , yet shall the oracle :
Give rest to the minds of others , such as he :
Whose ignorant credulity will not :
Come up to the truth . So have we thought it good :
From our free person she should be confined , :
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence :
Be left her to perform . Come , follow us ; :
We are to speak in public ; for this business :
Will raise us all . :
ANTIGONUS :
[ Aside ] :
To laughter , as I take it , :
If the good truth were known . :
SCENE II . A prison . :
PAULINA :
",Lenotes sends Cleomenes and Dion to the Oracle to have his course of action confirmed.
"let him have knowledge who I am . :
Exit Gentleman :
Good lady , :
No court in Europe is too good for thee ; :
What dost thou then in prison ? :
Re-enter Gentleman , with the Gaoler :
Now , good sir , :
You know me , do you not ? :
Gaoler :
For a worthy lady :
And one whom much I honour . :
PAULINA :
Pray you then , :
Conduct me to the queen . :
Gaoler :
I may not , madam : :
To the contrary I have express commandment . :
PAULINA :
Here 's ado , :
To lock up honesty and honour from :
The access of gentle visitors ! :
Is 't lawful , pray you , :
To see her women ? any of them ? Emilia ? :
Gaoler :
So please you , madam , :
To put apart these your attendants , I :
Shall bring Emilia forth . :
PAULINA :
I pray now , call her . :
Withdraw yourselves . :
Gaoler :
And , madam , :
I must be present at your conference . :
PAULINA :
Well , be 't so , prithee . :
Exit Gaoler :
Here 's such ado to make no stain a stain :
As passes colouring . :
Re-enter Gaoler , with EMILIA :
Dear gentlewoman , :
How fares our gracious lady ? :
EMILIA :
As well as one so great and so forlorn :
May hold together : on her frights and griefs , :
Which never tender lady hath born greater , :
She is something before her time deliver 'd . :
PAULINA :
A boy ? :
EMILIA :
A daughter , and a goodly babe , :
Lusty and like to live : the queen receives :
Much comfort in 't ; says ' My poor prisoner , :
I am innocent as you . ' :
PAULINA :
I dare be sworn :
These dangerous unsafe lunes i ' the king , :
beshrew them ! :
He must be told on 't , and he shall : the office :
Becomes a woman best ; I 'll take 't upon me : :
If I prove honey-mouth 'd let my tongue blister :
And never to my red-look 'd anger be :
The trumpet any more . Pray you , Emilia , :
Commend my best obedience to the queen : :
If she dares trust me with her little babe , :
I 'll show 't the king and undertake to be :
Her advocate to the loud 'st . We do not know :
How he may soften at the sight o ' the child : :
The silence often of pure innocence :
Persuades when speaking fails . :
EMILIA :
Most worthy madam , :
Your honour and your goodness is so evident :
That your free undertaking cannot miss :
A thriving issue : there is no lady living :
So meet for this great errand . Please your ladyship :
To visit the next room , I 'll presently :
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer ; :
Who but to-day hammer 'd of this design , :
But durst not tempt a minister of honour , :
Lest she should be denied . :
PAULINA :
Tell her , Emilia . :
I 'll use that tongue I have : if wit flow from 't :
As boldness from my bosom , let ' t not be doubted :
I shall do good . :
EMILIA :
Now be you blest for it ! :
I 'll to the queen : please you , :
come something nearer . :
Gaoler :
Madam , if 't please the queen to send the babe , :
I know not what I shall incur to pass it , :
Having no warrant . :
PAULINA :
You need not fear it , sir : :
This child was prisoner to the womb and is :
By law and process of great nature thence :
Freed and enfranchised , not a party to :
The anger of the king nor guilty of , :
If any be , the trespass of the queen . :
Gaoler :
I do believe it . :
PAULINA :
Do not you fear : upon mine honour , :
I will stand betwixt you and danger . :
","While imprisoned, Hermione gives birth to a daughter."
"LEONTES :
Nor night nor day no rest : it is but weakness :
To bear the matter thus ; mere weakness . If :
The cause were not in being , --part o ' the cause , :
She the adulteress ; for the harlot king :
Is quite beyond mine arm , out of the blank :
And level of my brain , plot-proof ; but she :
I can hook to me : say that she were gone , :
Given to the fire , a moiety of my rest :
Might come to me again . Who 's there ? :
First Servant :
My lord ? :
LEONTES :
How does the boy ? :
First Servant :
He took good rest to-night ; :
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged . :
LEONTES :
To see his nobleness ! :
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother , :
He straight declined , droop 'd , took it deeply , :
Fasten 'd and fix 'd the shame on 't in himself , :
Threw off his spirit , his appetite , his sleep , :
And downright languish 'd . Leave me solely : go , :
See how he fares . :

Fie , fie ! no thought of him : :
The thought of my revenges that way :
Recoil upon me : in himself too mighty , :
And in his parties , his alliance ; let him be :
Until a time may serve : for present vengeance , :

Shall she within my power . :
First Lord :
You must not enter . :
PAULINA :
Nay , rather , good my lords , be second to me : :
Fear you his tyrannous passion more , alas , :
Than the queen 's life ? a gracious innocent soul , :
More free than he is jealous . :
ANTIGONUS :
That 's enough . :
Second Servant :
Madam , he hath not slept tonight ; commanded :
None should come at him . :
PAULINA :
Not so hot , good sir : :
I come to bring him sleep . ' Tis such as you , :
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh :
At each his needless heavings , such as you :
Nourish the cause of his awaking : I :
Do come with words as medicinal as true , :
Honest as either , to purge him of that humour :
That presses him from sleep . :
LEONTES :
What noise there , ho ? :
PAULINA :
No noise , my lord ; but needful conference :
About some gossips for your highness . :
LEONTES :
How ! :
Away with that audacious lady ! Antigonus , :
I charged thee that she should not come about me : :
I knew she would . :
ANTIGONUS :
I told her so , my lord , :
On your displeasure 's peril and on mine , :
She should not visit you . :
LEONTES :
What , canst not rule her ? :
PAULINA :
From all dishonesty he can : in this , :
Unless he take the course that you have done , :
Commit me for committing honour , trust it , :
He shall not rule me . :
ANTIGONUS :
La you now , you hear : :
When she will take the rein I let her run ; :
But she 'll not stumble . :
PAULINA :
Good my liege , I come ; :
And , I beseech you , hear me , who profess :
Myself your loyal servant , your physician , :
Your most obedient counsellor , yet that dare :
Less appear so in comforting your evils , :
Than such as most seem yours : I say , I come :
From your good queen . :
LEONTES :
Good queen ! :
PAULINA :
Good queen , my lord , :
Good queen ; I say good queen ; :
And would by combat make her good , so were I :
A man , the worst about you . :

LEONTES :
Out ! :
A mankind witch ! Hence with her , out o ' door : :
A most intelligencing bawd ! :

Not so : :
I am as ignorant in that as you :
In so entitling me , and no less honest :
Than you are mad ; which is enough , I 'll warrant , :
As this world goes , to pass for honest . :

He cannot be compell 'd to 't--once remove :
The root of his opinion , which is rotten :
As ever oak or stone was sound . :
LEONTES :
A callat :
Of boundless tongue , who late hath beat her husband :
And now baits me ! This brat is none of mine ; :
It is the issue of Polixenes : :
Hence with it , and together with the dam :
Commit them to the fire ! :
PAULINA :
It is yours ; :
And , might we lay the old proverb to your charge , :
So like you , ' tis the worse . Behold , my lords , :
Although the print be little , the whole matter :
And copy of the father , eye , nose , lip , :
The trick of 's frown , his forehead , nay , the valley , :
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek , :
His smiles , :
The very mould and frame of hand , nail , finger : :
And thou , good goddess Nature , which hast made it :
So like to him that got it , if thou hast :
The ordering of the mind too , ' mongst all colours :
No yellow in 't , lest she suspect , as he does , :
Her children not her husband 's ! :

Not she which burns in 't . I 'll not call you tyrant ; :
But this most cruel usage of your queen , :
Not able to produce more accusation :
Than your own weak-hinged fancy , something savours :
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you , :
Yea , scandalous to the world . :
LEONTES :
On your allegiance , :
Out of the chamber with her ! Were I a tyrant , :
Where were her life ? she durst not call me so , :
","Paulina defends Hermione's honor and insists that the child is Leontes' daughter. Leontes remains stubborn and orders the baby and Hermione to be taken away, even threatening to have them burned."

I pray you , do not push me ; I 'll be gone . :
Look to your babe , my lord ; ' tis yours : :
Jove send her :

You , that are thus so tender o 'er his follies , :
Will never do him good , not one of you . :
So , so : farewell ; we are gone . :

And see it instantly consumed with fire ; :
Even thou and none but thou . Take it up straight : :
Within this hour bring me word ' tis done , :
And by good testimony , or I 'll seize thy life , :
With what thou else call 'st thine . If thou refuse :
And wilt encounter with my wrath , say so ; :
The bastard brains with these my proper hands :
Shall I dash out . Go , take it to the fire ; :

Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel :
And call me father ? better burn it now :
Than curse it then . But be it ; let it live . :
It shall not neither . You , sir , come you hither ; :
You that have been so tenderly officious :
With Lady Margery , your midwife there , :
To save this bastard 's life , --for ' tis a bastard , :
So sure as this beard 's grey , :
--what will you adventure :
To save this brat 's life ? :

Any thing , my lord , :

It shall be possible . Swear by this sword :
Thou wilt perform my bidding . :
ANTIGONUS :
I will , my lord . :
LEONTES :
Mark and perform it , see 'st thou ! for the fail :
Of any point in 't shall not only be :
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife , :
Whom for this time we pardon . We enjoin thee , :
As thou art liege-man to us , that thou carry :
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it :
To some remote and desert place quite out :
Of our dominions , and that there thou leave it , :
Without more mercy , to its own protection :
And favour of the climate . As by strange fortune :
It came to us , I do in justice charge thee , :
On thy soul 's peril and thy body 's torture , :
That thou commend it strangely to some place :
Where chance may nurse or end it . Take it up . :
ANTIGONUS :
I swear to do this , though a present death :
Had been more merciful . Come on , poor babe : :
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens :
To be thy nurses ! Wolves and bears , they say :
Casting their savageness aside have done :
Like offices of pity . Sir , be prosperous :

So please you , sir , their speed :
Hath been beyond account . :
LEONTES :
Twenty-three days :
They have been absent : ' tis good speed ; foretells :
The great Apollo suddenly will have :
The truth of this appear . Prepare you , lords ; :
Summon a session , that we may arraign :
Our most disloyal lady , for , as she hath :
Been publicly accused , so shall she have :
A just and open trial . While she lives :

And think upon my bidding . :
ACT III :
SCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia . :
CLEOMENES :
The climate 's delicate , the air most sweet , :
Fertile the isle , the temple much surpassing :
The common praise it bears . :
DION :
I shall report , :
For most it caught me , the celestial habits , :
Methinks I so should term them , and the reverence :
Of the grave wearers . O , the sacrifice ! :
How ceremonious , solemn and unearthly :
It was i ' the offering ! :
CLEOMENES :
But of all , the burst :
And the ear-deafening voice o ' the oracle , :
Kin to Jove 's thunder , so surprised my sense . :
That I was nothing . :
DION :
If the event o ' the journey :
Prove as successful to the queen , --O be 't so ! -- :
As it hath been to us rare , pleasant , speedy , :
The time is worth the use on 't . :
CLEOMENES :
Great Apollo :
Turn all to the best ! These proclamations , :
So forcing faults upon Hermione , :
I little like . :
DION :
The violent carriage of it :
Will clear or end the business : when the oracle , :
Thus by Apollo 's great divine seal 'd up , :
Shall the contents discover , something rare :
Even then will rush to knowledge . Go : fresh horses ! :
And gracious be the issue ! :
SCENE II . A court of Justice . :
LEONTES :
This sessions , to our great grief we pronounce , :
Even pushes ' gainst our heart : the party tried :
The daughter of a king , our wife , and one :
Of us too much beloved . Let us be clear 'd :
Of being tyrannous , since we so openly :
Proceed in justice , which shall have due course , :
Even to the guilt or the purgation . :
Produce the prisoner . :
Officer :
It is his highness ' pleasure that the queen :
Appear in person here in court . Silence ! :
LEONTES :
Read the indictment . :
Officer :
[ Reads ] Hermione , queen to the worthy :
Leontes , king of Sicilia , thou art here accused and :
arraigned of high treason , in committing adultery :
with Polixenes , king of Bohemia , and conspiring :
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign :
lord the king , thy royal husband : the pretence :
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open , :
thou , Hermione , contrary to the faith and allegiance :
of a true subject , didst counsel and aid them , for :
their better safety , to fly away by night . :
HERMIONE :
Since what I am to say must be but that :
Which contradicts my accusation and :
The testimony on my part no other :
But what comes from myself , it shall scarce boot me :
To say ' not guilty : ' mine integrity :
Being counted falsehood , shall , as I express it , :
Be so received . But thus : if powers divine :
","Hermione, is accused of committing high treason, including adultery with Polixenes and conspiring to harm King Leontes."
"I doubt not then but innocence shall make :
False accusation blush and tyranny :
Tremble at patience . You , my lord , best know , :
Who least will seem to do so , my past life :
Hath been as continent , as chaste , as true , :
As I am now unhappy ; which is more :
Than history can pattern , though devised :
And play 'd to take spectators . For behold me :
A fellow of the royal bed , which owe :
A moiety of the throne a great king 's daughter , :
The mother to a hopeful prince , here standing :
To prate and talk for life and honour ' fore :
Who please to come and hear . For life , I prize it :
As I weigh grief , which I would spare : for honour , :
'Tis a derivative from me to mine , :
And only that I stand for . I appeal :
To your own conscience , sir , before Polixenes :
Came to your court , how I was in your grace , :
How merited to be so ; since he came , :
With what encounter so uncurrent I :
Have strain 'd to appear thus : if one jot beyond :
The bound of honour , or in act or will :
That way inclining , harden 'd be the hearts :
Of all that hear me , and my near 'st of kin :
Cry fie upon my grave ! :
LEONTES :
I ne 'er heard yet :
That any of these bolder vices wanted :
Less impudence to gainsay what they did :
Than to perform it first . :
HERMIONE :
That 's true enough ; :
Through ' tis a saying , sir , not due to me . :
LEONTES :
You will not own it . :
HERMIONE :
More than mistress of :
Which comes to me in name of fault , I must not :
At all acknowledge . For Polixenes , :
With whom I am accused , I do confess :
I loved him as in honour he required , :
With such a kind of love as might become :
A lady like me , with a love even such , :
So and no other , as yourself commanded : :
Which not to have done I think had been in me :
Both disobedience and ingratitude :
To you and toward your friend , whose love had spoke , :
Even since it could speak , from an infant , freely :
That it was yours . Now , for conspiracy , :
I know not how it tastes ; though it be dish 'd :
For me to try how : all I know of it :
Is that Camillo was an honest man ; :
And why he left your court , the gods themselves , :
Wotting no more than I , are ignorant . :
LEONTES :
You knew of his departure , as you know :
What you have underta 'en to do in 's absence . :
HERMIONE :
Sir , :
You speak a language that I understand not : :
My life stands in the level of your dreams , :
Which I 'll lay down . :
LEONTES :
Your actions are my dreams ; :
You had a bastard by Polixenes , :
And I but dream 'd it . As you were past all shame , -- :
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth : :
Which to deny concerns more than avails ; for as :
Thy brat hath been cast out , like to itself , :
No father owning it , --which is , indeed , :
More criminal in thee than it , --so thou :
Shalt feel our justice , in whose easiest passage :
Look for no less than death . :
HERMIONE :
Sir , spare your threats : :
The bug which you would fright me with I seek . :
To me can life be no commodity : :
The crown and comfort of my life , your favour , :
I do give lost ; for I do feel it gone , :
But know not how it went . My second joy :
And first-fruits of my body , from his presence :
I am barr 'd , like one infectious . My third comfort :
",Hermione defends her innocence and addresses Leontes' accusations. Leontes continues to accuse her of infidelity and having a child with Polixenes.
"The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth , :
Haled out to murder : myself on every post :
Proclaimed a strumpet : with immodest hatred :
The child-bed privilege denied , which ' longs :
To women of all fashion ; lastly , hurried :
Here to this place , i ' the open air , before :
I have got strength of limit . Now , my liege , :
Tell me what blessings I have here alive , :
That I should fear to die ? Therefore proceed . :
But yet hear this : mistake me not ; no life , :
I prize it not a straw , but for mine honour , :
Which I would free , if I shall be condemn 'd :
Upon surmises , all proofs sleeping else :
But what your jealousies awake , I tell you :
'Tis rigor and not law . Your honours all , :
I do refer me to the oracle : :
Apollo be my judge ! :
First Lord :
This your request :
Is altogether just : therefore bring forth , :
And in Apollos name , his oracle . :
HERMIONE :
The Emperor of Russia was my father : :
O that he were alive , and here beholding :
His daughter 's trial ! that he did but see :
The flatness of my misery , yet with eyes :
Of pity , not revenge ! :
Re-enter Officers , with CLEOMENES and DION :
Officer :
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice , :
That you , Cleomenes and Dion , have :
Been both at Delphos , and from thence have brought :
The seal 'd-up oracle , by the hand deliver 'd :
Of great Apollo 's priest ; and that , since then , :
You have not dared to break the holy seal :
Nor read the secrets in 't . :
CLEOMENES DION :
All this we swear . :
LEONTES :
Break up the seals and read . :
Officer :
[ Reads ] Hermione is chaste ; :
Polixenes blameless ; Camillo a true subject ; Leontes :
a jealous tyrant ; his innocent babe truly begotten ; :
and the king shall live without an heir , if that :
which is lost be not found . :
Lords :
Now blessed be the great Apollo ! :
HERMIONE :
Praised ! :
LEONTES :
Hast thou read truth ? :
Officer :
Ay , my lord ; even so :
As it is here set down . :
LEONTES :
There is no truth at all i ' the oracle : :
The sessions shall proceed : this is mere falsehood . :
Servant :
My lord the king , the king ! :
LEONTES :
What is the business ? :
Servant :
O sir , I shall be hated to report it ! :
The prince your son , with mere conceit and fear :
Of the queen 's speed , is gone . :
LEONTES :
How ! gone ! :
Servant :
Is dead . :
LEONTES :
Apollo 's angry ; and the heavens themselves :
Do strike at my injustice . :
HERMIONE swoons :
How now there ! :
PAULINA :
This news is mortal to the queen : look down :
And see what death is doing . :
LEONTES :
Take her hence : :
Her heart is but o 'ercharged ; she will recover : :
I have too much believed mine own suspicion : :
Beseech you , tenderly apply to her :
Some remedies for life . :
Apollo , pardon :
My great profaneness ' gainst thine oracle ! :
I 'll reconcile me to Polixenes , :
New woo my queen , recall the good Camillo , :
Whom I proclaim a man of truth , of mercy ; :
For , being transported by my jealousies :
To bloody thoughts and to revenge , I chose :
Camillo for the minister to poison :
My friend Polixenes : which had been done , :
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied :
My swift command , though I with death and with :
Reward did threaten and encourage him , :
Not doing ' t and being done : he , most humane :
And fill 'd with honour , to my kingly guest :
Unclasp 'd my practise , quit his fortunes here , :
","Cleomenes and Dion bring the judgement from the Oracle, which proclaims Hermione, Polixenes, and Camillo all innocent, and predicts that Leontes will have no heir if the banished baby is not found.Leontes rejects the Oracle, only to learn that his son has died. Hermione faints and is taken out. Leontes immediately repents."
"Of all encertainties himself commended , :
No richer than his honour : how he glisters :
Thorough my rust ! and how his pity :
Does my deeds make the blacker ! :
Re-enter PAULINA :
PAULINA :
Woe the while ! :
O , cut my lace , lest my heart , cracking it , :
Break too . :
First Lord :
What fit is this , good lady ? :
PAULINA :
What studied torments , tyrant , hast for me ? :
What wheels ? racks ? fires ? what flaying ? boiling ? :
In leads or oils ? what old or newer torture :
Must I receive , whose every word deserves :
To taste of thy most worst ? Thy tyranny :
Together working with thy jealousies , :
Fancies too weak for boys , too green and idle :
For girls of nine , O , think what they have done :
And then run mad indeed , stark mad ! for all :
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it . :
That thou betray 'dst Polixenes , ' twas nothing ; :
That did but show thee , of a fool , inconstant :
And damnable ingrateful : nor was 't much , :
Thou wouldst have poison 'd good Camillo 's honour , :
To have him kill a king : poor trespasses , :
More monstrous standing by : whereof I reckon :
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter :
To be or none or little ; though a devil :
Would have shed water out of fire ere done 't : :
Nor is 't directly laid to thee , the death :
Of the young prince , whose honourable thoughts , :
Thoughts high for one so tender , cleft the heart :
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire :
Blemish 'd his gracious dam : this is not , no , :
Laid to thy answer : but the last , --O lords , :
When I have said , cry ' woe ! ' the queen , the queen , :
The sweet 'st , dear 'st creature 's dead , :
and vengeance for 't :
Not dropp 'd down yet . :
First Lord :
The higher powers forbid ! :
PAULINA :
I say she 's dead ; I 'll swear 't . If word nor oath :
Prevail not , go and see : if you can bring :
Tincture or lustre in her lip , her eye , :
Heat outwardly or breath within , I 'll serve you :
As I would do the gods . But , O thou tyrant ! :
Do not repent these things , for they are heavier :
Than all thy woes can stir ; therefore betake thee :
To nothing but despair . A thousand knees :
Ten thousand years together , naked , fasting , :
Upon a barren mountain and still winter :
In storm perpetual , could not move the gods :
To look that way thou wert . :
LEONTES :
Go on , go on :
Thou canst not speak too much ; I have deserved :
All tongues to talk their bitterest . :
First Lord :
Say no more : :
Howe 'er the business goes , you have made fault :
I ' the boldness of your speech . :
PAULINA :
I am sorry for 't : :
All faults I make , when I shall come to know them , :
I do repent . Alas ! I have show 'd too much :
The rashness of a woman : he is touch 'd :
To the noble heart . What 's gone and what 's past help :
Should be past grief : do not receive affliction :
At my petition ; I beseech you , rather :
Let me be punish 'd , that have minded you :
Of what you should forget . Now , good my liege :
Sir , royal sir , forgive a foolish woman : :
The love I bore your queen--lo , fool again ! -- :
I 'll speak of her no more , nor of your children ; :
I 'll not remember you of my own lord , :
Who is lost too : take your patience to you , :
And I 'll say nothing . :
LEONTES :
Thou didst speak but well :
",Paulina returns to say that Hermione is dead. Leontes vows perpetual sorrow.
"Than to be pitied of thee . Prithee , bring me :
To the dead bodies of my queen and son : :
One grave shall be for both : upon them shall :
The causes of their death appear , unto :
Our shame perpetual . Once a day I 'll visit :
The chapel where they lie , and tears shed there :
Shall be my recreation : so long as nature :
Will bear up with this exercise , so long :
I daily vow to use it . Come and lead me :
Unto these sorrows . :
SCENE III . Bohemia . A desert country near the sea . :
ANTIGONUS :
Thou art perfect then , our ship hath touch 'd upon :
The deserts of Bohemia ? :
Mariner :
Ay , my lord : and fear :
We have landed in ill time : the skies look grimly :
And threaten present blusters . In my conscience , :
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry :
And frown upon ' s . :
ANTIGONUS :
Their sacred wills be done ! Go , get aboard ; :
Look to thy bark : I 'll not be long before :
I call upon thee . :
Mariner :
Make your best haste , and go not :
Too far i ' the land : ' tis like to be loud weather ; :
Besides , this place is famous for the creatures :
Of prey that keep upon 't . :
ANTIGONUS :
Go thou away : :
I 'll follow instantly . :
Mariner :
I am glad at heart :
To be so rid o ' the business . :
Exit :
ANTIGONUS :
Come , poor babe : :
I have heard , but not believed , :
the spirits o ' the dead :
May walk again : if such thing be , thy mother :
Appear 'd to me last night , for ne 'er was dream :
So like a waking . To me comes a creature , :
Sometimes her head on one side , some another ; :
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow , :
So fill 'd and so becoming : in pure white robes , :
Like very sanctity , she did approach :
My cabin where I lay ; thrice bow 'd before me , :
And gasping to begin some speech , her eyes :
Became two spouts : the fury spent , anon :
Did this break-from her : ' Good Antigonus , :
Since fate , against thy better disposition , :
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out :
Of my poor babe , according to thine oath , :
Places remote enough are in Bohemia , :
There weep and leave it crying ; and , for the babe :
Is counted lost for ever , Perdita , :
I prithee , call 't . For this ungentle business :
Put on thee by my lord , thou ne 'er shalt see :
Thy wife Paulina more . ' And so , with shrieks :
She melted into air . Affrighted much , :
I did in time collect myself and thought :
This was so and no slumber . Dreams are toys : :
Yet for this once , yea , superstitiously , :
I will be squared by this . I do believe :
Hermione hath suffer 'd death , and that :
Apollo would , this being indeed the issue :
Of King Polixenes , it should here be laid , :
Either for life or death , upon the earth :
Of its right father . Blossom , speed thee well ! :
There lie , and there thy character : there these ; :
Which may , if fortune please , both breed thee , pretty , :
And still rest thine . The storm begins ; poor wretch , :
That for thy mother 's fault art thus exposed :
To loss and what may follow ! Weep I cannot , :
But my heart bleeds ; and most accursed am I :
To be by oath enjoin 'd to this . Farewell ! :
The day frowns more and more : thou 'rt like to have :
A lullaby too rough : I never saw :
The heavens so dim by day . A savage clamour ! :
Well may I get aboard ! This is the chase : :
","In Bohemia, Antigonus reluctantly leaves the baby by itself, but as he starts to return home he is killed by a bear."
"Exit , pursued by a bear :
Shepherd :
I would there were no age between sixteen and :
three-and-twenty , or that youth would sleep out the :
rest ; for there is nothing in the between but :
getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , :
stealing , fighting--Hark you now ! Would any but :
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty :
hunt this weather ? They have scared away two of my :
best sheep , which I fear the wolf will sooner find :
than the master : if any where I have them , ' tis by :
the seaside , browsing of ivy . Good luck , an 't be thy :
will what have we here ! Mercy on ' s , a barne a very :
pretty barne ! A boy or a child , I wonder ? A :
pretty one ; a very pretty one : sure , some ' scape : :
though I am not bookish , yet I can read :
waiting-gentlewoman in the ' scape . This has been :
some stair-work , some trunk-work , some :
behind-door-work : they were warmer that got this :
than the poor thing is here . I 'll take it up for :
pity : yet I 'll tarry till my son come ; he hallooed :
but even now . Whoa , ho , hoa ! :
Clown :
Hilloa , loa ! :
Shepherd :
What , art so near ? If thou 'lt see a thing to talk :
on when thou art dead and rotten , come hither . What :
ailest thou , man ? :
Clown :
I have seen two such sights , by sea and by land ! :
but I am not to say it is a sea , for it is now the :
sky : betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust :
a bodkin 's point . :
Shepherd :
Why , boy , how is it ? :
Clown :
I would you did but see how it chafes , how it rages , :
how it takes up the shore ! but that 's not the :
point . O , the most piteous cry of the poor souls ! :
sometimes to see ' em , and not to see ' em ; now the :
ship boring the moon with her main-mast , and anon :
swallowed with yest and froth , as you 'ld thrust a :
cork into a hogshead . And then for the :
land-service , to see how the bear tore out his :
shoulder-bone ; how he cried to me for help and said :
his name was Antigonus , a nobleman . But to make an :
end of the ship , to see how the sea flap-dragoned :
it : but , first , how the poor souls roared , and the :
sea mocked them ; and how the poor gentleman roared :
and the bear mocked him , both roaring louder than :
the sea or weather . :
Shepherd :
Name of mercy , when was this , boy ? :
Clown :
Now , now : I have not winked since I saw these :
sights : the men are not yet cold under water , nor :
the bear half dined on the gentleman : he 's at it :
now . :
Shepherd :
Would I had been by , to have helped the old man ! :
Clown :
I would you had been by the ship side , to have :
helped her : there your charity would have lacked footing . :
Shepherd :
Heavy matters ! heavy matters ! but look thee here , :
boy . Now bless thyself : thou mettest with things :
dying , I with things newborn . Here 's a sight for :
thee ; look thee , a bearing-cloth for a squire 's :
child ! look thee here ; take up , take up , boy ; :
open 't . So , let 's see : it was told me I should be :
rich by the fairies . This is some changeling : :
open 't . What 's within , boy ? :
Clown :
You 're a made old man : if the sins of your youth :
are forgiven you , you 're well to live . Gold ! all gold ! :
","The baby is rescued and adopted by a Shepherd and his son, a Clown."
"This is fairy gold , boy , and ' twill prove so : up :
with 't , keep it close : home , home , the next way . :
We are lucky , boy ; and to be so still requires :
nothing but secrecy . Let my sheep go : come , good :
boy , the next way home . :
Clown :
Go you the next way with your findings . I 'll go see :
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much :
he hath eaten : they are never curst but when they :
are hungry : if there be any of him left , I 'll bury :
it . :
Shepherd :
That 's a good deed . If thou mayest discern by that :
which is left of him what he is , fetch me to the :
sight of him . :
Clown :
Marry , will I ; and you shall help to put him i ' the ground . :
Shepherd :
'Tis a lucky day , boy , and we 'll do good deeds on 't . :
ACT IV :
SCENE I : :
Time :
I , that please some , try all , both joy and terror :
Of good and bad , that makes and unfolds error , :
Now take upon me , in the name of Time , :
To use my wings . Impute it not a crime :
To me or my swift passage , that I slide :
O 'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried :
Of that wide gap , since it is in my power :
To o 'erthrow law and in one self-born hour :
To plant and o 'erwhelm custom . Let me pass :
The same I am , ere ancient 'st order was :
Or what is now received : I witness to :
The times that brought them in ; so shall I do :
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale :
The glistering of this present , as my tale :
Now seems to it . Your patience this allowing , :
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing :
As you had slept between : Leontes leaving , :
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving :
That he shuts up himself , imagine me , :
Gentle spectators , that I now may be :
In fair Bohemia , and remember well , :
I mentioned a son o ' the king 's , which Florizel :
I now name to you ; and with speed so pace :
To speak of Perdita , now grown in grace :
Equal with wondering : what of her ensues :
I list not prophecy ; but let Time 's news :
Be known when ' tis brought forth . :
A shepherd 's daughter , :
And what to her adheres , which follows after , :
Is the argument of Time . Of this allow , :
If ever you have spent time worse ere now ; :
If never , yet that Time himself doth say :
He wishes earnestly you never may . :
Exit :
SCENE II . Bohemia . The palace of POLIXENES . :
POLIXENES :
I pray thee , good Camillo , be no more importunate : :
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing ; a death to :
grant this . :
CAMILLO :
It is fifteen years since I saw my country : though :
I have for the most part been aired abroad , I :
desire to lay my bones there . Besides , the penitent :
king , my master , hath sent for me ; to whose feeling :
sorrows I might be some allay , or I o 'erween to :
think so , which is another spur to my departure . :
POLIXENES :
As thou lovest me , Camillo , wipe not out the rest of :
thy services by leaving me now : the need I have of :
thee thine own goodness hath made ; better not to :
have had thee than thus to want thee : thou , having :
made me businesses which none without thee can :
sufficiently manage , must either stay to execute :
them thyself or take away with thee the very :
services thou hast done ; which if I have not enough :
","The Chorus, Time, takes the play forward 16 years."
"thankful to thee shall be my study , and my profit :
therein the heaping friendships . Of that fatal :
country , Sicilia , prithee speak no more ; whose very :
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that :
penitent , as thou callest him , and reconciled king , :
my brother ; whose loss of his most precious queen :
and children are even now to be afresh lamented . :
Say to me , when sawest thou the Prince Florizel , my :
son ? Kings are no less unhappy , their issue not :
being gracious , than they are in losing them when :
they have approved their virtues . :
CAMILLO :
Sir , it is three days since I saw the prince . What :
his happier affairs may be , are to me unknown : but I :
have missingly noted , he is of late much retired :
from court and is less frequent to his princely :
exercises than formerly he hath appeared . :
POLIXENES :
I have considered so much , Camillo , and with some :
care ; so far that I have eyes under my service which :
look upon his removedness ; from whom I have this :
intelligence , that he is seldom from the house of a :
most homely shepherd ; a man , they say , that from :
very nothing , and beyond the imagination of his :
neighbours , is grown into an unspeakable estate . :
CAMILLO :
I have heard , sir , of such a man , who hath a :
daughter of most rare note : the report of her is :
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage . :
POLIXENES :
That 's likewise part of my intelligence ; but , I :
fear , the angle that plucks our son thither . Thou :
shalt accompany us to the place ; where we will , not :
appearing what we are , have some question with the :
shepherd ; from whose simplicity I think it not :
uneasy to get the cause of my son 's resort thither . :
Prithee , be my present partner in this business , and :
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia . :
CAMILLO :
I willingly obey your command . :
POLIXENES :
My best Camillo ! We must disguise ourselves . :
SCENE III . A road near the Shepherd 's cottage . :
AUTOLYCUS :
When daffodils begin to peer , :
With heigh ! the doxy over the dale , :
Why , then comes in the sweet o ' the year ; :
For the red blood reigns in the winter 's pale . :
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge , :
With heigh ! the sweet birds , O , how they sing ! :
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge ; :
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king . :
The lark , that tirra-lyra chants , :
With heigh ! with heigh ! the thrush and the jay , :
Are summer songs for me and my aunts , :
While we lie tumbling in the hay . :
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time :
wore three-pile ; but now I am out of service : :
But shall I go mourn for that , my dear ? :
The pale moon shines by night : :
And when I wander here and there , :
I then do most go right . :
If tinkers may have leave to live , :
And bear the sow-skin budget , :
Then my account I well may , give , :
And in the stocks avouch it . :
My traffic is sheets ; when the kite builds , look to :
lesser linen . My father named me Autolycus ; who :
being , as I am , littered under Mercury , was likewise :
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles . With die and :
drab I purchased this caparison , and my revenue is :
the silly cheat . Gallows and knock are too powerful :
on the highway : beating and hanging are terrors to :
me : for the life to come , I sleep out the thought :
of it . A prize ! a prize ! :
Clown :
","Autolycus, a roguish character, sings a playful song about the changing seasons and his own carefree lifestyle."
"yields pound and odd shilling ; fifteen hundred :
shorn. what comes the wool to ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
[ Aside ] :
If the springe hold , the cock 's mine . :
Clown :
I cannot do 't without counters . Let me see ; what am :
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast ? Three pound :
of sugar , five pound of currants , rice , --what will :
this sister of mine do with rice ? But my father :
hath made her mistress of the feast , and she lays it :
on . She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for :
the shearers , three-man-song-men all , and very good :
ones ; but they are most of them means and bases ; but :
one puritan amongst them , and he sings psalms to :
horn-pipes . I must have saffron to colour the warden :
pies ; mace ; dates ? --none , that 's out of my note ; :
nutmegs , seven ; a race or two of ginger , but that I :
may beg ; four pound of prunes , and as many of :
raisins o ' the sun . :
AUTOLYCUS :
O that ever I was born ! :
Grovelling on the ground :
Clown :
I ' the name of me-- :
AUTOLYCUS :
O , help me , help me ! pluck but off these rags ; and :
then , death , death ! :
Clown :
Alack , poor soul ! thou hast need of more rags to lay :
on thee , rather than have these off . :
AUTOLYCUS :
O sir , the loathsomeness of them offends me more :
than the stripes I have received , which are mighty :
ones and millions . :
Clown :
Alas , poor man ! a million of beating may come to a :
great matter . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I am robbed , sir , and beaten ; my money and apparel :
ta 'en from me , and these detestable things put upon :
me . :
Clown :
What , by a horseman , or a footman ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
A footman , sweet sir , a footman . :
Clown :
Indeed , he should be a footman by the garments he :
has left with thee : if this be a horseman 's coat , :
it hath seen very hot service . Lend me thy hand , :
I 'll help thee : come , lend me thy hand . :
AUTOLYCUS :
O , good sir , tenderly , O ! :
Clown :
Alas , poor soul ! :
AUTOLYCUS :
O , good sir , softly , good sir ! I fear , sir , my :
shoulder-blade is out . :
Clown :
How now ! canst stand ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
[ Picking his pocket ] :
Softly , dear sir ; good sir , softly . You ha ' done me :
a charitable office . :
Clown :
Dost lack any money ? I have a little money for thee . :
AUTOLYCUS :
No , good sweet sir ; no , I beseech you , sir : I have :
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence , :
unto whom I was going ; I shall there have money , or :
any thing I want : offer me no money , I pray you ; :
that kills my heart . :
Clown :
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
A fellow , sir , that I have known to go about with :
troll-my-dames ; I knew him once a servant of the :
prince : I cannot tell , good sir , for which of his :
virtues it was , but he was certainly whipped out of the court . :
Clown :
His vices , you would say ; there 's no virtue whipped :
out of the court : they cherish it to make it stay :
there ; and yet it will no more but abide . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Vices , I would say , sir . I know this man well : he :
hath been since an ape-bearer ; then a :
process-server , a bailiff ; then he compassed a :
motion of the Prodigal Son , and married a tinker 's :
",Autolycus is pretending to be a victim. The Clown initially sympathizes with him and offers to help.
"and , having flown over many knavish professions , he :
settled only in rogue : some call him Autolycus . :
Clown :
Out upon him ! prig , for my life , prig : he haunts :
wakes , fairs and bear-baitings . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Very true , sir ; he , sir , he ; that 's the rogue that :
put me into this apparel . :
Clown :
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia : if you had :
but looked big and spit at him , he 'ld have run . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I must confess to you , sir , I am no fighter : I am :
false of heart that way ; and that he knew , I warrant :
him . :
Clown :
How do you now ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Sweet sir , much better than I was ; I can stand and :
walk : I will even take my leave of you , and pace :
softly towards my kinsman 's . :
Clown :
Shall I bring thee on the way ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
No , good-faced sir ; no , sweet sir . :
Clown :
Then fare thee well : I must go buy spices for our :
sheep-shearing . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Prosper you , sweet sir ! :
Exit Clown :
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice . :
I 'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too : if I :
make not this cheat bring out another and the :
shearers prove sheep , let me be unrolled and my name :
put in the book of virtue ! :
Sings :
Jog on , jog on , the foot-path way , :
And merrily hent the stile-a : :
A merry heart goes all the day , :
Your sad tires in a mile-a . :
Exit :
SCENE IV . The Shepherd 's cottage . :
FLORIZEL :
These your unusual weeds to each part of you :
Do give a life : no shepherdess , but Flora :
Peering in April 's front . This your sheep-shearing :
Is as a meeting of the petty gods , :
And you the queen on 't . :
PERDITA :
Sir , my gracious lord , :
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me : :
O , pardon , that I name them ! Your high self , :
The gracious mark o ' the land , you have obscured :
With a swain 's wearing , and me , poor lowly maid , :
Most goddess-like prank 'd up : but that our feasts :
In every mess have folly and the feeders :
Digest it with a custom , I should blush :
To see you so attired , sworn , I think , :
To show myself a glass . :
FLORIZEL :
I bless the time :
When my good falcon made her flight across :
Thy father 's ground . :
PERDITA :
Now Jove afford you cause ! :
To me the difference forges dread ; your greatness :
Hath not been used to fear . Even now I tremble :
To think your father , by some accident , :
Should pass this way as you did : O , the Fates ! :
How would he look , to see his work so noble :
Vilely bound up ? What would he say ? Or how :
Should I , in these my borrow 'd flaunts , behold :
The sternness of his presence ? :
FLORIZEL :
Apprehend :
Nothing but jollity . The gods themselves , :
Humbling their deities to love , have taken :
The shapes of beasts upon them : Jupiter :
Became a bull , and bellow 'd ; the green Neptune :
A ram , and bleated ; and the fire-robed god , :
Golden Apollo , a poor humble swain , :
As I seem now . Their transformations :
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer , :
Nor in a way so chaste , since my desires :
Run not before mine honour , nor my lusts :
Burn hotter than my faith . :
PERDITA :
O , but , sir , :
Your resolution cannot hold , when ' tis :
Opposed , as it must be , by the power of the king : :
","Autolycus, the shepherd, and the clown converse about Autolycus' roguish nature and his current attire. Meanwhile, Florizel and Perdita are together in the shepherd's cottage. Florizel praises Perdita's appearance, but she expresses concern about the difference in their social statuses."
"Which then will speak , that you must :
change this purpose , :
Or I my life . :
FLORIZEL :
Thou dearest Perdita , :
With these forced thoughts , I prithee , darken not :
The mirth o ' the feast . Or I 'll be thine , my fair , :
Or not my father 's . For I cannot be :
Mine own , nor any thing to any , if :
I be not thine . To this I am most constant , :
Though destiny say no . Be merry , gentle ; :
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing :
That you behold the while . Your guests are coming : :
Lift up your countenance , as it were the day :
Of celebration of that nuptial which :
We two have sworn shall come . :
PERDITA :
O lady Fortune , :
Stand you auspicious ! :
FLORIZEL :
See , your guests approach : :
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly , :
And let 's be red with mirth . :
Shepherd :
Fie , daughter ! when my old wife lived , upon :
This day she was both pantler , butler , cook , :
Both dame and servant ; welcomed all , served all ; :
Would sing her song and dance her turn ; now here , :
At upper end o ' the table , now i ' the middle ; :
On his shoulder , and his ; her face o ' fire :
With labour and the thing she took to quench it , :
She would to each one sip . You are retired , :
As if you were a feasted one and not :
The hostess of the meeting : pray you , bid :
These unknown friends to 's welcome ; for it is :
A way to make us better friends , more known . :
Come , quench your blushes and present yourself :
That which you are , mistress o ' the feast : come on , :
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing , :
As your good flock shall prosper . :
PERDITA :
[ To POLIXENES ] Sir , welcome : :
It is my father 's will I should take on me :
The hostess-ship o ' the day . :
To CAMILLO :
You 're welcome , sir . :
Give me those flowers there , Dorcas . Reverend sirs , :
For you there 's rosemary and rue ; these keep :
Seeming and savour all the winter long : :
Grace and remembrance be to you both , :
And welcome to our shearing ! :
POLIXENES :
Shepherdess , :
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages :
With flowers of winter . :
PERDITA :
Sir , the year growing ancient , :
Not yet on summer 's death , nor on the birth :
Of trembling winter , the fairest :
flowers o ' the season :
Are our carnations and streak 'd gillyvors , :
Which some call nature 's bastards : of that kind :
Our rustic garden 's barren ; and I care not :
To get slips of them . :
POLIXENES :
Wherefore , gentle maiden , :
Do you neglect them ? :
PERDITA :
For I have heard it said :
There is an art which in their piedness shares :
With great creating nature . :
POLIXENES :
Say there be ; :
Yet nature is made better by no mean :
But nature makes that mean : so , over that art :
Which you say adds to nature , is an art :
That nature makes . You see , sweet maid , we marry :
A gentler scion to the wildest stock , :
And make conceive a bark of baser kind :
By bud of nobler race : this is an art :
Which does mend nature , change it rather , but :
The art itself is nature . :
PERDITA :
So it is . :
POLIXENES :
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors , :
And do not call them bastards . :
PERDITA :
I 'll not put :
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them ; :
No more than were I painted I would wish :
This youth should say ' twere well and only therefore :
","Polixenes and Camillo disguise themselves to be present at a sheep-shearing festival. Polixenes wants to find out what is going on with his son Florizel, who is in love with the Shepherd's adopted daughter, now called Perdita."
"Hot lavender , mints , savoury , marjoram ; :
The marigold , that goes to bed wi ' the sun :
And with him rises weeping : these are flowers :
Of middle summer , and I think they are given :
To men of middle age . You 're very welcome . :
CAMILLO :
I should leave grazing , were I of your flock , :
And only live by gazing . :
PERDITA :
Out , alas ! :
You 'd be so lean , that blasts of January :
Would blow you through and through . :
Now , my fair 'st friend , :
I would I had some flowers o ' the spring that might :
Become your time of day ; and yours , and yours , :
That wear upon your virgin branches yet :
Your maidenheads growing : O Proserpina , :
For the flowers now , that frighted thou let 'st fall :
From Dis 's waggon ! daffodils , :
That come before the swallow dares , and take :
The winds of March with beauty ; violets dim , :
But sweeter than the lids of Juno 's eyes :
Or Cytherea 's breath ; pale primroses :
That die unmarried , ere they can behold :
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady :
Most incident to maids ; bold oxlips and :
The crown imperial ; lilies of all kinds , :
The flower-de-luce being one ! O , these I lack , :
To make you garlands of , and my sweet friend , :
To strew him o 'er and o 'er ! :
FLORIZEL :
What , like a corse ? :
PERDITA :
No , like a bank for love to lie and play on ; :
Not like a corse ; or if , not to be buried , :
But quick and in mine arms . Come , take your flowers : :
Methinks I play as I have seen them do :
In Whitsun pastorals : sure this robe of mine :
Does change my disposition . :
FLORIZEL :
What you do :
Still betters what is done . When you speak , sweet . :
I 'ld have you do it ever : when you sing , :
I 'ld have you buy and sell so , so give alms , :
Pray so ; and , for the ordering your affairs , :
To sing them too : when you do dance , I wish you :
A wave o ' the sea , that you might ever do :
Nothing but that ; move still , still so , :
And own no other function : each your doing , :
So singular in each particular , :
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed , :
That all your acts are queens . :
PERDITA :
O Doricles , :
Your praises are too large : but that your youth , :
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through 't , :
Do plainly give you out an unstain 'd shepherd , :
With wisdom I might fear , my Doricles , :
You woo 'd me the false way . :
FLORIZEL :
I think you have :
As little skill to fear as I have purpose :
To put you to 't . But come ; our dance , I pray : :
Your hand , my Perdita : so turtles pair , :
That never mean to part . :
PERDITA :
I 'll swear for ' em . :
POLIXENES :
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever :
Ran on the green-sward : nothing she does or seems :
But smacks of something greater than herself , :
Too noble for this place . :
CAMILLO :
He tells her something :
That makes her blood look out : good sooth , she is :
The queen of curds and cream . :
Clown :
Come on , strike up ! :
DORCAS :
Mopsa must be your mistress : marry , garlic , :
To mend her kissing with ! :
MOPSA :
Now , in good time ! :
Clown :
Not a word , a word ; we stand upon our manners . :
Come , strike up ! :
Music . Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses :
POLIXENES :
Pray , good shepherd , what fair swain is this :
Which dances with your daughter ? :
","Dancing and singing take place, and Florizel and Perdita plan to marry. The scene is filled with merriment and dancing, with Perdita and Florizel's love on full display."
"They call him Doricles ; and boasts himself :
To have a worthy feeding : but I have it :
Upon his own report and I believe it ; :
He looks like sooth . He says he loves my daughter : :
I think so too ; for never gazed the moon :
Upon the water as he 'll stand and read :
As ' twere my daughter 's eyes : and , to be plain . :
I think there is not half a kiss to choose :
Who loves another best . :
POLIXENES :
She dances featly . :
Shepherd :
So she does any thing ; though I report it , :
That should be silent : if young Doricles :
Do light upon her , she shall bring him that :
Which he not dreams of . :
Servant :
O master , if you did but hear the pedlar at the :
door , you would never dance again after a tabour and :
pipe ; no , the bagpipe could not move you : he sings :
several tunes faster than you 'll tell money ; he :
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men 's :
ears grew to his tunes . :
Clown :
He could never come better ; he shall come in . I :
love a ballad but even too well , if it be doleful :
matter merrily set down , or a very pleasant thing :
indeed and sung lamentably . :
Servant :
He hath songs for man or woman , of all sizes ; no :
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves : he :
has the prettiest love-songs for maids ; so without :
bawdry , which is strange ; with such delicate :
burthens of dildos and fadings , ' jump her and thump :
her ; ' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would , :
as it were , mean mischief and break a foul gap into :
the matter , he makes the maid to answer ' Whoop , do me :
no harm , good man ; ' puts him off , slights him , with :
'Whoop , do me no harm , good man . ' :
POLIXENES :
This is a brave fellow . :
Clown :
Believe me , thou talkest of an admirable conceited :
fellow . Has he any unbraided wares ? :
Servant :
He hath ribbons of an the colours i ' the rainbow ; :
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can :
learnedly handle , though they come to him by the :
gross : inkles , caddisses , cambrics , lawns : why , he :
sings ' em over as they were gods or goddesses ; you :
would think a smock were a she-angel , he so chants :
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on 't . :
Clown :
Prithee bring him in ; and let him approach singing . :
PERDITA :
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in ' s tunes . :
Exit Servant :
Clown :
You have of these pedlars , that have more in them :
than you 'ld think , sister . :
PERDITA :
Ay , good brother , or go about to think . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Lawn as white as driven snow ; :
Cyprus black as e 'er was crow ; :
Gloves as sweet as damask roses ; :
Masks for faces and for noses ; :
Bugle bracelet , necklace amber , :
Perfume for a lady 's chamber ; :
Golden quoifs and stomachers , :
For my lads to give their dears : :
Pins and poking-sticks of steel , :
What maids lack from head to heel : :
Come buy of me , come ; come buy , come buy ; :
Buy lads , or else your lasses cry : Come buy . :
Clown :
If I were not in love with Mopsa , thou shouldst take :
no money of me ; but being enthralled as I am , it :
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves . :
MOPSA :
I was promised them against the feast ; but they come :
not too late now . :
DORCAS :
He hath promised you more than that , or there be liars . :
MOPSA :
",The shepherd and Polixenes discuss Florizel's affection for Perdita. The shepherd praises Florizel's love for his daughter. They observe Perdita dancing and Polixenes comments on her grace.
"paid you more , which will shame you to give him again . :
Clown :
Is there no manners left among maids ? will they :
wear their plackets where they should bear their :
faces ? Is there not milking-time , when you are :
going to bed , or kiln-hole , to whistle off these :
secrets , but you must be tittle-tattling before all :
our guests ? ' tis well they are whispering : clamour :
your tongues , and not a word more . :
MOPSA :
I have done . Come , you promised me a tawdry-lace :
and a pair of sweet gloves . :
Clown :
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way :
and lost all my money ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
And indeed , sir , there are cozeners abroad ; :
therefore it behoves men to be wary . :
Clown :
Fear not thou , man , thou shalt lose nothing here . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I hope so , sir ; for I have about me many parcels of charge . :
Clown :
What hast here ? ballads ? :
MOPSA :
Pray now , buy some : I love a ballad in print o ' :
life , for then we are sure they are true . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Here 's one to a very doleful tune , how a usurer 's :
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a :
burthen and how she longed to eat adders ' heads and :
toads carbonadoed . :
MOPSA :
Is it true , think you ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Very true , and but a month old . :
DORCAS :
Bless me from marrying a usurer ! :
AUTOLYCUS :
Here 's the midwife 's name to 't , one Mistress :
Tale-porter , and five or six honest wives that were :
present . Why should I carry lies abroad ? :
MOPSA :
Pray you now , buy it . :
Clown :
Come on , lay it by : and let 's first see moe :
ballads ; we 'll buy the other things anon . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Here 's another ballad of a fish , that appeared upon :
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April , :
forty thousand fathom above water , and sung this :
ballad against the hard hearts of maids : it was :
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold :
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that :
loved her : the ballad is very pitiful and as true . :
DORCAS :
Is it true too , think you ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Five justices ' hands at it , and witnesses more than :
my pack will hold . :
Clown :
Lay it by too : another . :
AUTOLYCUS :
This is a merry ballad , but a very pretty one . :
MOPSA :
Let 's have some merry ones . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Why , this is a passing merry one and goes to :
the tune of ' Two maids wooing a man : ' there 's :
scarce a maid westward but she sings it ; ' tis in :
request , I can tell you . :
MOPSA :
We can both sing it : if thou 'lt bear a part , thou :
shalt hear ; ' tis in three parts . :
DORCAS :
We had the tune on 't a month ago . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I can bear my part ; you must know ' tis my :
occupation ; have at it with you . :
SONG :
AUTOLYCUS :
Get you hence , for I must go :
Where it fits not you to know . :
DORCAS :
Whither ? :
MOPSA :
O , whither ? :
DORCAS :
Whither ? :
MOPSA :
It becomes thy oath full well , :
Thou to me thy secrets tell . :
DORCAS :
Me too , let me go thither . :
MOPSA :
Or thou goest to the orange or mill . :
DORCAS :
If to either , thou dost ill . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Neither . :
DORCAS :
What , neither ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Neither . :
DORCAS :
Thou hast sworn my love to be . :
MOPSA :
Thou hast sworn it more to me : :
",The scene continues with Autolycus offering ballads for sale. The clown and the shepherd's daughters discuss the ballads.
"Clown :
We 'll have this song out anon by ourselves : my :
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk , and we 'll :
not trouble them . Come , bring away thy pack after :
me . Wenches , I 'll buy for you both . Pedlar , let 's :
have the first choice . Follow me , girls . :
Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA :
AUTOLYCUS :
And you shall pay well for ' em . :
Follows singing :
Will you buy any tape , :
Or lace for your cape , :
My dainty duck , my dear-a ? :
Any silk , any thread , :
Any toys for your head , :
Of the new 'st and finest , finest wear-a ? :
Come to the pedlar ; :
Money 's a medler . :
That doth utter all men 's ware-a . :
Exit :
Re-enter Servant :
Servant :
Master , there is three carters , three shepherds , :
three neat-herds , three swine-herds , that have made :
themselves all men of hair , they call themselves :
Saltiers , and they have a dance which the wenches :
say is a gallimaufry of gambols , because they are :
not in 't ; but they themselves are o ' the mind , if it :
be not too rough for some that know little but :
bowling , it will please plentifully . :
Shepherd :
Away ! we 'll none on ' t : here has been too much :
homely foolery already . I know , sir , we weary you . :
POLIXENES :
You weary those that refresh us : pray , let 's see :
these four threes of herdsmen . :
Servant :
One three of them , by their own report , sir , hath :
danced before the king ; and not the worst of the :
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier . :
Shepherd :
Leave your prating : since these good men are :
pleased , let them come in ; but quickly now . :
Servant :
Why , they stay at door , sir . :
Exit :
Here a dance of twelve Satyrs :
POLIXENES :
O , father , you 'll know more of that hereafter . :
To CAMILLO :
Is it not too far gone ? ' Tis time to part them . :
He 's simple and tells much . :
To FLORIZEL :
How now , fair shepherd ! :
Your heart is full of something that does take :
Your mind from feasting . Sooth , when I was young :
And handed love as you do , I was wont :
To load my she with knacks : I would have ransack 'd :
The pedlar 's silken treasury and have pour 'd it :
To her acceptance ; you have let him go :
And nothing marted with him . If your lass :
Interpretation should abuse and call this :
Your lack of love or bounty , you were straited :
For a reply , at least if you make a care :
Of happy holding her . :
FLORIZEL :
Old sir , I know :
She prizes not such trifles as these are : :
The gifts she looks from me are pack 'd and lock 'd :
Up in my heart ; which I have given already , :
But not deliver 'd . O , hear me breathe my life :
Before this ancient sir , who , it should seem , :
Hath sometime loved ! I take thy hand , this hand , :
As soft as dove 's down and as white as it , :
Or Ethiopian 's tooth , or the fann 'd :
snow that 's bolted :
By the northern blasts twice o 'er . :
POLIXENES :
What follows this ? :
How prettily the young swain seems to wash :
The hand was fair before ! I have put you out : :
But to your protestation ; let me hear :
What you profess . :
FLORIZEL :
Do , and be witness to ' t . :
POLIXENES :
And this my neighbour too ? :
FLORIZEL :
And he , and more :
Than he , and men , the earth , the heavens , and all : :
","The scene showcases Florizel's sincere affection and determination to win Perdita's heart, even in the face of potential challenges from her father, Polixenes."
"Thereof most worthy , were I the fairest youth :
That ever made eye swerve , had force and knowledge :
More than was ever man 's , I would not prize them :
Without her love ; for her employ them all ; :
Commend them and condemn them to her service :
Or to their own perdition . :
POLIXENES :
Fairly offer 'd . :
CAMILLO :
This shows a sound affection . :
Shepherd :
But , my daughter , :
Say you the like to him ? :
PERDITA :
I cannot speak :
So well , nothing so well ; no , nor mean better : :
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out :
The purity of his . :
Shepherd :
Take hands , a bargain ! :
And , friends unknown , you shall bear witness to ' t : :
I give my daughter to him , and will make :
Her portion equal his . :
FLORIZEL :
O , that must be :
I ' the virtue of your daughter : one being dead , :
I shall have more than you can dream of yet ; :
Enough then for your wonder . But , come on , :
Contract us ' fore these witnesses . :
Shepherd :
Come , your hand ; :
And , daughter , yours . :
POLIXENES :
Soft , swain , awhile , beseech you ; :
Have you a father ? :
FLORIZEL :
I have : but what of him ? :
POLIXENES :
Knows he of this ? :
FLORIZEL :
He neither does nor shall . :
POLIXENES :
Methinks a father :
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest :
That best becomes the table . Pray you once more , :
Is not your father grown incapable :
Of reasonable affairs ? is he not stupid :
With age and altering rheums ? can he speak ? hear ? :
Know man from man ? dispute his own estate ? :
Lies he not bed-rid ? and again does nothing :
But what he did being childish ? :
FLORIZEL :
No , good sir ; :
He has his health and ampler strength indeed :
Than most have of his age . :
POLIXENES :
By my white beard , :
You offer him , if this be so , a wrong :
Something unfilial : reason my son :
Should choose himself a wife , but as good reason :
The father , all whose joy is nothing else :
But fair posterity , should hold some counsel :
In such a business . :
FLORIZEL :
I yield all this ; :
But for some other reasons , my grave sir , :
Which ' tis not fit you know , I not acquaint :
My father of this business . :
POLIXENES :
Let him know 't . :
FLORIZEL :
He shall not . :
POLIXENES :
Prithee , let him . :
FLORIZEL :
No , he must not . :
Shepherd :
Let him , my son : he shall not need to grieve :
At knowing of thy choice . :
FLORIZEL :
Come , come , he must not . :
Mark our contract . :
POLIXENES :
Mark your divorce , young sir , :
Discovering himself :
Whom son I dare not call ; thou art too base :
To be acknowledged : thou a sceptre 's heir , :
That thus affect 'st a sheep-hook ! Thou old traitor , :
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can :
But shorten thy life one week . And thou , fresh piece :
Of excellent witchcraft , who of force must know :
The royal fool thou copest with , -- :
Shepherd :
O , my heart ! :
POLIXENES :
I 'll have thy beauty scratch 'd with briers , and made :
More homely than thy state . For thee , fond boy , :
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh :
That thou no more shalt see this knack , as never :
I mean thou shalt , we 'll bar thee from succession ; :
Not hold thee of our blood , no , not our kin , :
Far than Deucalion off : mark thou my words : :
Follow us to the court . Thou churl , for this time , :

Worthy enough a herdsman : yea , him too , :
That makes himself , but for our honour therein , :
Unworthy thee , --if ever henceforth thou :
These rural latches to his entrance open , :
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces , :
I will devise a death as cruel for thee :
As thou art tender to 't . :

PERDITA :
Even here undone ! :
I was not much afeard ; for once or twice :
I was about to speak and tell him plainly , :
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court :
Hides not his visage from our cottage but :
Looks on alike . Will 't please you , sir , be gone ? :
I told you what would come of this : beseech you , :
Of your own state take care : this dream of mine , -- :
Being now awake , I 'll queen it no inch farther , :
But milk my ewes and weep . :
CAMILLO :
Why , how now , father ! :
Speak ere thou diest . :
Shepherd :
I cannot speak , nor think :
Nor dare to know that which I know . O sir ! :
You have undone a man of fourscore three , :
That thought to fill his grave in quiet , yea , :
To die upon the bed my father died , :
To lie close by his honest bones : but now :
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me :
Where no priest shovels in dust . O cursed wretch , :
That knew 'st this was the prince , :
and wouldst adventure :
To mingle faith with him ! Undone ! undone ! :
If I might die within this hour , I have lived :
To die when I desire . :

Why look you so upon me ? :
I am but sorry , not afeard ; delay 'd , :
But nothing alter 'd : what I was , I am ; :
More straining on for plucking back , not following :
My leash unwillingly . :
CAMILLO :
Gracious my lord , :
You know your father 's temper : at this time :
He will allow no speech , which I do guess :
You do not purpose to him ; and as hardly :
Will he endure your sight as yet , I fear : :
Then , till the fury of his highness settle , :
Come not before him . :
FLORIZEL :
I not purpose it . :
I think , Camillo ? :
CAMILLO :
Even he , my lord . :
PERDITA :
How often have I told you ' twould be thus ! :
How often said , my dignity would last :
But till ' twere known ! :
FLORIZEL :
It cannot fail but by :
The violation of my faith ; and then :
Let nature crush the sides o ' the earth together :
And mar the seeds within ! Lift up thy looks : :
From my succession wipe me , father ; I :
Am heir to my affection . :
CAMILLO :
Be advised . :
FLORIZEL :
I am , and by my fancy : if my reason :
Will thereto be obedient , I have reason ; :
If not , my senses , better pleased with madness , :
Do bid it welcome . :
CAMILLO :
This is desperate , sir . :
FLORIZEL :
So call it : but it does fulfil my vow ; :
I needs must think it honesty . Camillo , :
Not for Bohemia , nor the pomp that may :
Be thereat glean 'd , for all the sun sees or :
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides :
In unknown fathoms , will I break my oath :
To this my fair beloved : therefore , I pray you , :
As you have ever been my father 's honour 'd friend , :
When he shall miss me , --as , in faith , I mean not :
To see him any more , --cast your good counsels :
Upon his passion ; let myself and fortune :
Tug for the time to come . This you may know :
",Florizel expresses his determination to follow through with his love for Perdita. He mentions that he will be leaving Bohemia and asks Camillo to offer counsel to his father in his absence.
"With her whom here I cannot hold on shore ; :
And most opportune to our need I have :
A vessel rides fast by , but not prepared :
For this design . What course I mean to hold :
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge , nor :
Concern me the reporting . :
CAMILLO :
O my lord ! :
I would your spirit were easier for advice , :
Or stronger for your need . :
FLORIZEL :
Hark , Perdita :
Drawing her aside :
I 'll hear you by and by . :
CAMILLO :
He 's irremoveable , :
Resolved for flight . Now were I happy , if :
His going I could frame to serve my turn , :
Save him from danger , do him love and honour , :
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia :
And that unhappy king , my master , whom :
I so much thirst to see . :
FLORIZEL :
Now , good Camillo ; :
I am so fraught with curious business that :
I leave out ceremony . :
CAMILLO :
Sir , I think :
You have heard of my poor services , i ' the love :
That I have borne your father ? :
FLORIZEL :
Very nobly :
Have you deserved : it is my father 's music :
To speak your deeds , not little of his care :
To have them recompensed as thought on . :
CAMILLO :
Well , my lord , :
If you may please to think I love the king :
And through him what is nearest to him , which is :
Your gracious self , embrace but my direction : :
If your more ponderous and settled project :
May suffer alteration , on mine honour , :
I 'll point you where you shall have such receiving :
As shall become your highness ; where you may :
Enjoy your mistress , from the whom , I see , :
There 's no disjunction to be made , but by-- :
As heavens forefend ! --your ruin ; marry her , :
And , with my best endeavours in your absence , :
Your discontenting father strive to qualify :
And bring him up to liking . :
FLORIZEL :
How , Camillo , :
May this , almost a miracle , be done ? :
That I may call thee something more than man :
And after that trust to thee . :
CAMILLO :
Have you thought on :
A place whereto you 'll go ? :
FLORIZEL :
Not any yet : :
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty :
To what we wildly do , so we profess :
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies :
Of every wind that blows . :
CAMILLO :
Then list to me : :
This follows , if you will not change your purpose :
But undergo this flight , make for Sicilia , :
And there present yourself and your fair princess , :
For so I see she must be , ' fore Leontes : :
She shall be habited as it becomes :
The partner of your bed . Methinks I see :
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping :
His welcomes forth ; asks thee the son forgiveness , :
As ' twere i ' the father 's person ; kisses the hands :
Of your fresh princess ; o 'er and o 'er divides him :
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness ; the one :
He chides to hell and bids the other grow :
Faster than thought or time . :
FLORIZEL :
Worthy Camillo , :
What colour for my visitation shall I :
Hold up before him ? :
CAMILLO :
Sent by the king your father :
To greet him and to give him comforts . Sir , :
The manner of your bearing towards him , with :
What you as from your father shall deliver , :
Things known betwixt us three , I 'll write you down : :
The which shall point you forth at every sitting :
What you must say ; that he shall not perceive :
But that you have your father 's bosom there :
And speak his very heart . :
FLORIZEL :
I am bound to you : :
There is some sap in this . :
CAMILLO :
A cause more promising :
","With the help of Camillo the two lovers escape to Sicilia, where the now pious Leontes still visits his wife's tomb. Camillo outlines a plan for Florizel's departure and his eventual return to Sicilia with Perdita."
"To unpath 'd waters , undream 'd shores , most certain :
To miseries enough ; no hope to help you , :
But as you shake off one to take another ; :
Nothing so certain as your anchors , who :
Do their best office , if they can but stay you :
Where you 'll be loath to be : besides you know :
Prosperity 's the very bond of love , :
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together :
Affliction alters . :
PERDITA :
One of these is true : :
I think affliction may subdue the cheek , :
But not take in the mind . :
CAMILLO :
Yea , say you so ? :
There shall not at your father 's house these :
seven years :
Be born another such . :
FLORIZEL :
My good Camillo , :
She is as forward of her breeding as :
She is i ' the rear our birth . :
CAMILLO :
I cannot say ' tis pity :
She lacks instructions , for she seems a mistress :
To most that teach . :
PERDITA :
Your pardon , sir ; for this :
I 'll blush you thanks . :
FLORIZEL :
My prettiest Perdita ! :
But O , the thorns we stand upon ! Camillo , :

The medicine of our house , how shall we do ? :
We are not furnish 'd like Bohemia 's son , :

AUTOLYCUS :
Ha , ha ! what a fool Honesty is ! and Trust , his :
sworn brother , a very simple gentleman ! I have sold :
all my trumpery ; not a counterfeit stone , not a :
ribbon , glass , pomander , brooch , table-book , ballad , :
knife , tape , glove , shoe-tie , bracelet , horn-ring , :
to keep my pack from fasting : they throng who :
should buy first , as if my trinkets had been :
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer : :
by which means I saw whose purse was best in :
picture ; and what I saw , to my good use I :
remembered . My clown , who wants but something to :
be a reasonable man , grew so in love with the :
wenches ' song , that he would not stir his pettitoes :
till he had both tune and words ; which so drew the :
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses :
stuck in ears : you might have pinched a placket , it :
was senseless ; ' twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a :
purse ; I could have filed keys off that hung in :
chains : no hearing , no feeling , but my sir 's song , :
and admiring the nothing of it . So that in this :
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their :
festival purses ; and had not the old man come in :
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king 's :
son and scared my choughs from the chaff , I had not :
left a purse alive in the whole army . :
CAMILLO , FLORIZEL , and PERDITA come forward :
CAMILLO :
Nay , but my letters , by this means being there :
So soon as you arrive , shall clear that doubt . :
FLORIZEL :
And those that you 'll procure from King Leontes-- :
CAMILLO :
Shall satisfy your father . :
PERDITA :
Happy be you ! :
All that you speak shows fair . :
CAMILLO :
Who have we here ? :
Seeing AUTOLYCUS :
We 'll make an instrument of this , omit :
Nothing may give us aid . :
AUTOLYCUS :

AUTOLYCUS :
I am a poor fellow , sir . :
CAMILLO :
Why , be so still ; here 's nobody will steal that from :
thee : yet for the outside of thy poverty we must :
make an exchange ; therefore discase thee instantly , :
--thou must think there 's a necessity in 't , --and :
change garments with this gentleman : though the :
pennyworth on his side be the worst , yet hold thee , :
there 's some boot . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I am a poor fellow , sir . :

I know ye well enough . :
CAMILLO :
Nay , prithee , dispatch : the gentleman is half :
flayed already . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Are you in earnest , sir ? :
Aside :
I smell the trick on 't . :
FLORIZEL :
Dispatch , I prithee . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Indeed , I have had earnest : but I cannot with :
conscience take it . :
CAMILLO :
Unbuckle , unbuckle . :
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments :
Fortunate mistress , --let my prophecy :
Come home to ye ! --you must retire yourself :
Into some covert : take your sweetheart 's hat :
And pluck it o 'er your brows , muffle your face , :
Dismantle you , and , as you can , disliken :
The truth of your own seeming ; that you may-- :
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard :
Get undescried . :

That I must bear a part . :

No remedy . :
Have you done there ? :

He would not call me son . :
CAMILLO :
Nay , you shall have no hat . :

Come , lady , come . Farewell , my friend . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Adieu , sir . :
FLORIZEL :
O Perdita , what have we twain forgot ! :
Pray you , a word . :
CAMILLO :
[ Aside ] What I do next , shall be to tell the king :
Of this escape and whither they are bound ; :
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail :
To force him after : in whose company :
I shall review Sicilia , for whose sight :
I have a woman 's longing . :
FLORIZEL :
Fortune speed us ! :
Thus we set on , Camillo , to the sea-side . :
CAMILLO :
The swifter speed the better . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I understand the business , I hear it : to have an :
open ear , a quick eye , and a nimble hand , is :
necessary for a cut-purse ; a good nose is requisite :
also , to smell out work for the other senses . I see :
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive . :
What an exchange had this been without boot ! What :
a boot is here with this exchange ! Sure the gods do :
this year connive at us , and we may do any thing :
extempore . The prince himself is about a piece of :
iniquity , stealing away from his father with his :
clog at his heels : if I thought it were a piece of :
honesty to acquaint the king withal , I would not :
do 't : I hold it the more knavery to conceal it ; :
and therein am I constant to my profession . :

Your worship had like to have given us one , if you :
had not taken yourself with the manner . :
Shepherd :
Are you a courtier , an 't like you , sir ? :

Whether it like me or no , I am a courtier . Seest :
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings ? :
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court ? :
receives not thy nose court-odor from me ? reflect I :
not on thy baseness court-contempt ? Thinkest thou , :

SCENE I. A room in LEONTES ' palace . :
CLEOMENES :
Sir , you have done enough , and have perform 'd :
A saint-like sorrow : no fault could you make , :
Which you have not redeem 'd ; indeed , paid down :
More penitence than done trespass : at the last , :
Do as the heavens have done , forget your evil ; :
With them forgive yourself . :
LEONTES :
Whilst I remember :
Her and her virtues , I cannot forget :
My blemishes in them , and so still think of :
The wrong I did myself ; which was so much , :
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and :
Destroy 'd the sweet 'st companion that e 'er man :
Bred his hopes out of . :
PAULINA :
True , too true , my lord : :
If , one by one , you wedded all the world , :
Or from the all that are took something good , :
To make a perfect woman , she you kill 'd :
Would be unparallel 'd . :
LEONTES :
I think so . Kill 'd ! :
She I kill 'd ! I did so : but thou strikest me :
Sorely , to say I did ; it is as bitter :
Upon thy tongue as in my thought : now , good now , :
Say so but seldom . :
CLEOMENES :
Not at all , good lady : :
You might have spoken a thousand things that would :
Have done the time more benefit and graced :
Your kindness better . :
PAULINA :
You are one of those :
Would have him wed again . :
DION :
If you would not so , :
You pity not the state , nor the remembrance :
Of his most sovereign name ; consider little :
What dangers , by his highness ' fail of issue , :
May drop upon his kingdom and devour :
Incertain lookers on . What were more holy :
Than to rejoice the former queen is well ? :
What holier than , for royalty 's repair , :
For present comfort and for future good , :
To bless the bed of majesty again :
With a sweet fellow to 't ? :
PAULINA :
There is none worthy , :
Respecting her that 's gone . Besides , the gods :
Will have fulfill 'd their secret purposes ; :
For has not the divine Apollo said , :
Is 't not the tenor of his oracle , :
That King Leontes shall not have an heir :
Till his lost child be found ? which that it shall , :
Is all as monstrous to our human reason :
As my Antigonus to break his grave :
And come again to me ; who , on my life , :
Did perish with the infant . ' Tis your counsel :
My lord should to the heavens be contrary , :
Oppose against their wills . :
To LEONTES :
Care not for issue ; :
The crown will find an heir : great Alexander :
Left his to the worthiest ; so his successor :
Was like to be the best . :
LEONTES :
Good Paulina , :
",Cleomenes and Paulina talk to Leontes about his remorse and penitence for his past actions. Leontes laments the wrong he did to himself and the destruction he caused by his jealousy. 
"I know , in honour , O , that ever I :
Had squared me to thy counsel ! then , even now , :
I might have look 'd upon my queen 's full eyes , :
Have taken treasure from her lips-- :
PAULINA :
And left them :
More rich for what they yielded . :
LEONTES :
Thou speak 'st truth . :
No more such wives ; therefore , no wife : one worse , :
And better used , would make her sainted spirit :
Again possess her corpse , and on this stage , :
Where we 're offenders now , appear soul-vex 'd , :
And begin , ' Why to me ? ' :
PAULINA :

She had just cause . :
LEONTES :
She had ; and would incense me :
To murder her I married . :
PAULINA :
I should so . :
Were I the ghost that walk 'd , I 'ld bid you mark :
Her eye , and tell me for what dull part in 't :
You chose her ; then I 'ld shriek , that even your ears :
Should rift to hear me ; and the words that follow 'd :
Should be ' Remember mine . ' :
LEONTES :
Stars , stars , :
And all eyes else dead coals ! Fear thou no wife ; :
I 'll have no wife , Paulina . :
PAULINA :
Will you swear :
Never to marry but by my free leave ? :
LEONTES :
Never , Paulina ; so be blest my spirit ! :
PAULINA :
Then , good my lords , bear witness to his oath . :
CLEOMENES :
You tempt him over-much . :
PAULINA :
Unless another , :
As like Hermione as is her picture , :
Affront his eye . :
CLEOMENES :
Good madam , -- :
PAULINA :
I have done . :
Yet , if my lord will marry , --if you will , sir , :
No remedy , but you will , --give me the office :
To choose you a queen : she shall not be so young :
As was your former ; but she shall be such :
As , walk 'd your first queen 's ghost , :
it should take joy :
To see her in your arms . :
LEONTES :
My true Paulina , :
We shall not marry till thou bid 'st us . :
PAULINA :
That :
Shall be when your first queen 's again in breath ; :
Never till then . :

Son of Polixenes , with his princess , she :

So out of circumstance and sudden , tells us :

By need and accident . What train ? :

Ay , the most peerless piece of earth , I think , :
That e 'er the sun shone bright on . :
PAULINA :
O Hermione , :
As every present time doth boast itself :
Above a better gone , so must thy grave :
Give way to what 's seen now ! Sir , you yourself :
Have said and writ so , but your writing now :
Is colder than that theme , ' She had not been , :
Nor was not to be equall 'd ; ' --thus your verse :
Flow 'd with her beauty once : ' tis shrewdly ebb 'd , :
To say you have seen a better . :
Gentleman :
Pardon , madam : :
The one I have almost forgot , --your pardon , -- :
The other , when she has obtain 'd your eye , :
Will have your tongue too . This is a creature , :
Would she begin a sect , might quench the zeal :
Of all professors else , make proselytes :
Of who she but bid follow . :
PAULINA :
How ! not women ? :
Gentleman :
","Leontes reflects on how he should have listened to Paulina's counsel earlier. A messenger arrives to announce the arrival of Prince Florizel, son of Polixenes, and his princess."
"More worth than any man ; men , that she is :
The rarest of all women . :
LEONTES :
Go , Cleomenes ; :
Yourself , assisted with your honour 'd friends , :
Bring them to our embracement . Still , ' tis strange :
He thus should steal upon us . :
PAULINA :
Had our prince , :
Jewel of children , seen this hour , he had pair 'd :
Well with this lord : there was not full a month :
Between their births . :
LEONTES :
Prithee , no more ; cease ; thou know 'st :
He dies to me again when talk 'd of : sure , :
When I shall see this gentleman , thy speeches :
Will bring me to consider that which may :
Unfurnish me of reason . They are come . :
Re-enter CLEOMENES and others , with FLORIZEL and PERDITA :
Your mother was most true to wedlock , prince ; :
For she did print your royal father off , :
Conceiving you : were I but twenty-one , :
Your father 's image is so hit in you , :
His very air , that I should call you brother , :
As I did him , and speak of something wildly :
By us perform 'd before . Most dearly welcome ! :
And your fair princess , --goddess ! --O , alas ! :
I lost a couple , that ' twixt heaven and earth :
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as :
You , gracious couple , do : and then I lost-- :
All mine own folly--the society , :
Amity too , of your brave father , whom , :
Though bearing misery , I desire my life :
Once more to look on him . :
FLORIZEL :
By his command :
Have I here touch 'd Sicilia and from him :
Give you all greetings that a king , at friend , :
Can send his brother : and , but infirmity :
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized :
His wish 'd ability , he had himself :
The lands and waters ' twixt your throne and his :
Measured to look upon you ; whom he loves-- :
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres :
And those that bear them living . :
LEONTES :
O my brother , :
Good gentleman ! the wrongs I have done thee stir :
Afresh within me , and these thy offices , :
So rarely kind , are as interpreters :
Of my behind-hand slackness . Welcome hither , :
As is the spring to the earth . And hath he too :
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage , :
At least ungentle , of the dreadful Neptune , :
To greet a man not worth her pains , much less :
The adventure of her person ? :
FLORIZEL :
Good my lord , :
She came from Libya . :
LEONTES :
Where the warlike Smalus , :
That noble honour 'd lord , is fear 'd and loved ? :
FLORIZEL :
Most royal sir , from thence ; from him , whose daughter :
His tears proclaim 'd his , parting with her : thence , :
A prosperous south-wind friendly , we have cross 'd , :
To execute the charge my father gave me :
For visiting your highness : my best train :
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss 'd ; :
Who for Bohemia bend , to signify :
Not only my success in Libya , sir , :
But my arrival and my wife 's in safety :
Here where we are . :
LEONTES :
The blessed gods :
Purge all infection from our air whilst you :
Do climate here ! You have a holy father , :
A graceful gentleman ; against whose person , :
So sacred as it is , I have done sin : :
For which the heavens , taking angry note , :
Have left me issueless ; and your father 's blest , :
As he from heaven merits it , with you :
Worthy his goodness . What might I have been , :
Might I a son and daughter now have look 'd on , :
Such goodly things as you ! :
Lord :
Most noble sir , :
That which I shall report will bear no credit , :
","Florizel and Perdita have arrived, and Leontes welcomes them. He expresses his regret for his past actions and praises Perdita's beauty."
"Bohemia greets you from himself by me ; :
Desires you to attach his son , who has-- :
His dignity and duty both cast off-- :
Fled from his father , from his hopes , and with :
A shepherd 's daughter . :
LEONTES :
Where 's Bohemia ? speak . :
Lord :
Here in your city ; I now came from him : :
I speak amazedly ; and it becomes :
My marvel and my message . To your court :
Whiles he was hastening , in the chase , it seems , :
Of this fair couple , meets he on the way :
The father of this seeming lady and :
Her brother , having both their country quitted :
With this young prince . :
FLORIZEL :
Camillo has betray 'd me ; :
Whose honour and whose honesty till now :
Endured all weathers . :
Lord :
Lay 't so to his charge : :
He 's with the king your father . :
LEONTES :
Who ? Camillo ? :
Lord :
Camillo , sir ; I spake with him ; who now :
Has these poor men in question . Never saw I :
Wretches so quake : they kneel , they kiss the earth ; :
Forswear themselves as often as they speak : :
Bohemia stops his ears , and threatens them :
With divers deaths in death . :
PERDITA :
O my poor father ! :
The heaven sets spies upon us , will not have :
Our contract celebrated . :
LEONTES :
You are married ? :
FLORIZEL :
We are not , sir , nor are we like to be ; :
The stars , I see , will kiss the valleys first : :
The odds for high and low 's alike . :
LEONTES :
My lord , :
Is this the daughter of a king ? :
FLORIZEL :
She is , :
When once she is my wife . :
LEONTES :
That ' once ' I see by your good father 's speed :
Will come on very slowly . I am sorry , :
Most sorry , you have broken from his liking :
Where you were tied in duty , and as sorry :
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty , :
That you might well enjoy her . :
FLORIZEL :
Dear , look up : :
Though Fortune , visible an enemy , :
Should chase us with my father , power no jot :
Hath she to change our loves . Beseech you , sir , :
Remember since you owed no more to time :
Than I do now : with thought of such affections , :
Step forth mine advocate ; at your request :
My father will grant precious things as trifles . :
LEONTES :
Would he do so , I 'ld beg your precious mistress , :
Which he counts but a trifle . :
PAULINA :
Sir , my liege , :
Your eye hath too much youth in 't : not a month :
'Fore your queen died , she was more worth such gazes :
Than what you look on now . :
LEONTES :
I thought of her , :
Even in these looks I made . :
To FLORIZEL :
But your petition :
Is yet unanswer 'd . I will to your father : :
Your honour not o 'erthrown by your desires , :
I am friend to them and you : upon which errand :
I now go toward him ; therefore follow me :
And mark what way I make : come , good my lord . :
SCENE II . Before LEONTES ' palace . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Beseech you , sir , were you present at this relation ? :
First Gentleman :
I was by at the opening of the fardel , heard the old :
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it : :
whereupon , after a little amazedness , we were all :
commanded out of the chamber ; only this methought I :
heard the shepherd say , he found the child . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I would most gladly know the issue of it . :
First Gentleman :
I make a broken delivery of the business ; but the :
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were :
very notes of admiration : they seemed almost , with :
",Florizel goes to the court of Sicily and introduces Perdita to Leontes. When the shepherds and Polixenes also arrive the whole thing begins to unravel with one revelation after another.
"eyes ; there was speech in their dumbness , language :
in their very gesture ; they looked as they had heard :
of a world ransomed , or one destroyed : a notable :
passion of wonder appeared in them ; but the wisest :
beholder , that knew no more but seeing , could not :
say if the importance were joy or sorrow ; but in the :
extremity of the one , it must needs be . :
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more . :
The news , Rogero ? :
Second Gentleman :
Nothing but bonfires : the oracle is fulfilled ; the :
king 's daughter is found : such a deal of wonder is :
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers :
cannot be able to express it . :
Here comes the Lady Paulina 's steward : he can :
deliver you more . How goes it now , sir ? this news :
which is called true is so like an old tale , that :
the verity of it is in strong suspicion : has the king :
found his heir ? :
Third Gentleman :
Most true , if ever truth were pregnant by :
circumstance : that which you hear you 'll swear you :
see , there is such unity in the proofs . The mantle :
of Queen Hermione 's , her jewel about the neck of it , :
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they :
know to be his character , the majesty of the :
creature in resemblance of the mother , the affection :
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding , :
and many other evidences proclaim her with all :
certainty to be the king 's daughter . Did you see :
the meeting of the two kings ? :
Second Gentleman :
No . :
Third Gentleman :
Then have you lost a sight , which was to be seen , :
cannot be spoken of . There might you have beheld one :
joy crown another , so and in such manner that it :
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them , for their :
joy waded in tears . There was casting up of eyes , :
holding up of hands , with countenances of such :
distraction that they were to be known by garment , :
not by favour . Our king , being ready to leap out of :
himself for joy of his found daughter , as if that :
joy were now become a loss , cries ' O , thy mother , :
thy mother ! ' then asks Bohemia forgiveness ; then :
embraces his son-in-law ; then again worries he his :
daughter with clipping her ; now he thanks the old :
shepherd , which stands by like a weather-bitten :
conduit of many kings ' reigns . I never heard of such :
another encounter , which lames report to follow it :
and undoes description to do it . :
Second Gentleman :
What , pray you , became of Antigonus , that carried :
hence the child ? :
Third Gentleman :
Like an old tale still , which will have matter to :
rehearse , though credit be asleep and not an ear :
open . He was torn to pieces with a bear : this :
avouches the shepherd 's son ; who has not only his :
innocence , which seems much , to justify him , but a :
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows . :
First Gentleman :
What became of his bark and his followers ? :
Third Gentleman :
Wrecked the same instant of their master 's death and :
in the view of the shepherd : so that all the :
instruments which aided to expose the child were :
even then lost when it was found . But O , the noble :
combat that ' twixt joy and sorrow was fought in :
Paulina ! She had one eye declined for the loss of :
her husband , another elevated that the oracle was :
fulfilled : she lifted the princess from the earth , :
and so locks her in embracing , as if she would pin :
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger :
of losing . :
First Gentleman :
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of :
","When Polixenes unexpectedly arrives, the warmth of his meeting with Leontes is described by a group of gentlemen, who report the unravelling of the whole history of Perdita."
"Third Gentleman :
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which :
angled for mine eyes , caught the water though not :
the fish , was when , at the relation of the queen 's :
death , with the manner how she came to 't bravely :
confessed and lamented by the king , how :
attentiveness wounded his daughter ; till , from one :
sign of dolour to another , she did , with an ' Alas , ' :
I would fain say , bleed tears , for I am sure my :
heart wept blood . Who was most marble there changed :
colour ; some swooned , all sorrowed : if all the world :
could have seen ' t , the woe had been universal . :
First Gentleman :
Are they returned to the court ? :
Third Gentleman :
No : the princess hearing of her mother 's statue , :
which is in the keeping of Paulina , --a piece many :
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare :
Italian master , Julio Romano , who , had he himself :
eternity and could put breath into his work , would :
beguile Nature of her custom , so perfectly he is her :
ape : he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that :
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of :
answer : thither with all greediness of affection :
are they gone , and there they intend to sup . :
Second Gentleman :
I thought she had some great matter there in hand ; :
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day , ever :
since the death of Hermione , visited that removed :
house . Shall we thither and with our company piece :
the rejoicing ? :
First Gentleman :
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access ? :
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born : :
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge . :
Let 's along . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Now , had I not the dash of my former life in me , :
would preferment drop on my head . I brought the old :
man and his son aboard the prince : told him I heard :
them talk of a fardel and I know not what : but he :
at that time , overfond of the shepherd 's daughter , :
so he then took her to be , who began to be much :
sea-sick , and himself little better , extremity of :
weather continuing , this mystery remained :
undiscovered . But ' tis all one to me ; for had I :
been the finder out of this secret , it would not :
have relished among my other discredits . :
Here come those I have done good to against my will , :
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune . :
Shepherd :
Come , boy ; I am past moe children , but thy sons and :
daughters will be all gentlemen born . :
Clown :
You are well met , sir . You denied to fight with me :
this other day , because I was no gentleman born . :
See you these clothes ? say you see them not and :
think me still no gentleman born : you were best say :
these robes are not gentlemen born : give me the :
lie , do , and try whether I am not now a gentleman born . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I know you are now , sir , a gentleman born . :
Clown :
Ay , and have been so any time these four hours . :
Shepherd :
And so have I , boy . :
Clown :
So you have : but I was a gentleman born before my :
father ; for the king 's son took me by the hand , and :
called me brother ; and then the two kings called my :
father brother ; and then the prince my brother and :
the princess my sister called my father father ; and :
so we wept , and there was the first gentleman-like :
tears that ever we shed . :
Shepherd :
We may live , son , to shed many more . :
Clown :
","A conversation takes place among several gentlemen and characters. They discuss recent events, including the revelation that the king's daughter has been found."
"preposterous estate as we are . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I humbly beseech you , sir , to pardon me all the :
faults I have committed to your worship and to give :
me your good report to the prince my master . :
Shepherd :
Prithee , son , do ; for we must be gentle , now we are :
gentlemen . :
Clown :
Thou wilt amend thy life ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Ay , an it like your good worship . :
Clown :
Give me thy hand : I will swear to the prince thou :
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia . :
Shepherd :
You may say it , but not swear it . :
Clown :
Not swear it , now I am a gentleman ? Let boors and :
franklins say it , I 'll swear it . :
Shepherd :
How if it be false , son ? :
Clown :
If it be ne 'er so false , a true gentleman may swear :
it in the behalf of his friend : and I 'll swear to :
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and :
that thou wilt not be drunk ; but I know thou art no :
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be :
drunk : but I 'll swear it , and I would thou wouldst :
be a tall fellow of thy hands . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I will prove so , sir , to my power . :
Clown :
Ay , by any means prove a tall fellow : if I do not :
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk , not :
being a tall fellow , trust me not . Hark ! the kings :
and the princes , our kindred , are going to see the :
queen 's picture . Come , follow us : we 'll be thy :
good masters . :
SCENE III . A chapel in PAULINA 'S house . :
LEONTES :
O grave and good Paulina , the great comfort :
That I have had of thee ! :
PAULINA :
What , sovereign sir , :
I did not well I meant well . All my services :
You have paid home : but that you have vouchsafed , :
With your crown 'd brother and these your contracted :
Heirs of your kingdoms , my poor house to visit , :
It is a surplus of your grace , which never :
My life may last to answer . :
LEONTES :
O Paulina , :
We honour you with trouble : but we came :
To see the statue of our queen : your gallery :
Have we pass 'd through , not without much content :
In many singularities ; but we saw not :
That which my daughter came to look upon , :
The statue of her mother . :
PAULINA :
As she lived peerless , :
So her dead likeness , I do well believe , :
Excels whatever yet you look 'd upon :
Or hand of man hath done ; therefore I keep it :
Lonely , apart . But here it is : prepare :
To see the life as lively mock 'd as ever :
Still sleep mock 'd death : behold , and say ' tis well . :
PAULINA draws a curtain , and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue :
I like your silence , it the more shows off :
Your wonder : but yet speak ; first , you , my liege , :
Comes it not something near ? :
LEONTES :
Her natural posture ! :
Chide me , dear stone , that I may say indeed :
Thou art Hermione ; or rather , thou art she :
In thy not chiding , for she was as tender :
As infancy and grace . But yet , Paulina , :
Hermione was not so much wrinkled , nothing :
So aged as this seems . :
POLIXENES :
O , not by much . :
PAULINA :
So much the more our carver 's excellence ; :
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her :
As she lived now . :
LEONTES :
As now she might have done , :
So much to my good comfort , as it is :
","Autolycus seeks forgiveness and a positive recommendation from the Shepherd and Clown. Later, Leontes and his group visit a chapel where Paulina unveils a lifelike statue of Hermione."
"Even with such life of majesty , warm life , :
As now it coldly stands , when first I woo 'd her ! :
I am ashamed : does not the stone rebuke me :
For being more stone than it ? O royal piece , :
There 's magic in thy majesty , which has :
My evils conjured to remembrance and :
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits , :
Standing like stone with thee . :
PERDITA :
And give me leave , :
And do not say ' tis superstition , that :
I kneel and then implore her blessing . Lady , :
Dear queen , that ended when I but began , :
Give me that hand of yours to kiss . :
PAULINA :
O , patience ! :
The statue is but newly fix 'd , the colour 's Not dry . :
CAMILLO :
My lord , your sorrow was too sore laid on , :
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away , :
So many summers dry ; scarce any joy :
Did ever so long live ; no sorrow :
But kill 'd itself much sooner . :
POLIXENES :
Dear my brother , :
Let him that was the cause of this have power :
To take off so much grief from you as he :
Will piece up in himself . :
PAULINA :
Indeed , my lord , :
If I had thought the sight of my poor image :
Would thus have wrought you , --for the stone is mine-- :
I 'ld not have show 'd it . :
LEONTES :
Do not draw the curtain . :
PAULINA :
No longer shall you gaze on 't , lest your fancy :
May think anon it moves . :
LEONTES :
Let be , let be . :
Would I were dead , but that , methinks , already-- :
What was he that did make it ? See , my lord , :
Would you not deem it breathed ? and that those veins :
Did verily bear blood ? :
POLIXENES :
Masterly done : :
The very life seems warm upon her lip . :
LEONTES :
The fixture of her eye has motion in 't , :
As we are mock 'd with art . :
PAULINA :
I 'll draw the curtain : :
My lord 's almost so far transported that :
He 'll think anon it lives . :
LEONTES :
O sweet Paulina , :
Make me to think so twenty years together ! :
No settled senses of the world can match :
The pleasure of that madness . Let ' t alone . :
PAULINA :
I am sorry , sir , I have thus far stirr 'd you : but :
I could afflict you farther . :
LEONTES :
Do , Paulina ; :
For this affliction has a taste as sweet :
As any cordial comfort . Still , methinks , :
There is an air comes from her : what fine chisel :
Could ever yet cut breath ? Let no man mock me , :
For I will kiss her . :
PAULINA :
Good my lord , forbear : :
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet ; :
You 'll mar it if you kiss it , stain your own :
With oily painting . Shall I draw the curtain ? :
LEONTES :
No , not these twenty years . :
PERDITA :
So long could I :
Stand by , a looker on . :
PAULINA :
Either forbear , :
Quit presently the chapel , or resolve you :
For more amazement . If you can behold it , :
I 'll make the statue move indeed , descend :
And take you by the hand ; but then you 'll think-- :
Which I protest against--I am assisted :
By wicked powers . :
LEONTES :
What you can make her do , :
I am content to look on : what to speak , :
I am content to hear ; for ' tis as easy :
To make her speak as move . :
PAULINA :
It is required :
You do awake your faith . Then all stand still ; :
On : those that think it is unlawful business :
I am about , let them depart . :
LEONTES :
Proceed : :
No foot shall stir . :
PAULINA :
",Paulina invites everyone to Hermione's tomb to view a remarkable sculpture of Hermione.
"Music :
'Tis time ; descend ; be stone no more ; approach ; :
Strike all that look upon with marvel . Come , :
I 'll fill your grave up : stir , nay , come away , :
Bequeath to death your numbness , for from him :
Dear life redeems you . You perceive she stirs : :
HERMIONE comes down :
Start not ; her actions shall be holy as :
You hear my spell is lawful : do not shun her :
Until you see her die again ; for then :
You kill her double . Nay , present your hand : :
When she was young you woo 'd her ; now in age :
Is she become the suitor ? :
LEONTES :
O , she 's warm ! :
If this be magic , let it be an art :
Lawful as eating . :
POLIXENES :
She embraces him . :
CAMILLO :
She hangs about his neck : :
If she pertain to life let her speak too . :
POLIXENES :
Ay , and make 't manifest where she has lived , :
Or how stolen from the dead . :
PAULINA :
That she is living , :
Were it but told you , should be hooted at :
Like an old tale : but it appears she lives , :
Though yet she speak not . Mark a little while . :
Please you to interpose , fair madam : kneel :
And pray your mother 's blessing . Turn , good lady ; :
Our Perdita is found . :
HERMIONE :
You gods , look down :
And from your sacred vials pour your graces :
Upon my daughter 's head ! Tell me , mine own . :
Where hast thou been preserved ? where lived ? how found :
Thy father 's court ? for thou shalt hear that I , :
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle :
Gave hope thou wast in being , have preserved :
Myself to see the issue . :
PAULINA :
There 's time enough for that ; :
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble :
Your joys with like relation . Go together , :
You precious winners all ; your exultation :
Partake to every one . I , an old turtle , :
Will wing me to some wither 'd bough and there :
My mate , that 's never to be found again , :
Lament till I am lost . :
LEONTES :
O , peace , Paulina ! :
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent , :
As I by thine a wife : this is a match , :
And made between 's by vows . Thou hast found mine ; :
But how , is to be question 'd ; for I saw her , :
As I thought , dead , and have in vain said many :
A prayer upon her grave . I 'll not seek far-- :
For him , I partly know his mind--to find thee :
An honourable husband . Come , Camillo , :
And take her by the hand , whose worth and honesty :
Is richly noted and here justified :
By us , a pair of kings . Let 's from this place . :
What ! look upon my brother : both your pardons , :
That e 'er I put between your holy looks :
My ill suspicion . This is your son-in-law , :
And son unto the king , who , heavens directing , :
Is troth-plight to your daughter . Good Paulina , :
Lead us from hence , where we may leisurely :
Each one demand an answer to his part :
Perform 'd in this wide gap of time since first :
","Paulina reveals she can make the statue move. When it does, it is shown to be Hermione, who had been hidden by Paulina until Leontes came to his senses. Perdita and Hermione are re-united."
"AEGEON : Proceed , Solinus , to procure my fall And by the doom of death end woes and all .
DUKE SOLINUS : Merchant of Syracuse , plead no more ; I am not partial to infringe our laws : The enmity and discord which of late Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke To merchants , our well-dealing countrymen , Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives Have seal 'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods , Excludes all pity from our threatening looks . For , since the mortal and intestine jars ' Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves , To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay , more , If any born at Ephesus be seen At any Syracusian marts and fairs ; Again : if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus , he dies , His goods confiscate to the duke 's dispose , Unless a thousand marks be levied , To quit the penalty and to ransom him . Thy substance , valued at the highest rate , Cannot amount unto a hundred marks ; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
AEGEON : Yet this my comfort : when your words are done , My woes end likewise with the evening sun .
DUKE SOLINUS : Well , Syracusian , say in brief the cause Why thou departed 'st from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus .
","A merchant named Egeon is arrested for entering the city of Ephesus, because the city is in open conflict with Egeon's home city of Syracuse. Because Egeon cannot afford the 1,000 marks fine, he is sentenced to death by Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus."
"DUKE SOLINUS : Nay , forward , old man ; do not break off so ; For we may pity , though not pardon thee .
AEGEON : O , had the gods done so , I had not now Worthily term 'd them merciless to us ! For , ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues , We were encounterd by a mighty rock ; Which being violently borne upon , Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst ; So that , in this unjust divorce of us , Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in , what to sorrow for . Her part , poor soul ! seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe , Was carried with more speed before the wind ; And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth , as we thought . At length , another ship had seized on us ; And , knowing whom it was their hap to save , Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck 'd guests ; And would have reft the fishers of their prey , Had not their bark been very slow of sail ; And therefore homeward did they bend their course . Thus have you heard me sever 'd from my bliss ; That by misfortunes was my life prolong 'd , To tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
DUKE SOLINUS : And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for , Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall 'n of them and thee till now .
AEGEON : My youngest boy , and yet my eldest care , At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother : and importuned me That his attendant--so his case was like , Reft of his brother , but retain 'd his name-- Might bear him company in the quest of him : Whom whilst I labour 'd of a love to see , I hazarded the loss of whom I loved . Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece , Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia , And , coasting homeward , came to Ephesus ; Hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men . But here must end the story of my life ; And happy were I in my timely death , Could all my travels warrant me they live .
DUKE SOLINUS : Hapless AEgeon , whom the fates have mark 'd To bear the extremity of dire mishap ! Now , trust me , were it not against our laws , Against my crown , my oath , my dignity , Which princes , would they , may not disannul , My soul would sue as advocate for thee . But , though thou art adjudged to the death And passed sentence may not be recall 'd But to our honour 's great disparagement , Yet I will favour thee in what I can . Therefore , merchant , I 'll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help : Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus ; Beg thou , or borrow , to make up the sum , And live ; if no , then thou art doom 'd to die . Gaoler , take him to thy custody .
Gaoler : I will , my lord .
AEGEON : Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend , But to procrastinate his lifeless end . Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse , DROMIO of Syracuse , and First Merchant
First Merchant : Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum , Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate . This very day a Syracusian merchant Is apprehended for arrival here ; And not being able to buy out his life According to the statute of the town , Dies ere the weary sun set in the west . There is your money that I had to keep . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Go bear it to the Centaur , where we host , And stay there , Dromio , till I come to thee . Within this hour it will be dinner-time : Till that , I 'll view the manners of the town , Peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , And then return and sleep within mine inn , For with long travel I am stiff and weary . Get thee away .
","Egeon then tells Solinus the tragic tale that brought him to the hostile city. He explains that he and his wife, Emilia, had identical twin sons. They named them both Antipholus and bought two identical slave boys, both named Dromio, to serve them. However, when they were still infants, a shipwreck separated the family. Egeon was rescued with one son and one servant and could only hope that the other son and servant survived with Emilia. When his Antipholus turned eighteen, he set out to search for his lost twin, and when he did not return, Egeon himself set out in search of them both. After many years of searching, he found himself in Ephesus where he was captured. Moved by Egeon's tale, Solinus allows him a day in which to find the money for the fine. "
"OF SYRACUSE : A trusty villain , sir , that very oft , When I am dull with care and melancholy , Lightens my humour with his merry jests . What , will you walk with me about the town , And then go to my inn and dine with me ?
First Merchant : I am invited , sir , to certain merchants , Of whom I hope to make much benefit ; I crave your pardon . Soon at five o 'clock , Please you , I 'll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bed-time : My present business calls me from you now . ANTIPHOLUS

First Merchant : Sir , I commend you to your own content . Exit ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get .

Enter DROMIO of Ephesus Here comes the almanac of my true date . What now ? how chance thou art return 'd so soon ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Return 'd so soon ! rather approach 'd too late : The capon burns , the pig falls from the spit , The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell ; My mistress made it one upon my cheek : She is so hot because the meat is cold ; The meat is cold because you come not home ; You come not home because you have no stomach ; You have no stomach having broke your fast ; But we that know what ' tis to fast and pray Are penitent for your default to-day . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Stop in your wind , sir : tell me this , I pray : Where have you left the money that I gave you ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : O , --sixpence , that I had o ' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ? The saddler had it , sir ; I kept it not . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I am not in a sportive humour now : Tell me , and dally not , where is the money ? We being strangers here , how darest thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I pray you , air , as you sit at dinner : I from my mistress come to you in post ; If I return , I shall be post indeed , For she will score your fault upon my pate . Methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , And strike you home without a messenger . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Come , Dromio , come , these jests are out of season ; Reserve them till a merrier hour than this . Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : To me , sir ? why , you gave no gold to me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house , the Phoenix , sir , to dinner : My mistress and her sister stays for you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : In what safe place you have bestow 'd my money , Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed : Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I have some marks of yours upon my pate , Some of my mistress ' marks upon my shoulders , But not a thousand marks between you both . If I should pay your worship those again , Perchance you will not bear them patiently . ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE : Upon my life , by some device or other The villain is o 'er-raught of all my money . They say this town is full of cozenage , As , nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind , Soul-killing witches that deform the body , Disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , And many such-like liberties of sin : If it prove so , I will be gone the sooner .

ADRIANA : Neither my husband nor the slave return 'd , That in such haste I sent to seek his master ! Sure , Luciana , it is two o 'clock .
LUCIANA : Perhaps some merchant hath invited him , And from the mart he 's somewhere gone to dinner . Good sister , let us dine and never fret : A man is master of his liberty : Time is their master , and , when they see time , They 'll go or come : if so , be patient , sister .
ADRIANA : Why should their liberty than ours be more ?
LUCIANA : Because their business still lies out o ' door .
ADRIANA : Look , when I serve him so , he takes it ill .
LUCIANA : O , know he is the bridle of your will .
ADRIANA : There 's none but asses will be bridled so .
LUCIANA : Why , headstrong liberty is lash 'd with woe . There 's nothing situate under heaven 's eye But hath his bound , in earth , in sea , in sky : The beasts , the fishes , and the winged fowls , Are their males ' subjects and at their controls : Men , more divine , the masters of all these , Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas , Indued with intellectual sense and souls , Of more preeminence than fish and fowls , Are masters to their females , and their lords : Then let your will attend on their accords .
ADRIANA : This servitude makes you to keep unwed .
LUCIANA : Not this , but troubles of the marriage-bed .
ADRIANA : But , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
LUCIANA : Ere I learn love , I 'll practise to obey .
ADRIANA : How if your husband start some other where ?
LUCIANA : Till he come home again , I would forbear .
ADRIANA : Patience unmoved ! no marvel though she pause ; They can be meek that have no other cause . A wretched soul , bruised with adversity , We bid be quiet when we hear it cry ; But were we burdened with like weight of pain , As much or more would we ourselves complain : So thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me , But , if thou live to see like right bereft , This fool-begg 'd patience in thee will be left .
LUCIANA : Well , I will marry one day , but to try . Here comes your man ; now is your husband nigh . Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
ADRIANA : Say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Nay , he 's at two hands with me , and that my two ears can witness .
ADRIANA : Say , didst thou speak with him ? know 'st thou his mind ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Ay , ay , he told his mind upon mine ear : Beshrew his hand , I scarce could understand it .
LUCIANA : Spake he so doubtfully , thou couldst not feel his meaning ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Nay , he struck so plainly , I could too well feel his blows ; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them .
","Antiopholus and servant Dromio of Syracuse are instantly mistaken by the townsfolk to be Antipholus and servant Dromio of Ephesus. Antipholus meets Dromio, who denies knowledge of money given to him earlier. Adriana, the wife of Antipholus sends Dromio to find his master. They encounter Antipholus and Dromio. When Dromio of Ephesus returns to home, he reports to Adriana, wife of Antipholus of Ephesus, that Antipholus beat him and denied being married to her."
"DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Why , mistress , sure my master is horn-mad .
ADRIANA : Horn-mad , thou villain !
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I mean not cuckold-mad ; But , sure , he is stark mad . When I desired him to come home to dinner , He ask 'd me for a thousand marks in gold : ' ' Tis dinner-time , ' quoth I ; ' My gold ! ' quoth he ; ' Your meat doth burn , ' quoth I ; ' My gold !

ADRIANA : His company must do his minions grace , Whilst I at home starve for a merry look .

If voluble and sharp discourse be marr 'd , Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard : Do their gay vestments his affections bait ? That 's not my fault : he 's master of my state : What ruins are in me that can be found , By him not ruin 'd ? then is he the ground Of my defeatures . My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair But , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale And feeds from home ; poor I am but his stale .
LUCIANA : Self-harming jealousy ! fie , beat it hence !
ADRIANA : Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense . I know his eye doth homage otherwhere , Or else what lets it but he would be here ? Sister , you know he promised me a chain ; Would that alone , alone he would detain , So he would keep fair quarter with his bed ! I see the jewel best enamelled Will lose his beauty ; yet the gold bides still , That others touch , and often touching will Wear gold : and no man that hath a name , By falsehood and corruption doth it shame .

When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport , But creep in crannies when he hides his beams . If you will jest with me , know my aspect , And fashion your demeanor to my looks , Or I will beat this method in your sconce .

How comes it now , my husband , O , how comes it , That thou art thus estranged from thyself ? Thyself I call it , being strange to me , That , undividable , incorporate , Am better than thy dear self 's better part . Ah , do not tear away thyself from me ! For know , my love , as easy mayest thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf , And take unmingled that same drop again , Without addition or diminishing , As take from me thyself and not me too . How dearly would it touch me to the quick , Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body , consecrate to thee , By ruffian lust should be contaminate ! Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the stain 'd skin off my harlot-brow And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring And break it with a deep-divorcing vow ? I know thou canst ; and therefore see thou do it . I am possess 'd with an adulterate blot ; My blood is mingled with the crime of lust : For if we too be one and thou play false , I do digest the poison of thy flesh , Being strumpeted by thy contagion . Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed ; I live unstain 'd , thou undishonoured . ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS : Go get thee gone ; fetch me an iron crow .
BALTHAZAR : Have patience , sir ; O , let it not be so ! Herein you war against your reputation And draw within the compass of suspect The unviolated honour of your wife . Once this , --your long experience of her wisdom , Her sober virtue , years and modesty , Plead on her part some cause to you unknown : And doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you . Be ruled by me : depart in patience , And let us to the Tiger all to dinner , And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint . If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day , A vulgar comment will be made of it , And that supposed by the common rout Against your yet ungalled estimation That may with foul intrusion enter in And dwell upon your grave when you are dead ; For slander lives upon succession , For ever housed where it gets possession . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : You have prevailed : I will depart in quiet , And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry . I know a wench of excellent discourse , Pretty and witty ; wild , and yet , too , gentle : There will we dine . This woman that I mean , My wife--but , I protest , without desert-- Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal : To her will we to dinner . To Angelo Get you home And fetch the chain ; by this I know ' tis made : Bring it , I pray you , to the Porpentine ; For there 's the house : that chain will I bestow-- Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-- Upon mine hostess there : good sir , make haste . Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me , I 'll knock elsewhere , to see if they 'll disdain me .
",Antipholus of Ephesus is furious and leaves to dine with a courtesan to spite his wife.
"OF EPHESUS : Do so . This jest shall cost me some expense . Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
LUCIANA : And may it be that you have quite forgot A husband 's office ? shall , Antipholus . Even in the spring of love , thy love-springs rot ? Shall love , in building , grow so ruinous ? If you did wed my sister for her wealth , Then for her wealth 's sake use her with more kindness : Or if you like elsewhere , do it by stealth ; Muffle your false love with some show of blindness : Let not my sister read it in your eye ; Be not thy tongue thy own shame 's orator ; Look sweet , be fair , become disloyalty ; Apparel vice like virtue 's harbinger ; Bear a fair presence , though your heart be tainted ; Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint ; Be secret-false : what need she be acquainted ? What simple thief brags of his own attaint ? ' Tis double wrong , to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board : Shame hath a bastard fame , well managed ; Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word . Alas , poor women ! make us but believe , Being compact of credit , that you love us ; Though others have the arm , show us the sleeve ; We in your motion turn and you may move us . Then , gentle brother , get you in again ; Comfort my sister , cheer her , call her wife : ' Tis holy sport to be a little vain , When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Sweet mistress--what your name is else , I know not , Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , -- Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth 's wonder , more than earth divine . Teach me , dear creature , how to think and speak ; Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit , Smother 'd in errors , feeble , shallow , weak , The folded meaning of your words ' deceit . Against my soul 's pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field ? Are you a god ? would you create me new ? Transform me then , and to your power I 'll yield . But if that I am I , then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine , Nor to her bed no homage do I owe Far more , far more to you do I decline . O , train me not , sweet mermaid , with thy note , To drown me in thy sister 's flood of tears : Sing , siren , for thyself and I will dote : Spread o 'er the silver waves thy golden hairs , And as a bed I 'll take them and there lie , And in that glorious supposition think He gains by death that hath such means to die : Let Love , being light , be drowned if she sink !
LUCIANA : What , are you mad , that you do reason so ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Not mad , but mated ; how , I do not know .
LUCIANA : It is a fault that springeth from your eye . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : For gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
LUCIANA : Gaze where you should , and that will clear your sight . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : As good to wink , sweet love , as look on night .
LUCIANA : Why call you me love ? call my sister so . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Thy sister 's sister .
LUCIANA : That 's my sister . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : No ; It is thyself , mine own self 's better part , Mine eye 's clear eye , my dear heart 's dearer heart , My food , my fortune and my sweet hope 's aim , My sole earth 's heaven and my heaven 's claim .
LUCIANA : All this my sister is , or else should be . ANTIPHOLUS
","Unaware of the events outside, Luciana tells Antipholus of Syracuse to be kinder to Adriana. However, Antipholus says that he does not care for Adriana but is deeply attracted to Luciana herself."

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Do you know me , sir ? am I Dromio ? am I your man ? am I myself ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I am an ass , I am a woman 's man and besides myself .

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , sir , besides myself , I am due to a woman ; one that claims me , one that haunts me , one that will have me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What claim lays she to thee ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry sir , such claim as you would lay to your horse ; and she would have me as a beast : not that , I being a beast , she would have me ; but that she , being a very beastly creature , lays claim to me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What is she ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : A very reverent body ; ay , such a one as a man may not speak of without he say ' Sir-reverence . ' I have but lean luck in the match , and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : How dost thou mean a fat marriage ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , sir , she 's the kitchen wench and all grease ; and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light . I warrant , her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter : if she lives till doomsday , she 'll burn a week longer than the whole world . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What complexion is she of ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Swart , like my shoe , but her face nothing half so clean kept : for why , she sweats ; a man may go over shoes in the grime of it . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : That 's a fault that water will mend .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No , sir , ' tis in grain ; Noah 's flood could not do it . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What 's her name ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Nell , sir ; but her name and three quarters , that 's an ell and three quarters , will not measure her from hip to hip . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Then she bears some breadth ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip : she is spherical , like a globe ; I could find out countries in her . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : In what part of her body stands Ireland ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , in her buttocks : I found it out by the bogs . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where Scotland ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I found it by the barrenness ; hard in the palm of the hand . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where France ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : In her forehead ; armed and reverted , making war against her heir . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where England ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I looked for the chalky cliffs , but I could find no whiteness in them ; but I guess it stood in her chin , by the salt rheum that ran between France and it . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where Spain ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Faith , I saw it not ; but I felt it hot in her breath . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where America , the Indies ?

ADRIANA : Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so ? Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest ? yea or no ? Look 'd he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ? What observation madest thou in this case Of his heart 's meteors tilting in his face ?
LUCIANA : First he denied you had in him no right .
ADRIANA : He meant he did me none ; the more my spite .
LUCIANA : Then swore he that he was a stranger here .
ADRIANA : And true he swore , though yet forsworn he were .
LUCIANA : Then pleaded I for you .
ADRIANA : And what said he ?
LUCIANA : That love I begg 'd for you he begg 'd of me .
ADRIANA : With what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
LUCIANA : With words that in an honest suit might move . First he did praise my beauty , then my speech .
ADRIANA : Didst speak him fair ?
LUCIANA : Have patience , I beseech .
ADRIANA : I cannot , nor I will not , hold me still ; My tongue , though not my heart , shall have his will . He is deformed , crooked , old and sere , Ill-faced , worse bodied , shapeless everywhere ; Vicious , ungentle , foolish , blunt , unkind ; Stigmatical in making , worse in mind .
LUCIANA : Who would be jealous then of such a one ? No evil lost is wail 'd when it is gone .
ADRIANA : Ah , but I think him better than I say , And yet would herein others ' eyes were worse . Far from her nest the lapwing cries away : My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse . Enter DROMIO of Syracuse

LUCIANA : How hast thou lost thy breath ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : By running fast .
ADRIANA : Where is thy master , Dromio ? is he well ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No , he 's in Tartar limbo , worse than hell . A devil in an everlasting garment hath him ; One whose hard heart is button 'd up with steel ; A fiend , a fury , pitiless and rough ; A wolf , nay , worse , a fellow all in buff ; A back-friend , a shoulder-clapper , one that countermands The passages of alleys , creeks and narrow lands ; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well ; One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell .
ADRIANA : Why , man , what is the matter ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I do not know the matter : he is ' rested on the case .
ADRIANA : What , is he arrested ? Tell me at whose suit .

OF SYRACUSE : I understand thee not .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No ? why , ' tis a plain case : he that went , like a bass-viol , in a case of leather ; the man , sir , that , when gentlemen are tired , gives them a sob and ' rests them ; he , sir , that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance ; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike .

OF SYRACUSE : Well , sir , there rest in your foolery . Is there any
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Why , sir , I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night ; and then were you hindered by the sergeant , to tarry for the hoy Delay . Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you . ANTIPHOLUS

Courtezan : Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner , Or , for my diamond , the chain you promised , And I 'll be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Some devils ask but the parings of one 's nail , A rush , a hair , a drop of blood , a pin , A nut , a cherry-stone ; But she , more covetous , would have a chain . Master , be wise : an if you give it her , The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it .

Courtezan : Now , out of doubt Antipholus is mad , Else would he never so demean himself . A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain : Both one and other he denies me now . The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner , Of his own doors being shut against his entrance . Belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , On purpose shut the doors against his way . My way is now to hie home to his house , And tell his wife that , being lunatic , He rush 'd into my house and took perforce My ring away .

DROMIO OF EPHESUS : In verity you did ; my bones bear witness , That since have felt the vigour of his rage .
ADRIANA : Is 't good to soothe him in these contraries ?
PINCH : It is no shame : the fellow finds his vein , And yielding to him humours well his frenzy . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Thou hast suborn 'd the goldsmith to arrest me .
ADRIANA : Alas , I sent you money to redeem you , By Dromio here , who came in haste for it .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Money by me ! heart and goodwill you might ; But surely master , not a rag of money . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Went 'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
ADRIANA : He came to me and I deliver 'd it .
LUCIANA : And I am witness with her that she did .
","Enraged, Antipholus flogs him. Adriana and Luciana enter, along with the courtesan and a schoolmaster called Doctor Pinch who attempts to exorcise Antipholus."
"PINCH : Mistress , both man and master is possess 'd ; I know it by their pale and deadly looks : They must be bound and laid in some dark room . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Say , wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day ? And why dost thou deny the bag of gold ?
ADRIANA : I did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : And , gentle master , I received no gold ; But I confess , sir , that we were lock 'd out .
ADRIANA : Dissembling villain , thou speak 'st false in both . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Dissembling harlot , thou art false in all ; And art confederate with a damned pack To make a loathsome abject scorn of me : But with these nails I 'll pluck out these false eyes That would behold in me this shameful sport . Enter three or four , and offer to bind him . He strives
ADRIANA : O , bind him , bind him ! let him not come near me .
PINCH : More company ! The fiend is strong within him .
LUCIANA : Ay me , poor man , how pale and wan he looks ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : What , will you murder me ? Thou gaoler , thou , I am thy prisoner : wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue ?
Officer : Masters , let him go He is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
PINCH : Go bind this man , for he is frantic too . They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus
ADRIANA : What wilt thou do , thou peevish officer ? Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself ?
Officer : He is my prisoner : if I let him go , The debt he owes will be required of me .
ADRIANA : I will discharge thee ere I go from thee : Bear me forthwith unto his creditor , And , knowing how the debt grows , I will pay it . Good master doctor , see him safe convey 'd Home to my house . O most unhappy day ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : O most unhappy strumpet !
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Master , I am here entered in bond for you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Out on thee , villain ! wherefore dost thou mad me ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Will you be bound for nothing ? be mad , good master : cry ' The devil ! '
LUCIANA : God help , poor souls , how idly do they talk !
ADRIANA : Go bear him hence . Sister , go you with me . Say now , whose suit is he arrested at ?
Officer : One Angelo , a goldsmith : do you know him ?
ADRIANA : I know the man . What is the sum he owes ?
Officer : Two hundred ducats .
ADRIANA : Say , how grows it due ?
Officer : Due for a chain your husband had of him .
ADRIANA : He did bespeak a chain for me , but had it not .
Courtezan : When as your husband all in rage to-day Came to my house and took away my ring-- The ring I saw upon his finger now-- Straight after did I meet him with a chain .
ADRIANA : It may be so , but I did never see it . Come , gaoler , bring me where the goldsmith is : I long to know the truth hereof at large . Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn , and DROMIO of Syracuse
LUCIANA : God , for thy mercy ! they are loose again .
ADRIANA : And come with naked swords . Let 's call more help to have them bound again .
Officer : Away ! they 'll kill us . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I see these witches are afraid of swords .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : She that would be your wife now ran from you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Come to the Centaur ; fetch our stuff from thence : I long that we were safe and sound aboard .
","The attempt is unsuccessful but, when Adriana promises to clear her husband's debts, Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus are tied up and led away to her home."
"OF SYRACUSE : I will not stay to-night for all the town ; Therefore away , to get our stuff aboard . Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO
ANGELO : I am sorry , sir , that I have hinder 'd you ; But , I protest , he had the chain of me , Though most dishonestly he doth deny it .
Second Merchant : How is the man esteemed here in the city ?
ANGELO : Of very reverend reputation , sir , Of credit infinite , highly beloved , Second to none that lives here in the city : His word might bear my wealth at any time .
Second Merchant : Speak softly ; yonder , as I think , he walks . Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
ANGELO : ' Tis so ; and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have . Good sir , draw near to me , I 'll speak to him . Signior Antipholus , I wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble ; And , not without some scandal to yourself , With circumstance and oaths so to deny This chain which now you wear so openly : Beside the charge , the shame , imprisonment , You have done wrong to this my honest friend , Who , but for staying on our controversy , Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day : This chain you had of me ; can you deny it ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I think I had ; I never did deny it .
Second Merchant : Yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
Second Merchant : These ears of mine , thou know 'st did hear thee . Fie on thee , wretch ! ' tis pity that thou livest To walk where any honest man resort . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Thou art a villain to impeach me thus : I 'll prove mine honour and mine honesty Against thee presently , if thou darest stand .
Second Merchant : I dare , and do defy thee for a villain . They draw Enter ADRIANA , LUCIANA , the Courtezan , and others
ADRIANA : Hold , hurt him not , for God 's sake ! he is mad . Some get within him , take his sword away : Bind Dromio too , and bear them to my house .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Run , master , run ; for God 's sake , take a house ! This is some priory . In , or we are spoil 'd ! Enter the Lady Abbess , AEMILIA
AEMELIA : Be quiet , people . Wherefore throng you hither ?
ADRIANA : To fetch my poor distracted husband hence . Let us come in , that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery .
ANGELO : I knew he was not in his perfect wits .
Second Merchant : I am sorry now that I did draw on him .
AEMELIA : How long hath this possession held the man ?
ADRIANA : This week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , And much different from the man he was ; But till this afternoon his passion Ne 'er brake into extremity of rage .
AEMELIA : Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea ? Buried some dear friend ? Hath not else his eye Stray 'd his affection in unlawful love ? A sin prevailing much in youthful men , Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing . Which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
ADRIANA : To none of these , except it be the last ; Namely , some love that drew him oft from home .
AEMELIA : You should for that have reprehended him .
ADRIANA : Why , so I did .
AEMELIA : Ay , but not rough enough .
ADRIANA : As roughly as my modesty would let me .
AEMELIA : Haply , in private .
ADRIANA : And in assemblies too .
AEMELIA : Ay , but not enough .
","Adriana and the others then immediately meet Antipholus and Dromio with swords drawn, and, confused by their sudden liberty, flee from them.  Angelo meets Antipholus, sees the chain, and prepares to fight him."
"AEMELIA : And thereof came it that the man was mad . The venom clamours of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog 's tooth . It seems his sleeps were hinder 'd by thy railing , And therefore comes it that his head is light . Thou say 'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings : Unquiet meals make ill digestions ; Thereof the raging fire of fever bred ; And what 's a fever but a fit of madness ? Thou say 'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls : Sweet recreation barr 'd , what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy , Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair , And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life ? In food , in sport and life-preserving rest To be disturb 'd , would mad or man or beast : The consequence is then thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
LUCIANA : She never reprehended him but mildly , When he demean 'd himself rough , rude and wildly . Why bear you these rebukes and answer not ?
ADRIANA : She did betray me to my own reproof . Good people enter and lay hold on him .
AEMELIA : No , not a creature enters in my house .
ADRIANA : Then let your servants bring my husband forth .
AEMELIA : Neither : he took this place for sanctuary , And it shall privilege him from your hands Till I have brought him to his wits again , Or lose my labour in assaying it .
ADRIANA : I will attend my husband , be his nurse , Diet his sickness , for it is my office , And will have no attorney but myself ; And therefore let me have him home with me .
AEMELIA : Be patient ; for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approved means I have , With wholesome syrups , drugs and holy prayers , To make of him a formal man again : It is a branch and parcel of mine oath , A charitable duty of my order . Therefore depart and leave him here with me .
ADRIANA : I will not hence and leave my husband here : And ill it doth beseem your holiness To separate the husband and the wife .
AEMELIA : Be quiet and depart : thou shalt not have him . Exit
LUCIANA : Complain unto the duke of this indignity .
ADRIANA : Come , go : I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the abbess .
Second Merchant : By this , I think , the dial points at five : Anon , I 'm sure , the duke himself in person Comes this way to the melancholy vale , The place of death and sorry execution , Behind the ditches of the abbey here .
ANGELO : Upon what cause ?
Second Merchant : To see a reverend Syracusian merchant , Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town , Beheaded publicly for his offence .
ANGELO : See where they come : we will behold his death .
LUCIANA : Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey . Enter DUKE SOLINUS , attended ; AEGEON bareheaded ; with the Headsman and other Officers
DUKE SOLINUS : Yet once again proclaim it publicly , If any friend will pay the sum for him , He shall not die ; so much we tender him .
ADRIANA : Justice , most sacred duke , against the abbess !
DUKE SOLINUS : She is a virtuous and a reverend lady : It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong .
","On the arrival of Adriana and the others, Antipholus and Dormio run into a priory for safety. The abbess Aemilia discusses his supposed madness with Adriana, but refuses to let her enter the priory. Adriana decides to complain to the Duke, who is nearby for Egeon's execution, to get to see her supposed husband."
"DUKE SOLINUS : Long since thy husband served me in my wars , And I to thee engaged a prince 's word , When thou didst make him master of thy bed , To do him all the grace and good I could . Go , some of you , knock at the abbey-gate And bid the lady abbess come to me . I will determine this before I stir . Enter a Servant
Servant : O mistress , mistress , shift and save yourself ! My master and his man are both broke loose , Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire ; And ever , as it blazed , they threw on him Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair : My master preaches patience to him and the while His man with scissors nicks him like a fool , And sure , unless you send some present help , Between them they will kill the conjurer .
ADRIANA : Peace , fool ! thy master and his man are here , And that is false thou dost report to us .
Servant : Mistress , upon my life , I tell you true ; I have not breathed almost since I did see it . He cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , To scorch your face and to disfigure you . Cry within Hark , hark ! I hear him , mistress. fly , be gone !
DUKE SOLINUS : Come , stand by me ; fear nothing . Guard with halberds !
ADRIANA : Ay me , it is my husband ! Witness you , That he is borne about invisible : Even now we housed him in the abbey here ; And now he 's there , past thought of human reason . Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Justice , most gracious duke , O , grant me justice ! Even for the service that long since I did thee , When I bestrid thee in the wars and took Deep scars to save thy life ; even for the blood That then I lost for thee , now grant me justice .
AEGEON : Unless the fear of death doth make me dote , I see my son Antipholus and Dromio . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Justice , sweet prince , against that woman there ! She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife , That hath abused and dishonour 'd me Even in the strength and height of injury ! Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
DUKE SOLINUS : Discover how , and thou shalt find me just . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : This day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me , While she with harlots feasted in my house .
DUKE SOLINUS : A grievous fault ! Say , woman , didst thou so ?
ADRIANA : No , my good lord : myself , he and my sister To-day did dine together . So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal !
LUCIANA : Ne 'er may I look on day , nor sleep on night , But she tells to your highness simple truth !
ANGELO : O perjured woman ! They are both forsworn : In this the madman justly chargeth them . ANTIPHOLUS
","However, after a messenger announces that he has escaped, Antipholus of Ephesus himself enters and begs the Duke for help. All parties tell what has happened from their own point of view. Egeon sees him and believes he is Antipholus of Syracuse."
"ANGELO : My lord , in truth , thus far I witness with him , That he dined not at home , but was lock 'd out .
DUKE SOLINUS : But had he such a chain of thee or no ?
ANGELO : He had , my lord : and when he ran in here , These people saw the chain about his neck .
Second Merchant : Besides , I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart : And thereupon I drew my sword on you ; And then you fled into this abbey here , From whence , I think , you are come by miracle . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I never came within these abbey-walls , Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me : I never saw the chain , so help me Heaven ! And this is false you burden me withal .
DUKE SOLINUS : Why , what an intricate impeach is this ! I think you all have drunk of Circe 's cup . If here you housed him , here he would have been ; If he were mad , he would not plead so coldly : You say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here Denies that saying . Sirrah , what say you ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Sir , he dined with her there , at the Porpentine .
Courtezan : He did , and from my finger snatch 'd that ring . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : ' Tis true , my liege ; this ring I had of her .
DUKE SOLINUS : Saw 'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?
Courtezan : As sure , my liege , as I do see your grace .
DUKE SOLINUS : Why , this is strange . Go call the abbess hither . I think you are all mated or stark mad . Exit one to Abbess
AEGEON : Most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word : Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me .
DUKE SOLINUS : Speak freely , Syracusian , what thou wilt .
AEGEON : Is not your name , sir , call 'd Antipholus ? And is not that your bondman , Dromio ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Within this hour I was his bondman sir , But he , I thank him , gnaw 'd in two my cords : Now am I Dromio and his man unbound .
AEGEON : I am sure you both of you remember me .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Ourselves we do remember , sir , by you ; For lately we were bound , as you are now You are not Pinch 's patient , are you , sir ?
AEGEON : Why look you strange on me ? you know me well .
ANTIPHOLUS : I never saw you in my life till now .
AEGEON : O , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , And careful hours with time 's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face : But tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Neither .
AEGEON : Dromio , nor thou ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : No , trust me , sir , nor I.
AEGEON : I am sure thou dost .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Ay , sir , but I am sure I do not ; and whatsoever a man denies , you are now bound to believe him .
AEGEON : Not know my voice ! O time 's extremity , Hast thou so crack 'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years , that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ? Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter 's drizzled snow , And all the conduits of my blood froze up , Yet hath my night of life some memory , My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , My dull deaf ears a little use to hear : All these old witnesses--I cannot err-- Tell me thou art my son Antipholus . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I never saw my father in my life .
",Antipholus says he has never seen Egeon before.
"OF EPHESUS : The duke and all that know me in the city Can witness with me that it is not so I ne 'er saw Syracusa in my life .
DUKE SOLINUS : I tell thee , Syracusian , twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus , During which time he ne 'er saw Syracusa : I see thy age and dangers make thee dote . Re-enter AEMILIA , with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
AEMELIA : Most mighty duke , behold a man much wrong 'd . All gather to see them
ADRIANA : I see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
DUKE SOLINUS : One of these men is Genius to the other ; And so of these . Which is the natural man , And which the spirit ? who deciphers them ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I , sir , am Dromio ; command him away .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I , sir , am Dromio ; pray , let me stay . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : AEgeon art thou not ? or else his ghost ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : O , my old master ! who hath bound him here ?
AEMELIA : Whoever bound him , I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty . Speak , old AEgeon , if thou be 'st the man That hadst a wife once call 'd AEmilia That bore thee at a burden two fair sons : O , if thou be 'st the same AEgeon , speak , And speak unto the same AEmilia !
AEGEON : If I dream not , thou art AEmilia : If thou art she , tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
AEMELIA : By men of Epidamnum he and I And the twin Dromio all were taken up ; But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them And me they left with those of Epidamnum . What then became of them I cannot tell I to this fortune that you see me in .
DUKE SOLINUS : Why , here begins his morning story right ; These two Antipholuses , these two so like , And these two Dromios , one in semblance , -- Besides her urging of her wreck at sea , -- These are the parents to these children , Which accidentally are met together . Antipholus , thou camest from Corinth first ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : No , sir , not I ; I came from Syracuse .
DUKE SOLINUS : Stay , stand apart ; I know not which is which . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I came from Corinth , my most gracious lord , --
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : And I with him . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Brought to this town by that most famous warrior , Duke Menaphon , your most renowned uncle .
ADRIANA : Which of you two did dine with me to-day ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I , gentle mistress .
ADRIANA : And are not you my husband ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : No ; I say nay to that . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : And so do I ; yet did she call me so : And this fair gentlewoman , her sister here , Did call me brother . To Luciana What I told you then , I hope I shall have leisure to make good ; If this be not a dream I see and hear .
ANGELO : That is the chain , sir , which you had of me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I think it be , sir ; I deny it not . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : And you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
ANGELO : I think I did , sir ; I deny it not .
ADRIANA : I sent you money , sir , to be your bail , By Dromio ; but I think he brought it not .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : No , none by me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio , my man , did bring them me . I see we still did meet each other 's man , And I was ta 'en for him , and he for me , And thereupon these errors are arose . ANTIPHOLUS
","The abbess enters with Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse and events become clear. Both pairs of twins are reunited, the Abbess reveals that she is, in fact, Emilia, and the Duke pardons Egeon."
"DUKE SOLINUS : It shall not need ; thy father hath his life .
Courtezan : Sir , I must have that diamond from you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : There , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
AEMELIA : Renowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes : And all that are assembled in this place , That by this sympathized one day 's error Have suffer 'd wrong , go keep us company , And we shall make full satisfaction . Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you , my sons ; and till this present hour My heavy burden ne 'er delivered . The duke , my husband and my children both , And you the calendars of their nativity , Go to a gossips ' feast and go with me ; After so long grief , such festivity !
DUKE SOLINUS : With all my heart , I 'll gossip at this feast. of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Master , shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embark 'd ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Your goods that lay at host , sir , in the Centaur . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : He speaks to me . I am your master , Dromio : Come , go with us ; we 'll look to that anon : Embrace thy brother there ; rejoice with him .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : There is a fat friend at your master 's house , That kitchen 'd me for you to-day at dinner : She now shall be my sister , not my wife .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Methinks you are my glass , and not my brother : I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth . Will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Not I , sir ; you are my elder .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : That 's a question : how shall we try it ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : We 'll draw cuts for the senior : till then lead thou first .

DUNCAN : What bloody man is that ? He can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the revolt The newest state .
MALCOLM : This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought ' Gainst my captivity . Hail , brave friend ! Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it .
Sergeant : Doubtful it stood ; As two spent swimmers , that do cling together And choke their art . The merciless Macdonwald-- Worthy to be a rebel , for to that The multiplying villanies of nature Do swarm upon him--from the western isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied ; And fortune , on his damned quarrel smiling , Show 'd like a rebel 's whore : but all 's too weak : For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name-- Disdaining fortune , with his brandish 'd steel , Which smoked with bloody execution , Like valour 's minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave ; Which ne 'er shook hands , nor bade farewell to him , Till he unseam 'd him from the nave to the chaps , And fix 'd his head upon our battlements .
DUNCAN : O valiant cousin ! worthy gentleman !
Sergeant : As whence the sun ' gins his reflection Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break , So from that spring whence comfort seem 'd to come Discomfort swells . Mark , king of Scotland , mark : No sooner justice had with valour arm 'd Compell 'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels , But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage , With furbish 'd arms and new supplies of men Began a fresh assault .
DUNCAN : Dismay 'd not this Our captains , Macbeth and Banquo ?
Sergeant : Yes ; As sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion . If I say sooth , I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks , so they Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe : Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds , Or memorise another Golgotha , I cannot tell . But I am faint , my gashes cry for help .
DUNCAN : So well thy words become thee as thy wounds ; They smack of honour both . Go get him surgeons . Exit Sergeant , attended Who comes here ? Enter ROSS
MALCOLM : The worthy thane of Ross .
LENNOX : What a haste looks through his eyes ! So should he look That seems to speak things strange .
ROSS : God save the king !
DUNCAN : Whence camest thou , worthy thane ?
ROSS : From Fife , great king ; Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold . Norway himself , With terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyal traitor The thane of Cawdor , began a dismal conflict ; Till that Bellona 's bridegroom , lapp 'd in proof , Confronted him with self-comparisons , Point against point rebellious , arm ' gainst arm . Curbing his lavish spirit : and , to conclude , The victory fell on us .
DUNCAN : Great happiness !
ROSS : That now Sweno , the Norways ' king , craves composition : Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme 's inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use .
DUNCAN : No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest : go pronounce his present death , And with his former title greet Macbeth .
ROSS : I 'll see it done .
DUNCAN : What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won . Thunder . Enter the three Witches
",Three witches anticipate a meeting with Macbeth. King Duncan hears a report of how his generals Macbeth and Banquo defeated the Norwegians and the Scottish rebels. The witches gather on a heath and meet the generals returning from the war.
"Second Witch : Killing swine .
Third Witch : Sister , where thou ?
First Witch : A sailor 's wife had chestnuts in her lap , And munch 'd , and munch 'd , and munch 'd : -- ' Give me , ' quoth I : ' Aroint thee , witch ! ' the rump-fed ronyon cries . Her husband 's to Aleppo gone , master o ' the Tiger : But in a sieve I 'll thither sail , And , like a rat without a tail , I 'll do , I 'll do , and I 'll do .
Second Witch : I 'll give thee a wind .
First Witch : Thou 'rt kind .
Third Witch : And I another .
First Witch : I myself have all the other , And the very ports they blow , All the quarters that they know I ' the shipman 's card . I will drain him dry as hay : Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his pent-house lid ; He shall live a man forbid : Weary se 'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle , peak and pine : Though his bark cannot be lost , Yet it shall be tempest-tost .

MACBETH : So foul and fair a day I have not seen .
BANQUO : How far is 't call 'd to Forres ? What are these So wither 'd and so wild in their attire , That look not like the inhabitants o ' the earth , And yet are on 't ? Live you ? or are you aught That man may question ? You seem to understand me , By each at once her chappy finger laying Upon her skinny lips : you should be women , And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so .
MACBETH : Speak , if you can : what are you ?
First Witch : All hail , Macbeth ! hail to thee , thane of Glamis !
Second Witch : All hail , Macbeth , hail to thee , thane of Cawdor !
Third Witch : All hail , Macbeth , thou shalt be king hereafter !
BANQUO : Good sir , why do you start ; and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair ? I ' the name of truth , Are ye fantastical , or that indeed Which outwardly ye show ? My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope , That he seems rapt withal : to me you speak not . If you can look into the seeds of time , And say which grain will grow and which will not , Speak then to me , who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate .
First Witch : Hail !
Second Witch : Hail !
Third Witch : Hail !
First Witch : Lesser than Macbeth , and greater .
Second Witch : Not so happy , yet much happier .
Third Witch : Thou shalt get kings , though thou be none : So all hail , Macbeth and Banquo !
First Witch : Banquo and Macbeth , all hail !
MACBETH : Stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more : By Sinel 's death I know I am thane of Glamis ; But how of Cawdor ? the thane of Cawdor lives , A prosperous gentleman ; and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief , No more than to be Cawdor . Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence ? or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting ? Speak , I charge you . Witches vanish
BANQUO : The earth hath bubbles , as the water has , And these are of them . Whither are they vanish 'd ?
","After the battle, Macbeth and his friend Banquo come upon the weird sisters, three witches who prophesy that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and one day King."
"BANQUO : Were such things here as we do speak about ? Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner ?
MACBETH : Your children shall be kings .
BANQUO : You shall be king .
MACBETH : And thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ?
BANQUO : To the selfsame tune and words . Who 's here ? Enter ROSS and ANGUS
ROSS : The king hath happily received , Macbeth , The news of thy success ; and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels ' fight , His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his : silenced with that , In viewing o 'er the rest o ' the selfsame day , He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks , Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , Strange images of death . As thick as hail Came post with post ; and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom 's great defence , And pour 'd them down before him .
ANGUS : We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks ; Only to herald thee into his sight , Not pay thee .
ROSS : And , for an earnest of a greater honour , He bade me , from him , call thee thane of Cawdor : In which addition , hail , most worthy thane ! For it is thine .
BANQUO : What , can the devil speak true ?
MACBETH : The thane of Cawdor lives : why do you dress me In borrow 'd robes ?
ANGUS : Who was the thane lives yet ; But under heavy judgment bears that life Which he deserves to lose . Whether he was combined With those of Norway , or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage , or that with both He labour 'd in his country 's wreck , I know not ; But treasons capital , confess 'd and proved , Have overthrown him .
MACBETH : Glamis , and thane of Cawdor ! The greatest is behind . To ROSS and ANGUS Thanks for your pains . To BANQUO Do you not hope your children shall be kings , When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them ?
BANQUO : That trusted home Might yet enkindle you unto the crown , Besides the thane of Cawdor . But ' tis strange : And oftentimes , to win us to our harm , The instruments of darkness tell us truths , Win us with honest trifles , to betray 's In deepest consequence . Cousins , a word , I pray you .
MACBETH : Two truths are told , As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme.--I thank you , gentlemen . Aside Cannot be ill , cannot be good : if ill , Why hath it given me earnest of success , Commencing in a truth ? I am thane of Cawdor : If good , why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs , Against the use of nature ? Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings : My thought , whose murder yet is but fantastical , Shakes so my single state of man that function Is smother 'd in surmise , and nothing is But what is not .
BANQUO : Look , how our partner 's rapt .
MACBETH : If chance will have me king , why , chance may crown me , Without my stir .
BANQUO : New horrors come upon him , Like our strange garments , cleave not to their mould But with the aid of use .
MACBETH : Come what come may , Time and the hour runs through the roughest day .
BANQUO : Worthy Macbeth , we stay upon your leisure .
MACBETH : Give me your favour : my dull brain was wrought With things forgotten . Kind gentlemen , your pains Are register 'd where every day I turn The leaf to read them . Let us toward the king . Think upon what hath chanced , and , at more time , The interim having weigh 'd it , let us speak Our free hearts each to other .
BANQUO : Very gladly .
","They further prophesy that Banquo's descendants will be kings. The men don't at first believe the witches, but then learn that the old Thane of Cawdor was actually a traitor helping the Norwegians, and that Duncan has rewarded Macbeth's bravery on the battlefield by making him Thane of Cawdor."
"DUNCAN : Is execution done on Cawdor ? Are not Those in commission yet return 'd ?
MALCOLM : My liege , They are not yet come back . But I have spoke With one that saw him die : who did report That very frankly he confess 'd his treasons , Implored your highness ' pardon and set forth A deep repentance : nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it ; he died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed , As ' twere a careless trifle .
DUNCAN : There 's no art To find the mind 's construction in the face : He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust . Enter MACBETH , BANQUO , ROSS , and ANGUS O worthiest cousin ! The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me : thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee . Would thou hadst less deserved , That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine ! only I have left to say , More is thy due than more than all can pay .
MACBETH : The service and the loyalty I owe , In doing it , pays itself . Your highness ' part Is to receive our duties ; and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants , Which do but what they should , by doing every thing Safe toward your love and honour .
DUNCAN : Welcome hither : I have begun to plant thee , and will labour To make thee full of growing . Noble Banquo , That hast no less deserved , nor must be known No less to have done so , let me enfold thee And hold thee to my heart .
BANQUO : There if I grow , The harvest is your own .
DUNCAN : My plenteous joys , Wanton in fulness , seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow . Sons , kinsmen , thanes , And you whose places are the nearest , know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest , Malcolm , whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland ; which honour must Not unaccompanied invest him only , But signs of nobleness , like stars , shall shine On all deservers . From hence to Inverness , And bind us further to you .
MACBETH : The rest is labour , which is not used for you : I 'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach ; So humbly take my leave .
DUNCAN : My worthy Cawdor !
MACBETH : The Prince of Cumberland ! that is a step On which I must fall down , or else o 'erleap , For in my way it lies . Stars , hide your fires ; Let not light see my black and deep desires : The eye wink at the hand ; yet let that be , Which the eye fears , when it is done , to see . Exit
DUNCAN : True , worthy Banquo ; he is full so valiant , And in his commendations I am fed ; It is a banquet to me . Let 's after him , Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome : It is a peerless kinsman . Enter LADY MACBETH , reading a letter
","Macbeth immediately fantasizes about murdering Duncan and becoming king, but pushes the thought away. Later that day, Duncan announces that his eldest son, Malcolm, will be heir to his throne. As Macbeth begins to succumb to his ambition, Duncan decides to spend the night in celebration at Macbeth's castle of Inverness."
"Messenger : The king comes here to-night .
LADY MACBETH : Thou 'rt mad to say it : Is not thy master with him ? who , were 't so , Would have inform 'd for preparation .
Messenger : So please you , it is true : our thane is coming : One of my fellows had the speed of him , Who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Than would make up his message .
LADY MACBETH : Give him tending ; He brings great news . Exit Messenger The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements . Come , you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts , unsex me here , And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty ! make thick my blood ; Stop up the access and passage to remorse , That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keep peace between The effect and it ! Come to my woman 's breasts , And take my milk for gall , you murdering ministers , Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature 's mischief ! Come , thick night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell , That my keen knife see not the wound it makes , Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark , To cry ' Hold , hold ! ' Enter MACBETH Great Glamis ! worthy Cawdor ! Greater than both , by the all-hail hereafter ! Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present , and I feel now The future in the instant .
MACBETH : My dearest love , Duncan comes here to-night .
LADY MACBETH : And when goes hence ?
MACBETH : To-morrow , as he purposes .
LADY MACBETH : O , never Shall sun that morrow see ! Your face , my thane , is as a book where men May read strange matters . To beguile the time , Look like the time ; bear welcome in your eye , Your hand , your tongue : look like the innocent flower , But be the serpent under 't . He that 's coming Must be provided for : and you shall put This night 's great business into my dispatch ; Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom .
MACBETH : We will speak further .
LADY MACBETH : Only look up clear ; To alter favour ever is to fear : Leave all the rest to me . Hautboys and torches . Enter DUNCAN , MALCOLM , DONALBAIN , BANQUO , LENNOX , MACDUFF , ROSS , ANGUS , and Attendants
DUNCAN : This castle hath a pleasant seat ; the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses .
BANQUO : This guest of summer , The temple-haunting martlet , does approve , By his loved mansionry , that the heaven 's breath Smells wooingly here : no jutty , frieze , Buttress , nor coign of vantage , but this bird Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle : Where they most breed and haunt , I have observed , The air is delicate . Enter LADY MACBETH
DUNCAN : See , see , our honour 'd hostess ! The love that follows us sometime is our trouble , Which still we thank as love . Herein I teach you How you shall bid God ' ild us for your pains , And thank us for your trouble .
LADY MACBETH : All our service In every point twice done and then done double Were poor and single business to contend Against those honours deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house : for those of old , And the late dignities heap 'd up to them , We rest your hermits .
DUNCAN : Where 's the thane of Cawdor ? We coursed him at the heels , and had a purpose To be his purveyor : but he rides well ; And his great love , sharp as his spur , hath holp him To his home before us . Fair and noble hostess , We are your guest to-night .
LADY MACBETH : Your servants ever Have theirs , themselves and what is theirs , in compt , To make their audit at your highness ' pleasure , Still to return your own .
",Lady Macbeth receives news from her husband of the prophecy and his new title and she vows to help him become king by any means she can. Macbeth's return is followed almost at once by Duncan's arrival.
"MACBETH : If it were done when ' tis done , then ' twere well It were done quickly : if the assassination Could trammel up the consequence , and catch With his surcease success ; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all here , But here , upon this bank and shoal of time , We 'ld jump the life to come . But in these cases We still have judgment here ; that we but teach Bloody instructions , which , being taught , return To plague the inventor : this even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison 'd chalice To our own lips . He 's here in double trust ; First , as I am his kinsman and his subject , Strong both against the deed ; then , as his host , Who should against his murderer shut the door , Not bear the knife myself . Besides , this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek , hath been So clear in his great office , that his virtues Will plead like angels , trumpet-tongued , against The deep damnation of his taking-off ; And pity , like a naked new-born babe , Striding the blast , or heaven 's cherubim , horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air , Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye , That tears shall drown the wind . I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent , but only Vaulting ambition , which o 'erleaps itself And falls on the other . Enter LADY MACBETH How now ! what news ?
LADY MACBETH : He has almost supp 'd : why have you left the chamber ?
MACBETH : Hath he ask 'd for me ?
LADY MACBETH : Know you not he has ?
MACBETH : We will proceed no further in this business : He hath honour 'd me of late ; and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worn now in their newest gloss , Not cast aside so soon .
LADY MACBETH : Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress 'd yourself ? hath it slept since ? And wakes it now , to look so green and pale At what it did so freely ? From this time Such I account thy love . Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valour As thou art in desire ? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem 'st the ornament of life , And live a coward in thine own esteem , Letting ' I dare not ' wait upon ' I would , ' Like the poor cat i ' the adage ?
MACBETH : Prithee , peace : I dare do all that may become a man ; Who dares do more is none .
LADY MACBETH : What beast was 't , then , That made you break this enterprise to me ? When you durst do it , then you were a man ; And , to be more than what you were , you would Be so much more the man . Nor time nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both : They have made themselves , and that their fitness now Does unmake you . I have given suck , and know How tender ' tis to love the babe that milks me : I would , while it was smiling in my face , Have pluck 'd my nipple from his boneless gums , And dash 'd the brains out , had I so sworn as you Have done to this .
MACBETH : If we should fail ?
LADY MACBETH : We fail ! But screw your courage to the sticking-place , And we 'll not fail . When Duncan is asleep-- Whereto the rather shall his day 's hard journey Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory , the warder of the brain , Shall be a fume , and the receipt of reason A limbeck only : when in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death , What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan ? what not put upon His spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell ?
","She decides her husband is too kind to follow his ambitions, and vows to push him to murder Duncan and take the crown that very night. Macbeth at first resists his wife's plan, but his ambition and her constant questioning of his courage and manhood win him over."
"LADY MACBETH : Who dares receive it other , As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar Upon his death ?
MACBETH : I am settled , and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat . Away , and mock the time with fairest show : False face must hide what the false heart doth know . Enter BANQUO , and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him
BANQUO : How goes the night , boy ?
FLEANCE : The moon is down ; I have not heard the clock .
BANQUO : And she goes down at twelve .
FLEANCE : I take 't , ' tis later , sir .
BANQUO : Hold , take my sword . There 's husbandry in heaven ; Their candles are all out . Take thee that too . A heavy summons lies like lead upon me , And yet I would not sleep : merciful powers , Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose ! Enter MACBETH , and a Servant with a torch Give me my sword . Who 's there ?
MACBETH : A friend .
BANQUO : What , sir , not yet at rest ? The king 's a-bed : He hath been in unusual pleasure , and Sent forth great largess to your offices . This diamond he greets your wife withal , By the name of most kind hostess ; and shut up In measureless content .
MACBETH : Being unprepared , Our will became the servant to defect ; Which else should free have wrought .
BANQUO : All 's well . I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters : To you they have show 'd some truth .
MACBETH : I think not of them : Yet , when we can entreat an hour to serve , We would spend it in some words upon that business , If you would grant the time .
BANQUO : At your kind 'st leisure .
MACBETH : If you shall cleave to my consent , when ' tis , It shall make honour for you .
BANQUO : So I lose none In seeking to augment it , but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear , I shall be counsell 'd .
MACBETH : Good repose the while !
BANQUO : Thanks , sir : the like to you !
MACBETH : Go bid thy mistress , when my drink is ready , She strike upon the bell . Get thee to bed . Exit Servant Is this a dagger which I see before me , The handle toward my hand ? Come , let me clutch thee . I have thee not , and yet I see thee still . Art thou not , fatal vision , sensible To feeling as to sight ? or art thou but A dagger of the mind , a false creation , Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain ? I see thee yet , in form as palpable As this which now I draw . Thou marshall 'st me the way that I was going ; And such an instrument I was to use . Mine eyes are made the fools o ' the other senses , Or else worth all the rest ; I see thee still , And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood , Which was not so before . There 's no such thing : It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes . Now o 'er the one halfworld Nature seems dead , and wicked dreams abuse The curtain 'd sleep ; witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate 's offerings , and wither 'd murder , Alarum 'd by his sentinel , the wolf , Whose howl 's his watch , thus with his stealthy pace . With Tarquin 's ravishing strides , towards his design Moves like a ghost . Thou sure and firm-set earth , Hear not my steps , which way they walk , for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout , And take the present horror from the time , Which now suits with it . Whiles I threat , he lives : Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives . A bell rings I go , and it is done ; the bell invites me . Hear it not , Duncan ; for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell . Exit Enter LADY MACBETH
","He murders Duncan, making it seem that the servants were to blame and describes the scene to his wife."
"MACBETH : Who 's there ? what , ho !
LADY MACBETH : Alack , I am afraid they have awaked , And ' tis not done . The attempt and not the deed Confounds us . Hark ! I laid their daggers ready ; He could not miss ' em . Had he not resembled My father as he slept , I had done 't . Enter MACBETH My husband !
MACBETH : I have done the deed . Didst thou not hear a noise ?
LADY MACBETH : I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry . Did not you speak ?
MACBETH : When ?
LADY MACBETH : Now .
MACBETH : As I descended ?
LADY MACBETH : Ay .
MACBETH : Hark ! Who lies i ' the second chamber ?
LADY MACBETH : Donalbain .
MACBETH : This is a sorry sight . Looking on his hands
LADY MACBETH : A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight .
MACBETH : There 's one did laugh in 's sleep , and one cried ' Murder ! ' That they did wake each other : I stood and heard them : But they did say their prayers , and address 'd them Again to sleep .
LADY MACBETH : There are two lodged together .
MACBETH : One cried ' God bless us ! ' and ' Amen ' the other ; As they had seen me with these hangman 's hands . Listening their fear , I could not say ' Amen , ' When they did say ' God bless us ! '
LADY MACBETH : Consider it not so deeply .
MACBETH : But wherefore could not I pronounce ' Amen ' ? I had most need of blessing , and ' Amen ' Stuck in my throat .
LADY MACBETH : These deeds must not be thought After these ways ; so , it will make us mad .
MACBETH : Methought I heard a voice cry ' Sleep no more ! Macbeth does murder sleep ' , the innocent sleep , Sleep that knits up the ravell 'd sleeve of care , The death of each day 's life , sore labour 's bath , Balm of hurt minds , great nature 's second course , Chief nourisher in life 's feast , --
LADY MACBETH : What do you mean ?
MACBETH : Still it cried ' Sleep no more ! ' to all the house : ' Glamis hath murder 'd sleep , and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more ; Macbeth shall sleep no more . ' 
LADY MACBETH : Who was it that thus cried ? Why , worthy thane , You do unbend your noble strength , to think So brainsickly of things . Go get some water , And wash this filthy witness from your hand . Why did you bring these daggers from the place ? They must lie there : go carry them ; and smear The sleepy grooms with blood .
MACBETH : I 'll go no more : I am afraid to think what I have done ; Look on 't again I dare not .
LADY MACBETH : Infirm of purpose ! Give me the daggers : the sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures : ' tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil . If he do bleed , I 'll gild the faces of the grooms withal ; For it must seem their guilt . Exit . Knocking within
MACBETH : Whence is that knocking ? How is 't with me , when every noise appals me ? What hands are here ? ha ! they pluck out mine eyes . Will all great Neptune 's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand ? No , this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas in incarnadine , Making the green one red . Re-enter LADY MACBETH
LADY MACBETH : My hands are of your colour ; but I shame To wear a heart so white . Knocking within I hear a knocking At the south entry : retire we to our chamber ; A little water clears us of this deed : How easy is it , then ! Your constancy Hath left you unattended . Knocking within Hark ! more knocking . Get on your nightgown , lest occasion call us , And show us to be watchers . Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts .

Who 's there , in the other devil 's name ?

MACDUFF : Was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , That you do lie so late ?
Porter : ' Faith sir , we were carousing till the second cock : and drink , sir , is a great provoker of three things .
MACDUFF : What three things does drink especially provoke ?
Porter : Marry , sir , nose-painting , sleep , and urine . Lechery , sir , it provokes , and unprovokes ; it provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance : therefore , much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery : it makes him , and it mars him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it persuades him , and disheartens him ; makes him stand to , and not stand to ; in conclusion , equivocates him in a sleep , and , giving him the lie , leaves him .
MACDUFF : I believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
Porter : That it did , sir , i ' the very throat on me : but I requited him for his lie ; and , I think , being too strong for him , though he took up my legs sometime , yet I made a shift to cast him .
MACDUFF : Is thy master stirring ? Enter MACBETH Our knocking has awaked him ; here he comes .
LENNOX : Good morrow , noble sir .
MACBETH : Good morrow , both .

LENNOX : Goes the king hence to-day ?
MACBETH : He does : he did appoint so .
LENNOX : The night has been unruly : where we lay , Our chimneys were blown down ; and , as they say , Lamentings heard i ' the air ; strange screams of death , And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatch 'd to the woeful time : the obscure bird Clamour 'd the livelong night : some say , the earth Was feverous and did shake .

DONALBAIN : What is amiss ?
MACBETH : You are , and do not know 't : The spring , the head , the fountain of your blood Is stopp 'd ; the very source of it is stopp 'd .
MACDUFF : Your royal father ' s murder 'd .
MALCOLM : O , by whom ?
LENNOX : Those of his chamber , as it seem 'd , had done ' t : Their hands and faces were an badged with blood ; So were their daggers , which unwiped we found Upon their pillows : They stared , and were distracted ; no man 's life Was to be trusted with them .
MACBETH : O , yet I do repent me of my fury , That I did kill them .
MACDUFF : Wherefore did you so ?
MACBETH : Who can be wise , amazed , temperate and furious , Loyal and neutral , in a moment ? No man : The expedition my violent love Outrun the pauser , reason . Here lay Duncan , His silver skin laced with his golden blood ; And his gash 'd stabs look 'd like a breach in nature For ruin 's wasteful entrance : there , the murderers , Steep 'd in the colours of their trade , their daggers Unmannerly breech 'd with gore : who could refrain , That had a heart to love , and in that heart Courage to make ' s love kno wn ?

MACDUFF : Look to the lady .
MALCOLM : Why do we hold our tongues , That most may claim this argument for ours ?
DONALBAIN : What should be spoken here , where our fate , Hid in an auger-hole , may rush , and seize us ? Let ' s away ; Our tears are not yet brew 'd .
MALCOLM : Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion .
BANQUO : Look to the lady : LADY MACBETH is carried out And when we have our naked frailties hid , That suffer in exposure , let us meet , And question this most bloody piece of work , To know it further . Fears and scruples shake us : In the great hand of God I stand ; and thence Against the undivulged pretence I fight Of treasonous malice .
MACDUFF : And so do I.

ALL : Well contented .

"DONALBAIN : To Ireland , I ; our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer : where we are , There 's daggers in men 's smiles : the near in blood , The nearer bloody .
MALCOLM : This murderous shaft that 's shot Hath not yet lighted , and our safest way Is to avoid the aim . Therefore , to horse ; And let us not be dainty of leave-taking , But shift away : there 's warrant in that theft Which steals itself , when there 's no mercy left . Enter ROSS and an old Man
Old Man : Threescore and ten I can remember well : Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange ; but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings .
ROSS : Ah , good father , Thou seest , the heavens , as troubled with man 's act , Threaten his bloody stage : by the clock , ' tis day , And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp : Is 't night 's predominance , or the day 's shame , That darkness does the face of earth entomb , When living light should kiss it ?
Old Man : ' Tis unnatural , Even like the deed that 's done . On Tuesday last , A falcon , towering in her pride of place , Was by a mousing owl hawk 'd at and kill 'd .
ROSS : And Duncan 's horses--a thing most strange and certain-- Beauteous and swift , the minions of their race , Turn 'd wild in nature , broke their stalls , flung out , Contending ' gainst obedience , as they would make War with mankind .
Old Man : ' Tis said they eat each other .
ROSS : They did so , to the amazement of mine eyes That look 'd upon 't . Here comes the good Macduff . Enter MACDUFF How goes the world , sir , now ?
MACDUFF : Why , see you not ?
ROSS : Is 't known who did this more than bloody deed ?
MACDUFF : Those that Macbeth hath slain .
ROSS : Alas , the day ! What good could they pretend ?
MACDUFF : They were suborn 'd : Malcolm and Donalbain , the king 's two sons , Are stol 'n away and fled ; which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed .
ROSS : ' Gainst nature still ! Thriftless ambition , that wilt ravin up Thine own life 's means ! Then ' tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth .
MACDUFF : He is already named , and gone to Scone To be invested .
ROSS : Where is Duncan 's body ?
MACDUFF : Carried to Colmekill , The sacred storehouse of his predecessors , And guardian of their bones .
ROSS : Will you to Scone ?
MACDUFF : No , cousin , I 'll to Fife .
ROSS : Well , I will thither .

BANQUO : Thou hast it now : king , Cawdor , Glamis , all , As the weird women promised , and , I fear , Thou play 'dst most foully for 't : yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity , But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings . If there come truth from them-- As upon thee , Macbeth , their speeches shine-- Why , by the verities on thee made good , May they not be my oracles as well , And set me up in hope ? But hush ! no more . Sennet sounded . Enter MACBETH , as king , LADY MACBETH , as queen , LENNOX , ROSS , Lords , Ladies , and Attendants
MACBETH : Here 's our chief guest .
LADY MACBETH : If he had been forgotten , It had been as a gap in our great feast , And all-thing unbecoming .
MACBETH : To-night we hold a solemn supper sir , And I 'll request your presence .
","Soon after, Ross and Macduff reflect on what has happened, and Macduff reports that Macbeth has been made king."
"MACBETH : Ride you this afternoon ?
BANQUO : Ay , my good lord .
MACBETH : We should have else desired your good advice , Which still hath been both grave and prosperous , In this day 's council ; but we 'll take to-morrow . Is 't far you ride ?
BANQUO : As far , my lord , as will fill up the time ' Twixt this and supper : go not my horse the better , I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain .
MACBETH : Fail not our feast .
BANQUO : My lord , I will not .
MACBETH : We hear , our bloody cousins are bestow 'd In England and in Ireland , not confessing Their cruel parricide , filling their hearers With strange invention : but of that to-morrow , When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly . Hie you to horse : adieu , Till you return at night . Goes Fleance with you ?
BANQUO : Ay , my good lord : our time does call upon ' s .
MACBETH : I wish your horses swift and sure of foot ; And so I do commend you to their backs . Farewell . Exit BANQUO Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night : to make society The sweeter welcome , we will keep ourself Till supper-time alone : while then , God be with you ! Sirrah , a word with you : attend those men Our pleasure ?
ATTENDANT : They are , my lord , without the palace gate .
MACBETH : Bring them before us . Exit Attendant To be thus is nothing ; But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo Stick deep ; and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear 'd : ' tis much he dares ; And , to that dauntless temper of his mind , He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour To act in safety . There is none but he Whose being I do fear : and , under him , My Genius is rebuked ; as , it is said , Mark Antony 's was by Caesar . He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me , And bade them speak to him : then prophet-like They hail 'd him father to a line of kings : Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown , And put a barren sceptre in my gripe , Thence to be wrench 'd with an unlineal hand , No son of mine succeeding . If ' t be so , For Banquo 's issue have I filed my mind ; For them the gracious Duncan have I murder 'd ; Put rancours in the vessel of my peace Only for them ; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man , To make them kings , the seed of Banquo kings ! Rather than so , come fate into the list . And champion me to the utterance ! Who 's there ! Re-enter Attendant , with two Murderers Now go to the door , and stay there till we call . Exit Attendant Was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
First Murderer : It was , so please your highness .
MACBETH : Well then , now Have you consider 'd of my speeches ? Know That it was he in the times past which held you So under fortune , which you thought had been Our innocent self : this I made good to you In our last conference , pass 'd in probation with you , How you were borne in hand , how cross 'd , the instruments , Who wrought with them , and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say ' Thus did Banquo . ' 
First Murderer : You made it known to us .
MACBETH : I did so , and went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go ? Are you so gospell 'd To pray for this good man and for his issue , Whose heavy hand hath bow 'd you to the grave And beggar 'd yours for ever ?
First Murderer : We are men , my liege .
","Macbeth is made king, and because they ran, Duncan's sons become the prime suspects in their father's murder.  Because he knows the witches' prophecy, Banquo is suspicious of Macbeth. And because of the prophecy that Banquo's line will reign as kings, Macbeth sees Banquo as a threat. Macbeth gives a feast, inviting many thanes, including Banquo."
"Second Murderer : I am one , my liege , Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world .
First Murderer : And I another So weary with disasters , tugg 'd with fortune , That I would set my lie on any chance , To mend it , or be rid on 't .
MACBETH : Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy .
Both Murderers : True , my lord .
MACBETH : So is he mine ; and in such bloody distance , That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near 'st of life : and though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it , yet I must not , For certain friends that are both his and mine , Whose loves I may not drop , but wail his fall Who I myself struck down ; and thence it is , That I to your assistance do make love , Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons .
Second Murderer : We shall , my lord , Perform what you command us .
First Murderer : Though our lives--
MACBETH : Your spirits shine through you . Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves ; Acquaint you with the perfect spy o ' the time , The moment on 't ; for 't must be done to-night , And something from the palace ; always thought That I require a clearness : and with him-- To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-- Fleance his son , that keeps him company , Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father 's , must embrace the fate Of that dark hour . Resolve yourselves apart : I 'll come to you anon .
Both Murderers : We are resolved , my lord .
MACBETH : I 'll call upon you straight : abide within . It is concluded . Banquo , thy soul 's flight , If it find heaven , must find it out to-night . Exit Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant
LADY MACBETH : Is Banquo gone from court ?
Servant : Ay , madam , but returns again to-night .
LADY MACBETH : Say to the king , I would attend his leisure For a few words .
Servant : Madam , I will . Exit
LADY MACBETH : Nought 's had , all 's spent , Where our desire is got without content : ' Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy . Enter MACBETH How now , my lord ! why do you keep alone , Of sorriest fancies your companions making , Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on ? Things without all remedy Should be without regard : what 's done is done .
MACBETH : We have scotch 'd the snake , not kill 'd it : She 'll close and be herself , whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth . But let the frame of things disjoint , both the worlds suffer , Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly : better be with the dead , Whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy . Duncan is in his grave ; After life 's fitful fever he sleeps well ; Treason has done his worst : nor steel , nor poison , Malice domestic , foreign levy , nothing , Can touch him further .
LADY MACBETH : Come on ; Gentle my lord , sleek o 'er your rugged looks ; Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night .
MACBETH : So shall I , love ; and so , I pray , be you : Let your remembrance apply to Banquo ; Present him eminence , both with eye and tongue : Unsafe the while , that we Must lave our honours in these flattering streams , And make our faces vizards to our hearts , Disguising what they are .
LADY MACBETH : You must leave this .
",Macbeth hires two murderers to kill Banquo and his son Fleance as they ride to attend the feast.
"LADY MACBETH : But in them nature 's copy 's not eterne .
MACBETH : There 's comfort yet ; they are assailable ; Then be thou jocund : ere the bat hath flown His cloister 'd flight , ere to black Hecate 's summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night 's yawning peal , there shall be done A deed of dreadful note .
LADY MACBETH : What 's to be done ?
MACBETH : Be innocent of the knowledge , dearest chuck , Till thou applaud the deed . Come , seeling night , Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day ; And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale ! Light thickens ; and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood : Good things of day begin to droop and drowse ; While night 's black agents to their preys do rouse . Thou marvell 'st at my words : but hold thee still ; Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill . So , prithee , go with me . Enter three Murderers
First Murderer : But who did bid thee join with us ?
Third Murderer : Macbeth .
Second Murderer : He needs not our mistrust , since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just .
First Murderer : Then stand with us . The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day : Now spurs the lated traveller apace To gain the timely inn ; and near approaches The subject of our watch .
Third Murderer : Hark ! I hear horses .
BANQUO : Give us a light there , ho !
Second Murderer : Then ' tis he : the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i ' the court .
First Murderer : His horses go about .
Third Murderer : Almost a mile : but he does usually , So all men do , from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk .
Second Murderer : A light , a light ! Enter BANQUO , and FLEANCE with a torch
Third Murderer : ' Tis he .
First Murderer : Stand to 't .
BANQUO : It will be rain to-night .
First Murderer : Let it come down . They set upon BANQUO
BANQUO : O , treachery ! Fly , good Fleance , fly , fly , fly ! Thou mayst revenge . O slave ! Dies . FLEANCE escapes
Third Murderer : Who did strike out the light ?
First Murderer : Wast not the way ?
Third Murderer : There 's but one down ; the son is fled .
Second Murderer : We have lost Best half of our affair .
First Murderer : Well , let 's away , and say how much is done . A banquet prepared . Enter MACBETH , LADY MACBETH , ROSS , LENNOX , Lords , and Attendants
MACBETH : You know your own degrees ; sit down : at first And last the hearty welcome .
Lords : Thanks to your majesty .
MACBETH : Ourself will mingle with society , And play the humble host . Our hostess keeps her state , but in best time We will require her welcome .
LADY MACBETH : Pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends ; For my heart speaks they are welcome . First Murderer appears at the door
MACBETH : See , they encounter thee with their hearts ' thanks . Both sides are even : here I 'll sit i ' the midst : Be large in mirth ; anon we 'll drink a measure The table round . Approaching the door There 's blood on thy face .
First Murderer : ' Tis Banquo 's then .
MACBETH : ' Tis better thee without than he within . Is he dispatch 'd ?
First Murderer : My lord , his throat is cut ; that I did for him .
MACBETH : Thou art the best o ' the cut-throats : yet he 's good That did the like for Fleance : if thou didst it , Thou art the nonpareil .
First Murderer : Most royal sir , Fleance is ' scaped .
","The men kill Banquo, but Fleance escapes."
"First Murderer : Ay , my good lord : safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head ; The least a death to nature .
MACBETH : Thanks for that : There the grown serpent lies ; the worm that 's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed , No teeth for the present . Get thee gone : to-morrow We 'll hear , ourselves , again . Exit Murderer
LADY MACBETH : My royal lord , You do not give the cheer : the feast is sold That is not often vouch 'd , while ' tis a-making , ' Tis given with welcome : to feed were best at home ; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony ; Meeting were bare without it .
MACBETH : Sweet remembrancer ! Now , good digestion wait on appetite , And health on both !
LENNOX : May 't please your highness sit . The GHOST OF BANQUO enters , and sits in MACBETH 's place
MACBETH : Here had we now our country 's honour roof 'd , Were the graced person of our Banquo present ; Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance !
ROSS : His absence , sir , Lays blame upon his promise . Please 't your highness To grace us with your royal company .
MACBETH : The table 's full .
LENNOX : Here is a place reserved , sir .
MACBETH : Where ?
LENNOX : Here , my good lord . What is 't that moves your highness ?
MACBETH : Which of you have done this ?
Lords : What , my good lord ?
MACBETH : Thou canst not say I did it : never shake Thy gory locks at me .
ROSS : Gentlemen , rise : his highness is not well .
LADY MACBETH : Sit , worthy friends : my lord is often thus , And hath been from his youth : pray you , keep seat ; The fit is momentary ; upon a thought He will again be well : if much you note him , You shall offend him and extend his passion : Feed , and regard him not . Are you a man ?
MACBETH : Ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that Which might appal the devil .
LADY MACBETH : O proper stuff ! This is the very painting of your fear : This is the air-drawn dagger which , you said , Led you to Duncan . O , these flaws and starts , Impostors to true fear , would well become A woman 's story at a winter 's fire , Authorized by her grandam . Shame itself ! Why do you make such faces ? When all 's done , You look but on a stool .
MACBETH : Prithee , see there ! behold ! look ! lo ! how say you ? Why , what care I ? If thou canst nod , speak too . If charnel-houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back , our monuments Shall be the maws of kites . GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
LADY MACBETH : What , quite unmann 'd in folly ?
MACBETH : If I stand here , I saw him .
LADY MACBETH : Fie , for shame !
MACBETH : Blood hath been shed ere now , i ' the olden time , Ere human statute purged the gentle weal ; Ay , and since too , murders have been perform 'd Too terrible for the ear : the times have been , That , when the brains were out , the man would die , And there an end ; but now they rise again , With twenty mortal murders on their crowns , And push us from our stools : this is more strange Than such a murder is .
LADY MACBETH : My worthy lord , Your noble friends do lack you .
","At the feast, Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost, though no one else does. Macbeth's behavior and the death of Banquo make all the thanes suspicious."
"Lords : Our duties , and the pledge . Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO
MACBETH : Avaunt ! and quit my sight ! let the earth hide thee ! Thy bones are marrowless , thy blood is cold ; Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with !
LADY MACBETH : Think of this , good peers , But as a thing of custom : ' tis no other ; Only it spoils the pleasure of the time .
MACBETH : What man dare , I dare : Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear , The arm 'd rhinoceros , or the Hyrcan tiger ; Take any shape but that , and my firm nerves Shall never tremble : or be alive again , And dare me to the desert with thy sword ; If trembling I inhabit then , protest me The baby of a girl . Hence , horrible shadow ! Unreal mockery , hence ! GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes Why , so : being gone , I am a man again . Pray you , sit still .
LADY MACBETH : You have displaced the mirth , broke the good meeting , With most admired disorder .
MACBETH : Can such things be , And overcome us like a summer 's cloud , Without our special wonder ? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe , When now I think you can behold such sights , And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks , When mine is blanched with fear .
ROSS : What sights , my lord ?
LADY MACBETH : I pray you , speak not ; he grows worse and worse ; Question enrages him . At once , good night : Stand not upon the order of your going , But go at once .
LENNOX : Good night ; and better health Attend his majesty !
LADY MACBETH : A kind good night to all !
MACBETH : It will have blood ; they say , blood will have blood : Stones have been known to move and trees to speak ; Augurs and understood relations have By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret 'st man of blood . What is the night ?
LADY MACBETH : Almost at odds with morning , which is which .
MACBETH : How say 'st thou , that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding ?
LADY MACBETH : Did you send to him , sir ?
MACBETH : I hear it by the way ; but I will send : There 's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee 'd . I will to-morrow , And betimes I will , to the weird sisters : More shall they speak ; for now I am bent to know , By the worst means , the worst . For mine own good , All causes shall give way : I am in blood Stepp 'd in so far that , should I wade no more , Returning were as tedious as go o 'er : Strange things I have in head , that will to hand ; Which must be acted ere they may be scann 'd .
LADY MACBETH : You lack the season of all natures , sleep .
MACBETH : Come , we 'll to sleep . My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use : We are yet but young in deed . Thunder . Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE
First Witch : Why , how now , Hecate ! you look angerly .
",Macbeth decides to return to the witches to find out his fate.
"First Witch : Come , let 's make haste ; she 'll soon be back again . Enter LENNOX and another Lord
LENNOX : My former speeches have but hit your thoughts , Which can interpret further : only , I say , Things have been strangely borne . The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth : marry , he was dead : And the right-valiant Banquo walk 'd too late ; Whom , you may say , if 't please you , Fleance kill 'd , For Fleance fled : men must not walk too late . Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father ? damned fact ! How it did grieve Macbeth ! did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear , That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep ? Was not that nobly done ? Ay , and wisely too ; For ' twould have anger 'd any heart alive To hear the men deny 't . So that , I say , He has borne all things well : and I do think That had he Duncan 's sons under his key-- As , an 't please heaven , he shall not--they should find What ' twere to kill a father ; so should Fleance . But , peace ! for from broad words and ' cause he fail 'd His presence at the tyrant 's feast , I hear Macduff lives in disgrace : sir , can you tell Where he bestows himself ?
Lord : The son of Duncan , From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth Lives in the English court , and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect : thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king , upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward : That , by the help of these--with Him above To ratify the work--we may again Give to our tables meat , sleep to our nights , Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives , Do faithful homage and receive free honours : All which we pine for now : and this report Hath so exasperate the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war .
LENNOX : Sent he to Macduff ?
Lord : He did : and with an absolute ' Sir , not I , ' The cloudy messenger turns me his back , And hums , as who should say ' You 'll rue the time That clogs me with this answer . ' 
LENNOX : And that well might Advise him to a caution , to hold what distance His wisdom can provide . Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come , that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed !
Lord : I 'll send my prayers with him . Thunder . Enter the three Witches

ALL : Double , double toil and trouble ; Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
Second Witch : Fillet of a fenny snake , In the cauldron boil and bake ; Eye of newt and toe of frog , Wool of bat and tongue of dog , Adder 's fork and blind-worm 's sting , Lizard 's leg and owlet 's wing , For a charm of powerful trouble , Like a hell-broth boil and bubble .
ALL : Double , double toil and trouble ; Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
","Macduff refuses to appear at the royal court at all, and goes to England to support Malcolm in his effort to raise an army against Macbeth."

MACBETH : How now , you secret , black , and midnight hags ! What is 't you do ?
ALL : A deed without a name .
MACBETH : I conjure you , by that which you profess , Howe 'er you come to know it , answer me : Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches ; though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up ; Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down ; Though castles topple on their warders ' heads ; Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations ; though the treasure Of nature 's germens tumble all together , Even till destruction sicken ; answer me To what I ask you .
First Witch : Speak .
Second Witch : Demand .
Third Witch : We 'll answer .
First Witch : Say , if thou 'dst rather hear it from our mouths , Or from our masters ?
MACBETH : Call ' em ; let me see ' em .

But yet I 'll make assurance double sure , And take a bond of fate : thou shalt not live ; That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies , And sleep in spite of thunder . Thunder . Third Apparition : a Child crowned , with a tree in his hand What is this That rises like the issue of a king , And wears upon his baby-brow the round And top of sovereignty ?
ALL : Listen , but speak not to 't .
Third Apparition : Be lion-mettled , proud ; and take no care Who chafes , who frets , or where conspirers are : Macbeth shall never vanquish 'd be until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against him . Descends
MACBETH : That will never be Who can impress the forest , bid the tree Unfix his earth-bound root ? Sweet bodements ! good ! Rebellion 's head , rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise , and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature , pay his breath To time and mortal custom . Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing : tell me , if your art Can tell so much : shall Banquo 's issue ever Reign in this kingdom ?
ALL : Seek to know no more .

ROSS : You must have patience , madam .
LADY MACDUFF : He had none : His flight was madness : when our actions do not , Our fears do make us traitors .
ROSS : You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
LADY MACDUFF : Wisdom ! to leave his wife , to leave his babes , His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly ? He loves us not ; He wants the natural touch : for the poor wren , The most diminutive of birds , will fight , Her young ones in her nest , against the owl . All is the fear and nothing is the love ; As little is the wisdom , where the flight So runs against all reason .

MACDUFF : Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword , and like good men Bestride our down-fall 'n birthdom : each new morn New widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows Strike heaven on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yell 'd out Like syllable of dolour .
","Many, including Macduff's family, are murdered."
"MACDUFF : I am not treacherous .
MALCOLM : But Macbeth is . A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge . But I shall crave your pardon ; That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose : Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell ; Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , Yet grace must still look so .
MACDUFF : I have lost my hopes .
MALCOLM : Perchance even there where I did find my doubts . Why in that rawness left you wife and child , Those precious motives , those strong knots of love , Without leave-taking ? I pray you , Let not my jealousies be your dishonours , But mine own safeties . You may be rightly just , Whatever I shall think .
MACDUFF : Bleed , bleed , poor country ! Great tyranny ! lay thou thy basis sure , For goodness dare not cheque thee : wear thou thy wrongs ; The title is affeer 'd ! Fare thee well , lord : I would not be the villain that thou think 'st For the whole space that 's in the tyrant 's grasp , And the rich East to boot .
MALCOLM : Be not offended : I speak not as in absolute fear of you . I think our country sinks beneath the yoke ; It weeps , it bleeds ; and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds : I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right ; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands : but , for all this , When I shall tread upon the tyrant 's head , Or wear it on my sword , yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before , More suffer and more sundry ways than ever , By him that shall succeed .
MACDUFF : What should he be ?
MALCOLM : It is myself I mean : in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That , when they shall be open 'd , black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow , and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb , being compared With my confineless harms .
MACDUFF : Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn 'd In evils to top Macbeth .
MALCOLM : I grant him bloody , Luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , Sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin That has a name : but there 's no bottom , none , In my voluptuousness : your wives , your daughters , Your matrons and your maids , could not fill up The cistern of my lust , and my desire All continent impediments would o 'erbear That did oppose my will : better Macbeth Than such an one to reign .
MACDUFF : Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny ; it hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings . But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours : you may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , And yet seem cold , the time you may so hoodwink . We have willing dames enough : there cannot be That vulture in you , to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves , Finding it so inclined .
MALCOLM : With this there grows In my most ill-composed affection such A stanchless avarice that , were I king , I should cut off the nobles for their lands , Desire his jewels and this other 's house : And my more-having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more ; that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal , Destroying them for wealth .
MACDUFF : This avarice Sticks deeper , grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust , and it hath been The sword of our slain kings : yet do not fear ; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will . Of your mere own : all these are portable , With other graces weigh 'd .
","Malcolm, tests Macduff's allegiance to Scotland by first painting a bleak picture of his own personality as a future king, then revealing his true character."
"MACDUFF : O Scotland , Scotland !
MALCOLM : If such a one be fit to govern , speak : I am as I have spoken .
MACDUFF : Fit to govern ! No , not to live . O nation miserable , With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter 'd , When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again , Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed , And does blaspheme his breed ? Thy royal father Was a most sainted king : the queen that bore thee , Oftener upon her knees than on her feet , Died every day she lived . Fare thee well ! These evils thou repeat 'st upon thyself Have banish 'd me from Scotland . O my breast , Thy hope ends here !
MALCOLM : Macduff , this noble passion , Child of integrity , hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples , reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honour . Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power , and modest wisdom plucks me From over-credulous haste : but God above Deal between thee and me ! for even now I put myself to thy direction , and Unspeak mine own detraction , here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself , For strangers to my nature . I am yet Unknown to woman , never was forsworn , Scarcely have coveted what was mine own , At no time broke my faith , would not betray The devil to his fellow and delight No less in truth than life : my first false speaking Was this upon myself : what I am truly , Is thine and my poor country 's to command : Whither indeed , before thy here-approach , Old Siward , with ten thousand warlike men , Already at a point , was setting forth . Now we 'll together ; and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel ! Why are you silent ?
MACDUFF : Such welcome and unwelcome things at once ' Tis hard to reconcile . Enter a Doctor
MALCOLM : Well ; more anon.--Comes the king forth , I pray you ?
Doctor : Ay , sir ; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure : their malady convinces The great assay of art ; but at his touch-- Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand-- They presently amend .
MALCOLM : I thank you , doctor . Exit Doctor
MACDUFF : What 's the disease he means ?
MALCOLM : ' Tis call 'd the evil : A most miraculous work in this good king ; Which often , since my here-remain in England , I have seen him do . How he solicits heaven , Himself best knows : but strangely-visited people , All swoln and ulcerous , pitiful to the eye , The mere despair of surgery , he cures , Hanging a golden stamp about their necks , Put on with holy prayers : and ' tis spoken , To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction . With this strange virtue , He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy , And sundry blessings hang about his throne , That speak him full of grace . Enter ROSS
MACDUFF : See , who comes here ?
MALCOLM : My countryman ; but yet I know him not .
MACDUFF : My ever-gentle cousin , welcome hither .
MALCOLM : I know him now . Good God , betimes remove The means that makes us strangers !
ROSS : Sir , amen .
MACDUFF : Stands Scotland where it did ?
ROSS : Alas , poor country ! Almost afraid to know itself . It cannot Be call 'd our mother , but our grave ; where nothing , But who knows nothing , is once seen to smile ; Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made , not mark 'd ; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy ; the dead man 's knell Is there scarce ask 'd for who ; and good men 's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps , Dying or ere they sicken .
MACDUFF : O , relation Too nice , and yet too true !
MALCOLM : What 's the newest grief ?
ROSS : That of an hour 's age doth hiss the speaker : Each minute teems a new one .
","They agree to fight together, with English support. During the meeting, Ross brings news of the murder of Macduff's family."
"ROSS : Why , well .
MACDUFF : And all my children ?
ROSS : Well too .
MACDUFF : The tyrant has not batter 'd at their peace ?
ROSS : No ; they were well at peace when I did leave ' em .
MACDUFF : But not a niggard of your speech : how goes 't ?
ROSS : When I came hither to transport the tidings , Which I have heavily borne , there ran a rumour Of many worthy fellows that were out ; Which was to my belief witness 'd the rather , For that I saw the tyrant 's power a-foot : Now is the time of help ; your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers , make our women fight , To doff their dire distresses .
MALCOLM : Be 't their comfort We are coming thither : gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men ; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out .
ROSS : Would I could answer This comfort with the like ! But I have words That would be howl 'd out in the desert air , Where hearing should not latch them .
MACDUFF : What concern they ? The general cause ? or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast ?
ROSS : No mind that 's honest But in it shares some woe ; though the main part Pertains to you alone .
MACDUFF : If it be mine , Keep it not from me , quickly let me have it .
ROSS : Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever , Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard .
MACDUFF : Hum ! I guess at it .
ROSS : Your castle is surprised ; your wife and babes Savagely slaughter 'd : to relate the manner , Were , on the quarry of these murder 'd deer , To add the death of you .
MALCOLM : Merciful heaven ! What , man ! ne 'er pull your hat upon your brows ; Give sorrow words : the grief that does not speak Whispers the o 'er-fraught heart and bids it break .
MACDUFF : My children too ?
ROSS : Wife , children , servants , all That could be found .
MACDUFF : And I must be from thence ! My wife kill 'd too ?
ROSS : I have said .
MALCOLM : Be comforted : Let 's make us medicines of our great revenge , To cure this deadly grief .
MACDUFF : He has no children . All my pretty ones ? Did you say all ? O hell-kite ! All ? What , all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop ?
MALCOLM : Dispute it like a man .
MACDUFF : I shall do so ; But I must also feel it as a man : I cannot but remember such things were , That were most precious to me . Did heaven look on , And would not take their part ? Sinful Macduff , They were all struck for thee ! naught that I am , Not for their own demerits , but for mine , Fell slaughter on their souls . Heaven rest them now !
MALCOLM : Be this the whetstone of your sword : let grief Convert to anger ; blunt not the heart , enrage it .
MACDUFF : O , I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue ! But , gentle heavens , Cut short all intermission ; front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself ; Within my sword 's length set him ; if he ' scape , Heaven forgive him too !
MALCOLM : This tune goes manly . Come , go we to the king ; our power is ready ; Our lack is nothing but our leave ; Macbeth Is ripe for shaking , and the powers above Put on their instruments . Receive what cheer you may : The night is long that never finds the day . Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman
Doctor : I have two nights watched with you , but can perceive no truth in your report . When was it she last walked ?
","When news comes to England of the murder of Macduff's family, Macduff, weeping, vows revenge."
"Doctor : A great perturbation in nature , to receive at once the benefit of sleep , and do the effects of watching ! In this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
Gentlewoman : That , sir , which I will not report after her .
Doctor : You may to me : and ' tis most meet you should .
Gentlewoman : Neither to you nor any one ; having no witness to confirm my speech . Enter LADY MACBETH , with a taper Lo you , here she comes ! This is her very guise ; and , upon my life , fast asleep . Observe her ; stand close .
Doctor : How came she by that light ?
Gentlewoman : Why , it stood by her : she has light by her continually ; ' tis her command .
Doctor : You see , her eyes are open .
Gentlewoman : Ay , but their sense is shut .
Doctor : What is it she does now ? Look , how she rubs her hands .
Gentlewoman : It is an accustomed action with her , to seem thus washing her hands : I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour .
LADY MACBETH : Yet here 's a spot .
Doctor : Hark ! she speaks : I will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
LADY MACBETH : Out , damned spot ! out , I say ! --One : two : why , then , ' tis time to do 't.--Hell is murky ! --Fie , my lord , fie ! a soldier , and afeard ? What need we fear who knows it , when none can call our power to account ? --Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him .
Doctor : Do you mark that ?
LADY MACBETH : The thane of Fife had a wife : where is she now ? -- What , will these hands ne 'er be clean ? --No more o ' that , my lord , no more o ' that : you mar all with this starting .
Doctor : Go to , go to ; you have known what you should not .
Gentlewoman : She has spoke what she should not , I am sure of that : heaven knows what she has known .
LADY MACBETH : Here 's the smell of the blood still : all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . Oh , oh , oh !
Doctor : What a sigh is there ! The heart is sorely charged .
Gentlewoman : I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
Doctor : Well , well , well , --
Gentlewoman : Pray God it be , sir .
Doctor : This disease is beyond my practise : yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
LADY MACBETH : Wash your hands , put on your nightgown ; look not so pale.--I tell you yet again , Banquo 's buried ; he cannot come out on 's grave .
Doctor : Even so ?
LADY MACBETH : To bed , to bed ! there 's knocking at the gate : come , come , come , come , give me your hand . What 's done cannot be undone.--To bed , to bed , to bed ! Exit
Doctor : Will she go now to bed ?
Gentlewoman : Directly .
Doctor : Foul whisperings are abroad : unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles : infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets : More needs she the divine than the physician . God , God forgive us all ! Look after her ; Remove from her the means of all annoyance , And still keep eyes upon her . So , good night : My mind she has mated , and amazed my sight . I think , but dare not speak .
Gentlewoman : Good night , good doctor . Drum and colours . Enter MENTEITH , CAITHNESS , ANGUS , LENNOX , and Soldiers
","A doctor and gentlewoman observe Lady Macbeth sleepwalking, imagining she cannot clean her hands of Duncan's blood."
"ANGUS : Near Birnam wood Shall we well meet them ; that way are they coming .
CAITHNESS : Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother ?
LENNOX : For certain , sir , he is not : I have a file Of all the gentry : there is Siward 's son , And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood .
MENTEITH : What does the tyrant ?
CAITHNESS : Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies : Some say he 's mad ; others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury : but , for certain , He cannot buckle his distemper 'd cause Within the belt of rule .
ANGUS : Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands ; Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach ; Those he commands move only in command , Nothing in love : now does he feel his title Hang loose about him , like a giant 's robe Upon a dwarfish thief .
MENTEITH : Who then shall blame His pester 'd senses to recoil and start , When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there ?
CAITHNESS : Well , march we on , To give obedience where ' tis truly owed : Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal , And with him pour we in our country 's purge Each drop of us .
LENNOX : Or so much as it needs , To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds . Make we our march towards Birnam . Enter MACBETH , Doctor , and Attendants
MACBETH : Bring me no more reports ; let them fly all : Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane , I cannot taint with fear . What 's the boy Malcolm ? Was he not born of woman ? The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus : ' Fear not , Macbeth ; no man that 's born of woman Shall e 'er have power upon thee . ' Then fly , false thanes , And mingle with the English epicures : The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear . Enter a Servant The devil damn thee black , thou cream-faced loon ! Where got 'st thou that goose look ?
Servant : There is ten thousand--
MACBETH : Geese , villain !
Servant : Soldiers , sir .
MACBETH : Go prick thy face , and over-red thy fear , Thou lily-liver 'd boy . What soldiers , patch ? Death of thy soul ! those linen cheeks of thine Are counsellors to fear . What soldiers , whey-face ?
Servant : The English force , so please you .
MACBETH : Take thy face hence . Exit Servant Seyton ! --I am sick at heart , When I behold--Seyton , I say ! --This push Will cheer me ever , or disseat me now . I have lived long enough : my way of life Is fall 'n into the sear , the yellow leaf ; And that which should accompany old age , As honour , love , obedience , troops of friends , I must not look to have ; but , in their stead , Curses , not loud but deep , mouth-honour , breath , Which the poor heart would fain deny , and dare not . Seyton ! Enter SEYTON
SEYTON : What is your gracious pleasure ?
MACBETH : What news more ?
SEYTON : All is confirm 'd , my lord , which was reported .
MACBETH : I 'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack 'd . Give me my armour .
SEYTON : ' Tis not needed yet .
MACBETH : I 'll put it on . Send out more horses ; skirr the country round ; Hang those that talk of fear . Give me mine armour . How does your patient , doctor ?
Doctor : Not so sick , my lord , As she is troubled with thick coming fancies , That keep her from her rest .
MACBETH : Cure her of that . Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased , Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow , Raze out the written troubles of the brain And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuff 'd bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart ?
Doctor : Therein the patient Must minister to himself .
","Macbeth has become manic, cruel, and haughty-many of his men desert to Malcolm's side."
"Doctor : Ay , my good lord ; your royal preparation Makes us hear something .
MACBETH : Bring it after me . I will not be afraid of death and bane , Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane .
Doctor : Were I from Dunsinane away and clear , Profit again should hardly draw me here . Drum and colours . Enter MALCOLM , SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD , MACDUFF , MENTEITH , CAITHNESS , ANGUS , LENNOX , ROSS , and Soldiers , marching
MALCOLM : Cousins , I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe .
MENTEITH : We doubt it nothing .
SIWARD : What wood is this before us ?
MENTEITH : The wood of Birnam .
MALCOLM : Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear 't before him : thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us .
Soldiers : It shall be done .
SIWARD : We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane , and will endure Our setting down before ' t .
MALCOLM : ' Tis his main hope : For where there is advantage to be given , Both more and less have given him the revolt , And none serve with him but constrained things Whose hearts are absent too .
MACDUFF : Let our just censures Attend the true event , and put we on Industrious soldiership .
SIWARD : The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe . Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate , But certain issue strokes must arbitrate : Towards which advance the war . Enter MACBETH , SEYTON , and Soldiers , with drum and colours
MACBETH : Hang out our banners on the outward walls ; The cry is still ' They come : ' our castle 's strength Will laugh a siege to scorn : here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up : Were they not forced with those that should be ours , We might have met them dareful , beard to beard , And beat them backward home . A cry of women within What is that noise ?
SEYTON : It is the cry of women , my good lord . Exit
MACBETH : I have almost forgot the taste of fears ; The time has been , my senses would have cool 'd To hear a night-shriek ; and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in 't : I have supp 'd full with horrors ; Direness , familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me . Re-enter SEYTON Wherefore was that cry ?
SEYTON : The queen , my lord , is dead .
MACBETH : She should have died hereafter ; There would have been a time for such a word . To-morrow , and to-morrow , and to-morrow , Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time , And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death . Out , out , brief candle ! Life 's but a walking shadow , a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more : it is a tale Told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , Signifying nothing . Enter a Messenger Thou comest to use thy tongue ; thy story quickly .
Messenger : Gracious my lord , I should report that which I say I saw , But know not how to do it .
MACBETH : Well , say , sir .
Messenger : As I did stand my watch upon the hill , I look 'd toward Birnam , and anon , methought , The wood began to move .
MACBETH : Liar and slave !
Messenger : Let me endure your wrath , if 't be not so : Within this three mile may you see it coming ; I say , a moving grove .
","The Scottish nobles gather, and Malcolm orders his men to camouflage themselves with tree branches as they attack, thus giving the appearance of Birnam Wood approaching Dunsinane. Macbeth learns his wife has died."
"MALCOLM : Now near enough : your leafy screens throw down . And show like those you are . You , worthy uncle , Shall , with my cousin , your right-noble son , Lead our first battle : worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon ' s what else remains to do , According to our order .
SIWARD : Fare you well . Do we but find the tyrant 's power to-night , Let us be beaten , if we cannot fight .
MACDUFF : Make all our trumpets speak ; give them all breath , Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death . Alarums . Enter MACBETH
MACBETH : They have tied me to a stake ; I cannot fly , But , bear-like , I must fight the course . What 's he That was not born of woman ? Such a one Am I to fear , or none . Enter YOUNG SIWARD
YOUNG SIWARD : What is thy name ?
MACBETH : Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it .
YOUNG SIWARD : No ; though thou call 'st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell .
MACBETH : My name 's Macbeth .
YOUNG SIWARD : The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear .
MACBETH : No , nor more fearful .
YOUNG SIWARD : Thou liest , abhorred tyrant ; with my sword I 'll prove the lie thou speak 'st . They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain
MACBETH : Thou wast born of woman But swords I smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , Brandish 'd by man that 's of a woman born . Exit Alarums . Enter MACDUFF
MACDUFF : That way the noise is . Tyrant , show thy face ! If thou be 'st slain and with no stroke of mine , My wife and children 's ghosts will haunt me still . I cannot strike at wretched kerns , whose arms Are hired to bear their staves : either thou , Macbeth , Or else my sword with an unbatter 'd edge I sheathe again undeeded . There thou shouldst be ; By this great clatter , one of greatest note Seems bruited . Let me find him , fortune ! And more I beg not . Exit . Alarums Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD
SIWARD : This way , my lord ; the castle 's gently render 'd : The tyrant 's people on both sides do fight ; The noble thanes do bravely in the war ; The day almost itself professes yours , And little is to do .
MALCOLM : We have met with foes That strike beside us .
SIWARD : Enter , sir , the castle . Enter MACBETH
MACBETH : Why should I play the Roman fool , and die On mine own sword ? whiles I see lives , the gashes Do better upon them . Enter MACDUFF
MACDUFF : Turn , hell-hound , turn !
MACBETH : Of all men else I have avoided thee : But get thee back ; my soul is too much charged With blood of thine already .
MACDUFF : I have no words : My voice is in my sword : thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out ! They fight
MACBETH : Thou losest labour : As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed : Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ; I bear a charmed life , which must not yield , To one of woman born .
MACDUFF : Despair thy charm ; And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee , Macduff was from his mother 's womb Untimely ripp 'd .
MACBETH : Accursed be that tongue that tells me so , For it hath cow 'd my better part of man ! And be these juggling fiends no more believed , That palter with us in a double sense ; That keep the word of promise to our ear , And break it to our hope . I 'll not fight with thee .
MACDUFF : Then yield thee , coward , And live to be the show and gaze o ' the time : We 'll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , Painted on a pole , and underwrit , ' Here may you see the tyrant . '

SIWARD : Some must go off : and yet , by these I see , So great a day as this is cheaply bought .
MALCOLM : Macduff is missing , and your noble son .
ROSS : Your son , my lord , has paid a soldier 's debt : He only lived but till he was a man ; The which no sooner had his prowess confirm 'd In the unshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he died .
SIWARD : Then he is dead ?
ROSS : Ay , and brought off the field : your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth , for then It hath no end .
SIWARD : Had he his hurts before ?
ROSS : Ay , on the front .
SIWARD : Why then , God 's soldier be he ! Had I as many sons as I have hairs , I would not wish them to a fairer death : And so , his knell is knoll 'd .
MALCOLM : He 's worth more sorrow , And that I 'll spend for him .
SIWARD : He 's worth no more They say he parted well , and paid his score : And so , God be with him ! Here comes newer comfort . Re-enter MACDUFF , with MACBETH 's head
MACDUFF : Hail , king ! for so thou art : behold , where stands The usurper 's cursed head : the time is free : I see thee compass 'd with thy kingdom 's pearl , That speak my salutation in their minds ; Whose voices I desire aloud with mine : Hail , King of Scotland !
ALL : Hail , King of Scotland ! Flourish
