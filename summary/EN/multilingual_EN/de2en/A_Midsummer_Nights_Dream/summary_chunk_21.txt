The Sicilian king's sons, Polixenes and Hermione, are in love with each other. The symphony reads: The Duke of Ephesus sings: The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung By an Athenian eunuch, while Polixenes sings: The riot of the Bacchanals, Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage, and When I from Thebes comes, they are mourning the death of Learning, late deceased in beggary.
