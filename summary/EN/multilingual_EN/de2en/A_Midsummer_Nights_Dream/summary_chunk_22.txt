The Sicilian court play is ten-fold incomprehensible: For one player he kills Pyramus and then kills himself. For the other player he kills himself. The Macedonian governor, Leontes, refuses to stand on points. Instead, he orders the others to act as if he was a child on a recorder. The first one succeeds Polixenes, Thisbe, Wall , and Moonshine , who are then followed by Pyramus, Thisbe, and Lion.
