The play begins when the moonlight begins to shine in and the castle door is open. When the castle door is closed, the castle entrance is illuminated and there is a gold chain attached to the castle. When the castle door is closed, the two witches, one of them is accompanied by a guard by the name Snug, meet Pyramus and Thisby in the castle. The noise is repeated and thumps thumps thumps the thump on the tomb of Ninny's tomb to the thunderstorm of odours and rumours. When the thunderstorm breaks, a horse, a hound, a bear and a fire comes out of the tomb, followed by a raging bear and a raging dog, the thunderstorm comes out of the tomb. When the thunderstorm is overcome, the horse, the bear and the bear flee away.
