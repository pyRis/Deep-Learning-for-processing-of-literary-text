A messenger from Antigonus appears and reads a letter from his sister Cleopatra reading: Since the trees are empty , he will graff it with a medlar and bring it to the forest. Then he tells the shepherd, who is supposed to be crowned shepherd, to go with him to the promised retreat. At the same time , Antigonus praises the divine wisdom of the prophecies and urges the shepherd to go with him to the promised retreat. A messenger appears and demands that he tells CELIA who he is, while he is holding a chain around his neck and demanding that she tell him the name of the man she once wore and now has become interested in.
