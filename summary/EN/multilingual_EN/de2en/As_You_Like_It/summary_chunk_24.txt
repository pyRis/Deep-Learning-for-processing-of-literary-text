The melancholy of the Sicilian traveller is compounded by the melancholy of the melancholy of the melancholy of the two lovers. When he learns that he has sold his lands to look for another man, he declares that he is in love with his wife. The two lovers are simultaneously reproached by the Sicilian ruler ORLANDO. ORLANDO asks his wife, Rosalind, if he is not a progenitor of the goddess, if he is not a prostituted shepherd, if he is not a servant of the goddess.
