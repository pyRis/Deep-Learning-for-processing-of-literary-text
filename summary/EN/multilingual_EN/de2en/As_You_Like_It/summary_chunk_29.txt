Tonight, WILLIAM covers his head with a piece of wine, covers his face with a couple of gifs and asks Audrey if she really wants to marry him. To the dismay of those present, he tells Audrey that he has already fallen in love with the maid and asks her to abandon the society in order not to marry her. To the dismay of those present, he threatens to kill the maid if she doesn't want to marry him. In order to avoid being pursued by his master and his wife, he orders his servants to prepare an alliance for tomorrow's wedding that is attended by the Duke of Hermione and his wife Aliena.
