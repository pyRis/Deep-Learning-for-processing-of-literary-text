ORLANDO was bequeathed by his brother and taken to a cauldron of horses by his master, while his master, Adriana, keeps him at home unkept. The horses are bred by his brother, but they are taught how to feed and how to take care of them. The master, however, allows ORLANDO to keep his horses and husks with his own money. Oliver, the young son of Sir Rowland de Boys, demands from his younger brother Leonte that he should come to his funeral. He refuses, insisting that his father be expelled from his title and that he should be crowned a gentleman.
