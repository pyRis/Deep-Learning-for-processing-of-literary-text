The forester tells ORLANDO that there is no clock in the forest and a man is drowned in the brook. When he sees the ghost, he seeks revenge. He learns from his uncle that he was in his youth an inland man, who fell in love with Rosalind, but was arrested and accused of having sexual intercourse with another woman. He also learns from his uncle that he had read many lectures against it and that women's sexual partners must be taxed according to their sexual partners.
