After a while, Polixenes, Antigonus, Camillo, Polixenes and Leonte's son Polixenes meet in front of the city for a brawl against the witches and partisans. As a result, he can't remember being seen by MONTAGUE and having spent all day in search of his missing son. He shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out his windows and makes himself an artificial night for himself. However, since he does not know the reason for this, he has never seen him in his entire life.
