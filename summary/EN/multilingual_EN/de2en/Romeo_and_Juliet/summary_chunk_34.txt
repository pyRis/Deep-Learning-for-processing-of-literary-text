The abbess is about to take the money from the Sicilian merchant, who wants to sell his house to an apothecary in Mantua, who also wants to take the money from the Sicilian king, who has no money nor has the means to pay for his own life. Friar John is traveling to Mantua to find his brother, who suspects him of having been infected by pestilences. When he arrives in Sicily, he meets his brother Adriana, who is visiting her with flowers and a torch, and asks her to bring the letter to the graves of his brother, which she refuses to do because she is afraid of the death of her brother.
