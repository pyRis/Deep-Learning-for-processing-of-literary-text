The queen Anne is crowned abbey of Norfolk. First Gentleman meets her with the joy of the celebrations and says she is an angel. Then he sees the queen in front of the castle courtyard with the cloth of honour and the trumpets. The title of the palace used to be called York-place, but since the cardinal fell , it's been called Whitehall. Since then , the title has been changed to "York-place". First Gentleman remembers the two bishops: Stokesly and Gardiner, the one of Winchester, who was appointed to the position of the archbishop.
