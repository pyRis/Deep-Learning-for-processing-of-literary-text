A messenger from Antipholus tells him that the gods from his misery have sent the gold statue to live rich and happy, while painter and Poet, who is visiting Antipholus from Greece, are waiting for him in the cave. He promises that he will give the goldsmith a palm in Athens again and promise that his descendants will flourish there with the money collected from Antipholus. In search of a villain, Poet asks his servant, Timon, to appear before nightfall. When he succeeds, he reveals himself to painter and others. When the king is no longer with him , and when the two are reconciled , they meet at the baser temple , where they are celebrating the ancestors of their descendants.
