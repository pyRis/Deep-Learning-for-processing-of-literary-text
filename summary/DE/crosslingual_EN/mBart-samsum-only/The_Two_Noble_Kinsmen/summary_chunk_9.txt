und Palamon und Arcite fielen in Athens. Shall we two exercise, wie twins of honor, und feel our fiery horses. Wearthing we wear, wearthing we knee, wearthing we strive. Wearthing we strive, wearthing we strive, wearthing we strive. Wearthing we strive, wearthing we strive, wearthing we strive. Wearthing we strive, wearthing we strive. Wearthing we strive, wearthing we strive.
