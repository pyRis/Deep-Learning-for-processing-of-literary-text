Then, in order to prove their loyalty to the gods, they must choose a new king, named Emilia, who is supposed to take part in the execution of the old rebellion against the newborn kings. In order to prove his loyalty to the new king, the two figures must first take part in the execution of the old rebellion against the new kings and then against the new kings.
