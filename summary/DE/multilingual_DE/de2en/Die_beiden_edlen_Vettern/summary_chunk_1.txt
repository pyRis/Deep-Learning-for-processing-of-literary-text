In order to protect themselves from such a prophecy, the king asks the Sicilian ruler Polixenes to tell the Sicilian ruler, who is leading the rebellion against Thane of Ephesus, about the fate of his descendants. The king's sons, Antigonus and Dromio's sons, are about to execution. When they are asked to execution, the king tells them to prepare a sacrifice for the goddess, which would be attended by the whole nation, especially by the Duke of Ephesus, who fears for his position as a leading lord. He urges them to execution, while Dromio's son Flehn, who was mistaken for his own self-identification, urges the king to execution. The king then urges Dromio to execution.
