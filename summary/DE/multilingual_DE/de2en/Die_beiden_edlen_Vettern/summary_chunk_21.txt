A hungry bear kills the king and rages against his followers. When the hungry king appears, he orders them to be carried away by the bears. When the bears are killed, Antipholus, Antigonus, Polixenes, Antipholus and Polixenes meet again and fight against each other in the wilderness. The idea of murdering a beautiful woman and calling her husband Verrified Hermione even though she believes he is a deceased hepherd, raises a great deal of suspicion among those present.
