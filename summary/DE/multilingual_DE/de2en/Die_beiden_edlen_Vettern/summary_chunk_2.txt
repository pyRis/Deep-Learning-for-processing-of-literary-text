At a shepherd's festival, which is supposed to take place in Thane of Siracusa's and Hermione's honor, the Sicilian king asks the Sicilian ruler Antipholus of Hermione if he doesn't want to appear in front of the goddess of Thane of Siracusa. The king's sons, Polixenes and Hermione, fearing for their own existence, decide to flee to Theben, where they will find the goldsmith and marble statue of the goddess on Mars.
