The Sicilian king asks the Sicilian lord Antigonus of Hermione to marry the Sicilian ruler Leontes, who claims to be descended from Thane of Hermione, and to grant him the title of Thane of Hermione. In the heat of thunderstorms and thunderstorms, a messenger appears and demands from his companions that he stays away from his plan. He urges his companions to leave immediately, but the idea succeeds in vain, because he fears for his life. When he threatens to be crowned as the new king, his companion tells him to beware of his fate and to be driven to Athens by the Athenaean monacle of Hermione and Arctes.
