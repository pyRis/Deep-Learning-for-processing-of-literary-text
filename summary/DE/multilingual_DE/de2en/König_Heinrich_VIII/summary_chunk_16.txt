The Bohemian king is angry at his wife and reproaches her for the inconclusiveness of the marriage between his wife Maria and the Duke of Ephesus. However , he promises to give the marriage a proper end if it doesn't happen to be over inconspicuous , and urges the Bohemian couple to extend the marriage to another time . The meeting is overwhelmed with enthusiasm, but it is to the detriment of the king's position, which Lord Canterbury finds crippling. The English speaking , however, is still better than his English than his Late-speaking counterpart.
