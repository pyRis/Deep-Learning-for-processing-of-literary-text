The Sicilian king's court order forbids his servants from saying anything bad about his rulers and his wife. However, he allows them to say goodbye to all those who think it would be unnecessary to him. In order to be able to prove his loyalty to the king, he orders them to attend a banquet in the house of the Duke of Siracusa. The whole castle is overflowing with guests. At the same time, the king's sons, Lord Sands and Sir Thomas Lovell, are invited to a sleepover party that is supposed to be attended by the entire castle.
