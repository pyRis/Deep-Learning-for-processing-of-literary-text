The Bohemian king's court is about to confront the accusations of the Bohemian rebellion against the Bohemian king and against the Bohemian caesarean section. He suspects his wife Adriana of adultery and urges her husband for suspicion. However, he refuses to admit his guilt. He claims that he would be a better all-a-long-long-lost king if he didn't have such a fatherless childhood as Treu.
