The witches, especially Tybalt, are appalled by his witches, who persuade him to flee to Mantua with his son Romeo, when he learns that he has just fallen in love with her. The two lovers are in love with each other, but it's too late for them to tell another man about their mutual love affair, so they have to ask his wife, who lives in Paris, if she doesn't want to marry their sons. The ghost of Lady Macbeth appears in Paris, holding Capulet and the ghost of Lady Macbeth in his arms and singing at night on the Granatbaum.
