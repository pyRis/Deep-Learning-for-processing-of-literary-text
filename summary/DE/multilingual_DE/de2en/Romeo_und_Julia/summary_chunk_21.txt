The Duke of Tybalt is killed and his son, Romeo, engaged to murder him, is driven to a shepherd's sheep and driven to a shepherd's funeral, whereupon the Duke of Siracusa is pronounced deceived. Tybalts death is pronounced pronounced and pronounced pronounced, which raises the suspicions of those present about his imminent heir to the throne. The Sicilian royal court sentences the Sicilian general Bann to be expelled from his position and exonerating him for his loyalty to the Italian ruler. However, the general Bann is still arrested and pronounced the death penalty, which makes it clear to everyone: Bann is banned from his native Italy and is exonerating the Sicilian ruler from his loyalty to the Italian ruler. The Greeks can't manage to get rid of their prophecies, so they have to rely on the logic and on the imagination of their progenitors.
