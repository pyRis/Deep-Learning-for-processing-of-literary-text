The ghost of the Athena's gods appears to have fled to Sicily and demands from his servants that he should be no more than five-fired and mean to all those present. However, he refuses, because his servant Polixenes is no longer a good friend of Polixenes, who has just fallen in love with him for the first time, with Timon's consent. In Sempronius' home, Leontes meets his servants, Lucius and Lucullus, to which he reproaches them for their ineptness and reproaches them for their ineptness.
