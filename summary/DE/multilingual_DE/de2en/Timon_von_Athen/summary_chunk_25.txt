The Sicilian king Leontes sends a messenger to celebrate his ascension: a messenger tells him that he has received a goldsmith's statue from Antipholus and that his servants received gold from Antipholus and Timandra, and that Antipholus also received from Antipholus and Timon. The Duke of Ephesus meets Timon, who has just fallen in love with him, in search of his goldsmith.
