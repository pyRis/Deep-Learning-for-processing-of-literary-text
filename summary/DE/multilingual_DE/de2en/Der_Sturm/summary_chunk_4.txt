Along with the rebellion against the king, the Sicilian army and the rebellion against the witches, the Sicilian lord Leontes flees to Napel in search of his descendants. As soon as he learns that his plan to flee to the city of the witches is fulfilled, he rushes the Sicilian lord Antipholus to come to Napel, where he will be crowned as the new King of Sicily. The Sicilian king's son, Caliban, demands from Prospero that he abandons his plan in two days.
