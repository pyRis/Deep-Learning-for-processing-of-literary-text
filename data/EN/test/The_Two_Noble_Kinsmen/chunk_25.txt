Defy me in these fair terms , and you show :
More than a mistress to me . No more anger , :
As you love anything that 's honorable ! :
We were not bred to talk , man ; when we are armed :
And both upon our guards , then let our fury , :
Like meeting of two tides , fly strongly from us , :
And then to whom the birthright of this beauty :
Truly pertains--without upbraidings , scorns , :
Despisings of our persons , and such poutings , :
Fitter for girls and schoolboys--will be seen , :
And quickly , yours or mine . Will ' t please you arm , :
sir ? :
Or if you feel yourself not fitting yet :
And furnished with your old strength , I 'll stay , :
cousin , :
And ev 'ry day discourse you into health , :
As I am spared . Your person I am friends with , :
And I could wish I had not said I loved her , :
Though I had died . But loving such a lady , :
And justifying my love , I must not fly from ' t . :
PALAMON :
Arcite , thou art so brave an enemy :
That no man but thy cousin 's fit to kill thee . :
I am well and lusty . Choose your arms . :
ARCITE Choose you , sir . :
PALAMON :
Wilt thou exceed in all , or dost thou do it :
To make me spare thee ? :
ARCITE If you think so , cousin , :
You are deceived , for as I am a soldier , :
I will not spare you . :
PALAMON That 's well said . :
ARCITE You 'll find it . :
PALAMON :
Then , as I am an honest man and love :
With all the justice of affection , :
I 'll pay thee soundly . [ He chooses armor . ] :
This I 'll take . :
ARCITE [ taking the other ] That 's mine , then . :
I 'll arm you first . :
PALAMON Do . [ Arcite begins arming him . ] :
Pray thee tell me , cousin , :
Where got 'st thou this good armor ? :
ARCITE ' Tis the Duke 's , :
And to say true , I stole it . Do I pinch you ? :
PALAMON No . :
ARCITE :
Is ' t not too heavy ? :
PALAMON I have worn a lighter , :
But I shall make it serve . :
ARCITE I 'll buckle ' t close . :
PALAMON :
By any means . :
ARCITE You care not for a grand guard ? :
PALAMON :
No , no , we 'll use no horses . I perceive :
You would fain be at that fight . :
ARCITE I am indifferent . :
PALAMON :
Faith , so am I. Good cousin , thrust the buckle :
Through far enough . :
ARCITE I warrant you . :
PALAMON My casque now . :
ARCITE :
Will you fight bare-armed ? :
PALAMON We shall be the nimbler . :
ARCITE :
But use your gauntlets though . Those are o ' th ' least . :
Prithee take mine , good cousin . :
PALAMON Thank you , Arcite . :
How do I look ? Am I fall 'n much away ? :
ARCITE :
Faith , very little ; love has used you kindly . :
PALAMON :
I 'll warrant thee , I 'll strike home . :
ARCITE Do , and spare not . :
I 'll give you cause , sweet cousin . :
PALAMON Now to you , sir . :
[ He begins to arm Arcite . ] :
Methinks this armor 's very like that , Arcite , :
Thou wor 'st that day the three kings fell , but lighter . :
ARCITE :
That was a very good one , and that day , :
I well remember , you outdid me , cousin . :
I never saw such valor . When you charged :
Upon the left wing of the enemy , :
I spurred hard to come up , and under me :
I had a right good horse . :
PALAMON You had , indeed ; :
A bright bay , I remember . :
ARCITE Yes , but all :
