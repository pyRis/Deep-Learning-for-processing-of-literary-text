But that your wills have said it must be so , :
And charge me live to comfort this unfriended , :
This miserable prince , that cuts away :
A life more worthy from him than all women , :
I should and would die too . :
HIPPOLYTA Infinite pity :
That four such eyes should be so fixed on one :
That two must needs be blind for ' t . :
THESEUS So it is . :
[ Flourish . They exit . ] :
Scene 4 :
= = = = = = = :
[ Enter Guard with Palamon and his Knights , :
pinioned ; Jailer , Executioner and Others , :
carrying a block and an ax . ] :
PALAMON :
There 's many a man alive that hath outlived :
The love o ' th ' people ; yea , i ' th ' selfsame state :
Stands many a father with his child . Some comfort :
We have by so considering . We expire , :
And not without men 's pity . To live still , :
Have their good wishes ; we prevent :
The loathsome misery of age , beguile :
The gout and rheum that in lag hours attend :
For gray approachers ; we come towards the gods :
Young and unwappered , not halting under crimes :
Many and stale . That sure shall please the gods :
Sooner than such , to give us nectar with ' em , :
For we are more clear spirits . My dear kinsmen , :
Whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down , :
You have sold ' em too too cheap . :
FIRST KNIGHT What ending could be :
Of more content ? O 'er us the victors have :
Fortune , whose title is as momentary :
As to us death is certain . A grain of honor :
They not o 'er-weigh us . :
SECOND KNIGHT Let us bid farewell ; :
And with our patience anger tott 'ring Fortune , :
Who at her certain 'st reels . :
THIRD KNIGHT Come , who begins ? :
PALAMON :
E 'en he that led you to this banquet shall :
Taste to you all . [ To Jailer . ] Ah ha , my friend , my :
friend , :
Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once ; :
You 'll see ' t done now forever . Pray , how does she ? :
I heard she was not well ; her kind of ill :
Gave me some sorrow . :
JAILER Sir , she 's well restored , :
And to be married shortly . :
PALAMON By my short life , :
I am most glad on ' t . ' Tis the latest thing :
I shall be glad of ; prithee , tell her so . :
Commend me to her , and to piece her portion , :
Tender her this . [ He gives his purse to Jailer . ] :
FIRST KNIGHT Nay , let 's be offerers all . :
SECOND KNIGHT :
Is it a maid ? :
PALAMON Verily , I think so . :
A right good creature , more to me deserving :
Than I can quit or speak of . :
ALL KNIGHTS Commend us to her . :
[ They give their purses . ] :
JAILER :
The gods requite you all and make her thankful ! :
PALAMON :
Adieu , and let my life be now as short :
As my leave-taking . [ Lays his head on the block . ] :
FIRST KNIGHT Lead , courageous cousin . :
SECOND AND THIRD KNIGHTS We 'll follow cheerfully . :
[ A great noise within crying " Run ! " " Save ! " " Hold ! " :
MESSENGER :
Hold , hold ! O , hold , hold , hold ! :
[ Enter Pirithous in haste . ] :
PIRITHOUS :
Hold , ho ! It is a cursed haste you made :
If you have done so quickly ! --Noble Palamon , :
The gods will show their glory in a life :
That thou art yet to lead . :
PALAMON Can that be , :
When Venus , I have said , is false ? How do things :
fare ? :
PIRITHOUS :
Arise , great sir , and give the tidings ear :
