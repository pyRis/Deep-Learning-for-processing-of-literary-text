PALAMON :
And I have heard some call him Arcite , and-- :
ARCITE :
Out with ' t , faith . :
PALAMON She met him in an arbor . :
What did she there , coz ? Play o ' th ' virginals ? :
ARCITE :
Something she did , sir . :
PALAMON Made her groan a month :
for ' t-- :
Or two , or three , or ten . :
ARCITE The Marshal 's sister :
Had her share , too , as I remember , cousin , :
Else there be tales abroad . You 'll pledge her ? :
PALAMON Yes . :
[ He lifts his cup and then drinks . ] :
ARCITE :
A pretty brown wench ' tis . There was a time :
When young men went a-hunting , and a wood , :
And a broad beech--and thereby hangs a tale . :
Heigh ho ! :
PALAMON For Emily , upon my life ! Fool , :
Away with this strained mirth . I say again :
That sigh was breathed for Emily . Base cousin , :
Dar 'st thou break first ? :
ARCITE You are wide . :
PALAMON By heaven and :
Earth , :
There 's nothing in thee honest . :
ARCITE Then I 'll leave you . :
You are a beast now . :
PALAMON As thou mak 'st me , traitor . :
ARCITE :
There 's all things needful : files and shirts and :
perfumes . :
I 'll come again some two hours hence and bring :
That that shall quiet all . :
PALAMON A sword and armor . :
ARCITE :
Fear me not . You are now too foul . Farewell . :
Get off your trinkets ; you shall want naught . :
PALAMON Sirrah-- :
ARCITE :
I 'll hear no more . :
[ He exits . ] :
PALAMON If he keep touch , he dies for ' t . :
[ He exits . ] :

[ Enter Jailer 's Daughter . ] :
DAUGHTER :
I am very cold , and all the stars are out too , :
The little stars and all , that look like aglets . :
The sun has seen my folly.--Palamon ! :
Alas , no ; he 's in heaven . Where am I now ? :
Yonder 's the sea , and there 's a ship . How ' t tumbles ! :
And there 's a rock lies watching under water . :
Now , now , it beats upon it ; now , now , now , :
There 's a leak sprung , a sound one ! How they cry ! :
Open her before the wind ; you 'll lose all else . :
Up with a course or two , and tack about , boys ! :
Good night , good night ; you 're gone . I am very :
hungry . :
Would I could find a fine frog ; he would tell me :
News from all parts o ' th ' world ; then would I make :
A carrack of a cockleshell , and sail :
By east and northeast to the king of pygmies , :
For he tells fortunes rarely . Now my father , :
Twenty to one , is trussed up in a trice :
Tomorrow morning . I 'll say never a word . :
[ Sing . ] :
For I 'll cut my green coat a foot above my knee , :
And I 'll clip my yellow locks an inch below mine :
eye . :
Hey nonny , nonny , nonny . :
He 's buy me a white cut , forth for to ride , :
And I 'll go seek him through the world that is so :
wide . :
Hey nonny , nonny , nonny . :
O , for a prick now , like a nightingale , :
To put my breast against . I shall sleep like a top else . :
[ She exits . ] :

SCHOOLMASTER Fie , fie , what tediosity and disinsanity :
is here among you ! Have my rudiments been labored :
