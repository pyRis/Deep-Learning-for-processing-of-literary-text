Was vainly labored in me ; you outwent me , :
Nor could my wishes reach you ; yet a little :
I did by imitation . :
PALAMON More by virtue ; :
You are modest , cousin . :
ARCITE When I saw you charge first , :
Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder :
Break from the troop . :
PALAMON But still before that flew :
The lightning of your valor . Stay a little ; :
Is not this piece too strait ? :
ARCITE No , no , ' tis well . :
PALAMON :
I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword . :
A bruise would be dishonor . :
ARCITE Now I am perfect . :
PALAMON :
Stand off , then . :
ARCITE Take my sword ; I hold it better . :
PALAMON :
I thank you , no ; keep it ; your life lies on it . :
Here 's one ; if it but hold , I ask no more :
For all my hopes . My cause and honor guard me ! :
ARCITE :
And me my love ! :
[ They bow several ways , then advance and stand . ] :
Is there aught else to say ? :
PALAMON :
This only , and no more : thou art mine aunt 's son . :
And that blood we desire to shed is mutual-- :
In me thine , and in thee mine . My sword :
Is in my hand , and if thou kill 'st me , :
The gods and I forgive thee . If there be :
A place prepared for those that sleep in honor , :
I wish his weary soul that falls may win it . :
Fight bravely , cousin . Give me thy noble hand . :
ARCITE , [ as they shake hands ] :
Here , Palamon . This hand shall never more :
Come near thee with such friendship . :
PALAMON I commend thee . :
ARCITE :
If I fall , curse me , and say I was a coward , :
For none but such dare die in these just trials . :
Once more farewell , my cousin . :
PALAMON Farewell , Arcite . :
[ Fight . ] :
[ Horns within . They stand . ] :
ARCITE :
Lo , cousin , lo , our folly has undone us ! :
PALAMON Why ? :
ARCITE :
This is the Duke , a-hunting , as I told you . :
If we be found , we are wretched . O , retire , :
For honor 's sake , and safely , presently :
Into your bush again . Sir , we shall find :
Too many hours to die in . Gentle cousin , :
If you be seen , you perish instantly :
For breaking prison , and I , if you reveal me , :
For my contempt . Then all the world will scorn us , :
And say we had a noble difference , :
But base disposers of it . :
PALAMON No , no , cousin , :
I will no more be hidden , nor put off :
This great adventure to a second trial . :
I know your cunning , and I know your cause . :
He that faints now , shame take him ! Put thyself :
Upon thy present guard-- :
ARCITE You are not mad ? :
PALAMON :
Or I will make th ' advantage of this hour :
Mine own , and what to come shall threaten me :
I fear less than my fortune . Know , weak cousin , :
I love Emilia , and in that I 'll bury :
Thee and all crosses else . :
ARCITE Then come what can come , :
Thou shalt know , Palamon , I dare as well :
Die as discourse or sleep . Only this fears me : :
The law will have the honor of our ends . :
Have at thy life ! :
PALAMON Look to thine own well , Arcite . :
[ Fight again . ] :
[ Horns . Enter Theseus , Hippolyta , Emilia , :
Pirithous and train . ] :
THESEUS :
What ignorant and mad malicious traitors :
Are you , that ' gainst the tenor of my laws :
Are making battle , thus like knights appointed , :
