Why , what a question 's that ? :
ARCITE Yes , ' tis a question :
To me that know not . :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN To the games , my friend . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN :
Where were you bred , you know it not ? :
ARCITE Not far , sir . :

plum porridge ! He wrestle ? He roast eggs ! Come , :

ARCITE :
This is an offered opportunity :
I durst not wish for . Well I could have wrestled-- :
The best men called it excellent--and run :
Swifter than wind upon a field of corn , :
Curling the wealthy ears , never flew . I 'll venture , :
And in some poor disguise be there . Who knows :
Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands , :
And happiness prefer me to a place :
Where I may ever dwell in sight of her ? :

[ Enter Jailer 's Daughter , alone . ] :
DAUGHTER :
Why should I love this gentleman ? ' Tis odds :
He never will affect me . I am base , :
My father the mean keeper of his prison , :
And he a prince . To marry him is hopeless ; :
To be his whore is witless . Out upon ' t ! :
What pushes are we wenches driven to :
When fifteen once has found us ! First , I saw him ; :
I , seeing , thought he was a goodly man ; :
He has as much to please a woman in him , :
If he please to bestow it so , as ever :
These eyes yet looked on . Next , I pitied him , :
And so would any young wench , o ' my conscience , :
That ever dreamed , or vowed her maidenhead :
To a young handsome man . Then I loved him , :
Extremely loved him , infinitely loved him ! :
And yet he had a cousin , fair as he too . :
But in my heart was Palamon , and there , :
Lord , what a coil he keeps ! To hear him :
Sing in an evening , what a heaven it is ! :
And yet his songs are sad ones . Fairer spoken :
Was never gentleman . When I come in :
To bring him water in a morning , first :
He bows his noble body , then salutes me thus : :
" Fair , gentle maid , good morrow . May thy goodness :
Get thee a happy husband . " Once he kissed me ; :
I loved my lips the better ten days after . :
Would he would do so ev 'ry day ! He grieves much-- :
And me as much to see his misery . :
What should I do to make him know I love him ? :
For I would fain enjoy him . Say I ventured :
To set him free ? What says the law then ? :
Thus much for law or kindred ! I will do it , :
And this night , or tomorrow , he shall love me . :
