As any of us three ; weep ere you fail . :
Lend us a knee ; :
But touch the ground for us no longer time :
Than a dove 's motion when the head 's plucked off . :
Tell him if he i ' th ' blood-sized field lay swoll 'n , :
Showing the sun his teeth , grinning at the moon , :
What you would do . :
HIPPOLYTA Poor lady , say no more . :
I had as lief trace this good action with you :
As that whereto I am going , and never yet :
Went I so willing way . My lord is taken :
Heart-deep with your distress ; let him consider . :
I 'll speak anon . [ Second Queen rises . ] :
THIRD QUEEN O , my petition was :
Set down in ice , which by hot grief uncandied :
Melts into drops ; so sorrow , wanting form , :
Is pressed with deeper matter . :
EMILIA Pray stand up . :
Your grief is written in your cheek . :
THIRD QUEEN O , woe ! :
You cannot read it there . [ She rises . ] :
There through my tears , :
Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream , :
You may behold ' em . Lady , lady , alack ! :
He that will all the treasure know o ' th ' Earth :
Must know the center too ; he that will fish :
For my least minnow , let him lead his line :
To catch one at my heart . O , pardon me ! :
Extremity , that sharpens sundry wits , :
Makes me a fool . :
EMILIA Pray you say nothing , pray you . :
Who cannot feel nor see the rain , being in ' t , :
Knows neither wet nor dry . If that you were :
The groundpiece of some painter , I would buy you :
T ' instruct me ' gainst a capital grief--indeed , :
Such heart-pierced demonstration . But , alas , :
Being a natural sister of our sex , :
Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me :
That it shall make a counter-reflect ' gainst :
My brother 's heart and warm it to some pity , :
Though it were made of stone . Pray have good :
comfort . :
THESEUS , [ coming forward ] :
Forward to th ' temple . Leave not out a jot :
O ' th ' sacred ceremony . :
FIRST QUEEN O , this celebration :
Will longer last and be more costly than :
Your suppliants ' war . Remember that your fame :
Knolls in the ear o ' th ' world ; what you do quickly :
Is not done rashly ; your first thought is more :
Than others ' labored meditance , your premeditating :
More than their actions . But , O Jove , your actions , :
Soon as they move , as ospreys do the fish , :
Subdue before they touch . Think , dear duke , think :
What beds our slain kings have ! :
SECOND QUEEN What griefs our beds , :
That our dear lords have none ! :
THIRD QUEEN None fit for th ' dead . :
Those that with cords , knives , drams , precipitance , :
Weary of this world 's light , have to themselves :
Been death 's most horrid agents , human grace :
Affords them dust and shadow . :
FIRST QUEEN But our lords :
Lie blist 'ring ' fore the visitating sun , :
And were good kings when living . :
THESEUS :
It is true , and I will give you comfort :
To give your dead lords graves ; :
The which to do must make some work with Creon . :
FIRST QUEEN :
And that work presents itself to th ' doing . :
Now ' twill take form ; the heats are gone tomorrow . :
Then , bootless toil must recompense itself :
With its own sweat . Now he 's secure , :
Not dreams we stand before your puissance , :
Rinsing our holy begging in our eyes :
To make petition clear . :
SECOND QUEEN Now you may take him , :
Drunk with his victory . :
THIRD QUEEN And his army full :
