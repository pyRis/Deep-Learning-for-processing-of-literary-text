The Two Noble Kinsmen :
PROLOGUE :
New plays and maidenheads are near akin : :
Much followed both , for both much money giv 'n , :
If they stand sound and well . And a good play , :
Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage day :
And shake to lose his honor , is like her :
That after holy tie and first night 's stir :
Yet still is modesty , and still retains :
More of the maid , to sight , than husband 's pains . :
We pray our play may be so , for I am sure :
It has a noble breeder and a pure , :
A learned , and a poet never went :
More famous yet ' twixt Po and silver Trent . :
Chaucer , of all admired , the story gives ; :
There , constant to eternity , it lives . :
If we let fall the nobleness of this , :
And the first sound this child hear be a hiss , :
How will it shake the bones of that good man :
And make him cry from underground " O , fan :
From me the witless chaff of such a writer :
That blasts my bays and my famed works makes :
lighter :
Than Robin Hood ! " This is the fear we bring ; :
For , to say truth , it were an endless thing :
And too ambitious , to aspire to him , :
Weak as we are , and , almost breathless , swim :
In this deep water . Do but you hold out :
Your helping hands , and we shall tack about :
And something do to save us . You shall hear :
Scenes , though below his art , may yet appear :
Worth two hours ' travel . To his bones sweet sleep ; :
Content to you . If this play do not keep :
A little dull time from us , we perceive :
Our losses fall so thick we must needs leave . :

[ Music . Enter Hymen with a torch burning , a Boy in :
a white robe before , singing and strewing flowers . :
After Hymen , a Nymph encompassed in her tresses , :
bearing a wheaten garland ; then Theseus between :
two other Nymphs with wheaten chaplets on their :
heads . Then Hippolyta , the bride , led by Pirithous , :
and another holding a garland over her head , her :
tresses likewise hanging . After her , Emilia , holding :
up her train . Then Artesius and Attendants . ] :
The Song , sung by the Boy . :
Roses , their sharp spines being gone , :
Not royal in their smells alone , :
But in their hue ; :
Maiden pinks , of odor faint , :
Daisies smell-less , yet most quaint , :
And sweet thyme true ; :
Primrose , firstborn child of Ver , :
Merry springtime 's harbinger , :
With her bells dim ; :
Oxlips in their cradles growing , :
Marigolds on deathbeds blowing , :
Lark 's-heels trim ; :
All dear Nature 's children sweet :
Lie ' fore bride and bridegroom 's feet , :
[ Strew flowers . ] :
Blessing their sense . :
Not an angel of the air , :
Bird melodious or bird fair , :
Is absent hence . :
The crow , the sland 'rous cuckoo , nor :
The boding raven , nor chough hoar , :
Nor chatt 'ring pie , :
May on our bridehouse perch or sing , :
Or with them any discord bring , :
But from it fly . :
[ Enter three Queens in black , with veils stained , with :
imperial crowns . The first Queen falls down at the foot :
of Theseus ; the second falls down at the foot of :
Hippolyta ; the third before Emilia . ] :
FIRST QUEEN , [ to Theseus ] :
For pity 's sake and true gentility 's , :
Hear and respect me . :
SECOND QUEEN , [ to Hippolyta ] For your mother 's sake , :
