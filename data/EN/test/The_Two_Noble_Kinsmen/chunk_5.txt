To dangle ' t in my hand , or to go tiptoe :
Before the street be foul ? Either I am :
The forehorse in the team , or I am none :
That draw i ' th ' sequent trace . These poor slight :
sores :
Need not a plantain . That which rips my bosom :
Almost to th ' heart 's-- :
ARCITE Our Uncle Creon . :
PALAMON He . :
A most unbounded tyrant , whose successes :
Makes heaven unfeared and villainy assured :
Beyond its power there 's nothing ; almost puts :
Faith in a fever , and deifies alone :
Voluble chance ; who only attributes :
The faculties of other instruments :
To his own nerves and act ; commands men service , :
And what they win in ' t , boot and glory ; one :
That fears not to do harm ; good , dares not . Let :
The blood of mine that 's sib to him be sucked :
From me with leeches ; let them break and fall :
Off me with that corruption . :
ARCITE Clear-spirited cousin , :
Let 's leave his court , that we may nothing share :
Of his loud infamy ; for our milk :
Will relish of the pasture , and we must :
Be vile or disobedient , not his kinsmen :
In blood unless in quality . :
PALAMON Nothing truer . :
I think the echoes of his shames have deafed :
The ears of heav 'nly justice . Widows ' cries :
Descend again into their throats and have not :
Due audience of the gods . :
[ Enter Valerius . ] :
Valerius . :
VALERIUS :
The King calls for you ; yet be leaden-footed :
Till his great rage be off him . Phoebus , when :
He broke his whipstock and exclaimed against :
The horses of the sun , but whispered to :
The loudness of his fury . :
PALAMON Small winds shake him . :
But what 's the matter ? :
VALERIUS :
Theseus , who where he threats appalls , hath sent :
Deadly defiance to him and pronounces :
Ruin to Thebes , who is at hand to seal :
The promise of his wrath . :
ARCITE Let him approach . :
But that we fear the gods in him , he brings not :
A jot of terror to us . Yet what man :
Thirds his own worth--the case is each of ours-- :
When that his action 's dregged with mind assured :
'Tis bad he goes about ? :
PALAMON Leave that unreasoned . :
Our services stand now for Thebes , not Creon . :
Yet to be neutral to him were dishonor , :
Rebellious to oppose . Therefore we must :
With him stand to the mercy of our fate , :
Who hath bounded our last minute . :
ARCITE So we must . :
[ To Valerius . ] Is ' t said this war 's afoot ? Or , it shall :
be , :
On fail of some condition ? :
VALERIUS ' Tis in motion ; :
The intelligence of state came in the instant :
With the defier . :
PALAMON Let 's to the King , who , were he :
A quarter carrier of that honor which :
His enemy come in , the blood we venture :
Should be as for our health , which were not spent , :
Rather laid out for purchase . But alas , :
Our hands advanced before our hearts , what will :
The fall o ' th ' stroke do damage ? :
ARCITE Let th ' event , :
That never-erring arbitrator , tell us :
When we know all ourselves , and let us follow :
The becking of our chance . :
[ They exit . ] :

[ Enter Pirithous , Hippolyta , Emilia . ] :
PIRITHOUS :
No further . :
HIPPOLYTA Sir , farewell . Repeat my wishes :
To our great lord , of whose success I dare not :
Make any timorous question ; yet I wish him :
Excess and overflow of power , an ' t might be , :
To dure ill-dealing fortune . Speed to him . :
Store never hurts good governors . :
PIRITHOUS Though I know :
