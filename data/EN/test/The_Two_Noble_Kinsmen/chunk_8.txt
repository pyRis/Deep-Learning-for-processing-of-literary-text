Desire of liberty , a fever , madness , :
Hath set a mark which nature could not reach to :
Without some imposition , sickness in will :
O 'er-wrestling strength in reason . For our love :
And great Apollo 's mercy , all our best :
Their best skill tender.--Lead into the city , :
Where , having bound things scattered , we will post :
To Athens ' fore our army . :

[ Music . Enter the Queens with the hearses of their :
knights , in a funeral solemnity , & c . ] :
The dirge . :
Urns and odors bring away ; :
Vapors , sighs , darken the day ; :
Our dole more deadly looks than dying ; :
Balms and gums and heavy cheers , :
Sacred vials filled with tears , :
And clamors through the wild air flying . :
Come , all sad and solemn shows :
That are quick-eyed Pleasure 's foes ; :
We convent naught else but woes . :

THIRD QUEEN , [ to Second Queen ] :
This funeral path brings to your household 's grave . :
Joy seize on you again ; peace sleep with him . :
SECOND QUEEN , [ to First Queen ] :
And this to yours . :
FIRST QUEEN , [ to Third Queen ] Yours this way . Heavens :

A thousand differing ways to one sure end . :
THIRD QUEEN :
This world 's a city full of straying streets , :
And death 's the market-place where each one meets . :

[ Enter Jailer and Wooer . ] :
JAILER I may depart with little while I live ; something I :
may cast to you , not much . Alas , the prison I keep , :
though it be for great ones , yet they seldom come ; :
before one salmon you shall take a number of minnows . :
I am given out to be better lined than it can :
appear to me report is a true speaker . I would I :

JAILER Well , we will talk more of this when the solemnity :

DAUGHTER By my troth , I think fame but stammers :
'em . They stand a grise above the reach of report . :
JAILER I heard them reported in the battle to be the :
