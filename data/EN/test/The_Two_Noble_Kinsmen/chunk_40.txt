DOCTOR Go , go . :
You fathers are fine fools . Her honesty ? :
And we should give her physic till we find that ! :
WOOER :
Why , do you think she is not honest , sir ? :
DOCTOR :
How old is she ? :
WOOER She 's eighteen . :
DOCTOR She may be . :
But that 's all one ; ' tis nothing to our purpose . :
Whate 'er her father says , if you perceive :
Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of , :
Videlicet , the way of flesh--you have me ? :
WOOER :
Yes , very well , sir . :
DOCTOR Please her appetite , :
And do it home ; it cures her , ipso facto , :
The melancholy humor that infects her . :
WOOER :
I am of your mind , doctor . :
DOCTOR You 'll find it so . :
[ Enter Jailer , Daughter , and Maid . ] :
She comes ; pray humor her . :
[ Wooer and Doctor stand aside . ] :
JAILER , [ to Daughter ] :
Come , your love Palamon stays for you , child , :
And has done this long hour , to visit you . :
DAUGHTER :
I thank him for his gentle patience . :
He 's a kind gentleman , and I am much bound to :
him . :
Did you ne 'er see the horse he gave me ? :
JAILER Yes . :
DAUGHTER :
How do you like him ? :
JAILER He 's a very fair one . :
DAUGHTER :
You never saw him dance ? :
JAILER No . :
DAUGHTER I have , often . :
He dances very finely , very comely , :
And for a jig , come cut and long tail to him , :
He turns you like a top . :
JAILER That 's fine indeed . :
DAUGHTER :
He 'll dance the morris twenty mile an hour , :
And that will founder the best hobbyhorse , :
If I have any skill , in all the parish , :
And gallops to the tune of " Light o ' love . " :
What think you of this horse ? :
JAILER Having these virtues , :
I think he might be brought to play at tennis . :
DAUGHTER :
Alas , that 's nothing . :
JAILER Can he write and read too ? :
DAUGHTER :
A very fair hand , and casts himself th ' accounts :
Of all his hay and provender . That hostler :
Must rise betime that cozens him . You know :
The chestnut mare the Duke has ? :
JAILER Very well . :
DAUGHTER :
She is horribly in love with him , poor beast , :
But he is like his master , coy and scornful . :
JAILER :
What dowry has she ? :
DAUGHTER Some two hundred bottles , :
And twenty strike of oats , but he 'll ne 'er have her . :
He lisps in ' s neighing able to entice :
A miller 's mare . He 'll be the death of her . :
DOCTOR , [ aside ] What stuff she utters ! :
[ Wooer and Doctor come forward . ] :
JAILER :
Make curtsy ; here your love comes . :
WOOER Pretty soul , :
How do you ? [ Daughter curtsies . ] :
That 's a fine maid ; there 's a curtsy ! :
DAUGHTER :
Yours to command i ' th ' way of honesty.-- :
How far is ' t now to th ' end o ' th ' world , my masters ? :
DOCTOR :
Why , a day 's journey , wench . :
DAUGHTER , [ to Wooer ] Will you go with me ? :
WOOER :
What shall we do there , wench ? :
DAUGHTER Why , play at :
stool-ball . :
What is there else to do ? :
WOOER I am content , :
If we shall keep our wedding there . :
DAUGHTER ' Tis true , :
For there , I will assure you , we shall find :
Some blind priest for the purpose , that will venture :
To marry us ; for here they are nice and foolish . :
