That the true love ' tween maid and maid may be :
More than in sex individual . :
HIPPOLYTA You 're out of breath , :
And this high-speeded pace is but to say :
That you shall never--like the maid Flavina-- :
Love any that 's called man . :
EMILIA I am sure I shall not . :
HIPPOLYTA Now , alack , weak sister , :
I must no more believe thee in this point-- :
Though in ' t I know thou dost believe thyself-- :
Than I will trust a sickly appetite , :
That loathes even as it longs . But sure , my sister , :
If I were ripe for your persuasion , you :
Have said enough to shake me from the arm :
Of the all-noble Theseus , for whose fortunes :
I will now in and kneel , with great assurance :
That we , more than his Pirithous , possess :
The high throne in his heart . :
EMILIA I am not :
Against your faith , yet I continue mine . :
[ They exit . ] :
Scene 4 :
= = = = = = = :
[ Cornets . A battle struck within ; then a retreat . :
Flourish . Then enter , through one door , Theseus , :
victor , accompanied by Lords and Soldiers . :
Entering through another door , the three Queens :
meet him , and fall on their faces before him . ] :
FIRST QUEEN :
To thee no star be dark ! :
SECOND QUEEN Both heaven and Earth :
Friend thee forever . :
THIRD QUEEN All the good that may :
Be wished upon thy head , I cry " Amen " to ' t ! :
THESEUS :
Th ' impartial gods , who from the mounted heavens :
View us their mortal herd , behold who err :
And , in their time , chastise . Go and find out :
The bones of your dead lords and honor them :
With treble ceremony ; rather than a gap :
Should be in their dear rites , we would supply ' t ; :
But those we will depute which shall invest :
You in your dignities and even each thing :
Our haste does leave imperfect . So , adieu , :
And heaven 's good eyes look on you . [ Queens exit . ] :
[ Enter a Herald and Soldiers bearing Palamon :
and Arcite on biers . ] :
What are those ? :
HERALD :
Men of great quality , as may be judged :
By their appointment . Some of Thebes have told ' s :
They are sisters ' children , nephews to the King . :
THESEUS :
By th ' helm of Mars , I saw them in the war , :
Like to a pair of lions , smeared with prey , :
Make lanes in troops aghast . I fixed my note :
Constantly on them , for they were a mark :
Worth a god 's view . What prisoner was ' t that told me :
When I enquired their names ? :
HERALD Wi ' leave , they 're called :
Arcite and Palamon . :
THESEUS ' Tis right ; those , those . :
They are not dead ? :
HERALD :
Nor in a state of life . Had they been taken :
When their last hurts were given , ' twas possible :
They might have been recovered . Yet they breathe :
And have the name of men . :
THESEUS Then like men use ' em . :
The very lees of such , millions of rates , :
Exceed the wine of others . All our surgeons :
Convent in their behoof ; our richest balms , :
Rather than niggard , waste . Their lives concern us :
Much more than Thebes is worth . Rather than have :
'em :
Freed of this plight , and in their morning state , :
Sound and at liberty , I would ' em dead . :
But forty-thousandfold we had rather have ' em :
Prisoners to us than Death . Bear ' em speedily :
From our kind air , to them unkind , and minister :
What man to man may do--for our sake , more , :
Since I have known frights , fury , friends ' behests , :
