And chop on some cold thought ! Thrice blessed :
chance :
To drop on such a mistress , expectation :
Most guiltless on ' t . Tell me , O Lady Fortune , :
Next after Emily my sovereign , how far :
I may be proud . She takes strong note of me , :
Hath made me near her ; and this beauteous morn , :
The prim 'st of all the year , presents me with :
A brace of horses ; two such steeds might well :
Be by a pair of kings backed , in a field :
That their crowns ' titles tried . Alas , alas , :
Poor cousin Palamon , poor prisoner , thou :
So little dream 'st upon my fortune that :
Thou think 'st thyself the happier thing , to be :
So near Emilia ; me thou deem 'st at Thebes , :
And therein wretched , although free . But if :
Thou knew 'st my mistress breathed on me , and that :
I eared her language , lived in her eye--O coz , :
What passion would enclose thee ! :
[ Enter Palamon as out of a bush , with his shackles ; :
he bends his fist at Arcite . ] :
PALAMON Traitor kinsman , :
Thou shouldst perceive my passion if these signs :
Of prisonment were off me , and this hand :
But owner of a sword . By all oaths in one , :
I and the justice of my love would make thee :
A confessed traitor , O thou most perfidious :
That ever gently looked , the void 'st of honor :
That e 'er bore gentle token , falsest cousin :
That ever blood made kin ! Call 'st thou her thine ? :
I 'll prove it in my shackles , with these hands , :
Void of appointment , that thou liest , and art :
A very thief in love , a chaffy lord , :
Nor worth the name of villain . Had I a sword , :
And these house clogs away-- :
ARCITE Dear cousin Palamon-- :
PALAMON :
Cozener Arcite , give me language such :
As thou hast showed me feat . :
ARCITE Not finding in :
The circuit of my breast any gross stuff :
To form me like your blazon holds me to :
This gentleness of answer : ' tis your passion :
That thus mistakes , the which , to you being enemy , :
Cannot to me be kind . Honor and honesty :
I cherish and depend on , howsoe 'er :
You skip them in me , and with them , fair coz , :
I 'll maintain my proceedings . Pray be pleased :
To show in generous terms your griefs , since that :
Your question 's with your equal , who professes :
To clear his own way with the mind and sword :
Of a true gentleman . :
PALAMON That thou durst , Arcite ! :
ARCITE :
My coz , my coz , you have been well advertised :
How much I dare ; you 've seen me use my sword :
Against th ' advice of fear . Sure , of another :
You would not hear me doubted , but your silence :
Should break out , though i ' th ' sanctuary . :
PALAMON Sir , :
I have seen you move in such a place which well :
Might justify your manhood ; you were called :
A good knight and a bold . But the whole week 's not :
fair :
If any day it rain ; their valiant temper :
Men lose when they incline to treachery , :
And then they fight like compelled bears--would fly :
Were they not tied . :
ARCITE Kinsman , you might as well :
Speak this and act it in your glass as to :
His ear which now disdains you . :
PALAMON Come up to me ; :
Quit me of these cold gyves , give me a sword :
Though it be rusty , and the charity :
Of one meal lend me . Come before me then , :
A good sword in thy hand , and do but say :
That Emily is thine , I will forgive :
The trespass thou hast done me--yea , my life , :
