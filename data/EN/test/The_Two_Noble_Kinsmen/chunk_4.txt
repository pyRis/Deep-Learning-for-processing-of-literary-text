Ere you can end this feast , of which I pray you :
Make no abatement.--Once more , farewell all . :
[ All but Theseus and the Queens exit . ] :
FIRST QUEEN :
Thus dost thou still make good the tongue o ' th ' :
world . :
SECOND QUEEN :
And earn 'st a deity equal with Mars . :
THIRD QUEEN If not above him , for :
Thou , being but mortal , makest affections bend :
To godlike honors ; they themselves , some say , :
Groan under such a mast 'ry . :
THESEUS As we are men , :
Thus should we do ; being sensually subdued , :
We lose our human title . Good cheer , ladies . :
Now turn we towards your comforts . :
[ Flourish . They exit . ] :
Scene 2 :

[ Enter Palamon and Arcite . ] :
ARCITE :
Dear Palamon , dearer in love than blood :
And our prime cousin , yet unhardened in :
The crimes of nature , let us leave the city :
Thebes , and the temptings in ' t , before we further :
Sully our gloss of youth , :
And here to keep in abstinence we shame :
As in incontinence ; for not to swim :
I ' th ' aid o ' th ' current were almost to sink , :
At least to frustrate striving ; and to follow :
The common stream , ' twould bring us to an eddy :
Where we should turn or drown ; if labor through , :
Our gain but life and weakness . :
PALAMON Your advice :
Is cried up with example . What strange ruins , :
Since first we went to school , may we perceive :
Walking in Thebes ! Scars and bare weeds :
The gain o ' th ' martialist , who did propound :
To his bold ends honor and golden ingots , :
Which though he won , he had not , and now flirted :
By peace for whom he fought . Who then shall offer :
To Mars 's so-scorned altar ? I do bleed :
When such I meet , and wish great Juno would :
Resume her ancient fit of jealousy :
To get the soldier work , that peace might purge :
For her repletion , and retain anew :
Her charitable heart , now hard and harsher :
Than strife or war could be . :
ARCITE Are you not out ? :
Meet you no ruin but the soldier in :
The cranks and turns of Thebes ? You did begin :
As if you met decays of many kinds . :
Perceive you none that do arouse your pity :
But th ' unconsidered soldier ? :
PALAMON Yes , I pity :
Decays where 'er I find them , but such most :
That , sweating in an honorable toil , :
Are paid with ice to cool ' em . :
ARCITE ' Tis not this :
I did begin to speak of . This is virtue :
Of no respect in Thebes . I spake of Thebes-- :
How dangerous , if we will keep our honors , :
It is for our residing , where every evil :
Hath a good color ; where every seeming good 's :
A certain evil ; where not to be e 'en jump :
As they are here were to be strangers , and , :
Such things to be , mere monsters . :
PALAMON ' Tis in our power-- :
Unless we fear that apes can tutor ' s--to :
Be masters of our manners . What need I :
Affect another 's gait , which is not catching :
Where there is faith ? Or to be fond upon :
Another 's way of speech , when by mine own :
I may be reasonably conceived--saved too , :
Speaking it truly ? Why am I bound :
By any generous bond to follow him :
Follows his tailor , haply so long until :
The followed make pursuit ? Or let me know :
Why mine own barber is unblessed , with him :
My poor chin too , for ' tis not scissored just :
To such a favorite 's glass ? What canon is there :
That does command my rapier from my hip :
