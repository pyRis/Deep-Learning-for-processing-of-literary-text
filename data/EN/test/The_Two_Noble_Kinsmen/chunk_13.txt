ARCITE Do ! :
JAILER :
By your leave , gentlemen . :
PALAMON Now , honest keeper ? :
JAILER :
Lord Arcite , you must presently to th ' Duke ; :
The cause I know not yet . :
ARCITE I am ready , keeper . :
JAILER :
Prince Palamon , I must awhile bereave you :
Of your fair cousin 's company . :
[ Arcite and Jailer exit . ] :
PALAMON And me too , :
Even when you please , of life.--Why is he sent for ? :
It may be he shall marry her ; he 's goodly , :
And like enough the Duke hath taken notice :
Both of his blood and body . But his falsehood ! :
Why should a friend be treacherous ? If that :
Get him a wife so noble and so fair , :
Let honest men ne 'er love again . Once more :
I would but see this fair one . Blessed garden :
And fruit and flowers more blessed that still :
blossom :
As her bright eyes shine on you , would I were , :
For all the fortune of my life hereafter , :
Yon little tree , yon blooming apricock ! :
How I would spread and fling my wanton arms :
In at her window ; I would bring her fruit :
Fit for the gods to feed on ; youth and pleasure :
Still as she tasted should be doubled on her ; :
And , if she be not heavenly , I would make her :
So near the gods in nature , they should fear her . :
[ Enter Jailer , above . ] :
And then I am sure she would love me.--How now , :
keeper , :
Where 's Arcite ? :
JAILER Banished . Prince Pirithous :
Obtained his liberty , but never more :
Upon his oath and life must he set foot :
Upon this kingdom . :
PALAMON He 's a blessed man . :
He shall see Thebes again , and call to arms :
The bold young men that , when he bids ' em charge , :
Fall on like fire . Arcite shall have a fortune , :
If he dare make himself a worthy lover , :
Yet in the field to strike a battle for her , :
And , if he lose her then , he 's a cold coward . :
How bravely may he bear himself to win her :
If he be noble Arcite--thousand ways ! :
Were I at liberty , I would do things :
Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady , :
This blushing virgin , should take manhood to her :
And seek to ravish me . :
JAILER My lord , for you :
I have this charge to-- :
PALAMON To discharge my life ? :
JAILER :
No , but from this place to remove your Lordship ; :
The windows are too open . :
PALAMON Devils take ' em :
That are so envious to me ! Prithee , kill me . :
JAILER :
And hang for ' t afterward ! :
PALAMON By this good light , :
Had I a sword I would kill thee . :
JAILER Why , my lord ? :
PALAMON :
Thou bringst such pelting , scurvy news continually , :
Thou art not worthy life . I will not go . :
JAILER :
Indeed you must , my lord . :
PALAMON May I see the garden ? :
JAILER :
No . :
PALAMON Then I am resolved , I will not go . :
JAILER :
I must constrain you then ; and , for you are :
dangerous , :
I 'll clap more irons on you . :
PALAMON Do , good keeper . :
I 'll shake ' em so , you shall not sleep ; :
I 'll make you a new morris . Must I go ? :
JAILER :
There is no remedy . :
PALAMON Farewell , kind window . :
May rude wind never hurt thee . O , my lady , :
If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was , :
Dream how I suffer.--Come ; now bury me . :
