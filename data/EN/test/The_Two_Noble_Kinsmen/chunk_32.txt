DAUGHTER There is at least two hundred now with :
child by him--there must be four ; yet I keep close :
for all this , close as a cockle ; and all these must be :
boys--he has the trick on ' t--and at ten years old :
they must be all gelt for musicians and sing the :
wars of Theseus . :
SECOND FRIEND This is strange . :
DAUGHTER As ever you heard , but say nothing . :
FIRST FRIEND No . :
DAUGHTER They come from all parts of the dukedom :
to him ; I 'll warrant you , he had not so few last :
night as twenty to dispatch . He 'll tickle ' t up in two :
hours , if his hand be in . :
JAILER , [ aside ] She 's lost past all cure . :
BROTHER Heaven forbid , man ! :
DAUGHTER , [ to Jailer ] Come hither ; you are a wise :
man . :
FIRST FRIEND , [ aside ] Does she know him ? :
SECOND FRIEND No ; would she did . :
DAUGHTER You are master of a ship ? :
JAILER Yes . :
DAUGHTER Where 's your compass ? :
JAILER Here . :
DAUGHTER Set it to th ' north . And now direct your :
course to th ' wood , where Palamon lies longing for :
me . For the tackling , let me alone.--Come , weigh , :
my hearts , cheerly . :
ALL , [ as if sailing a ship ] Owgh , owgh , owgh ! -- ' Tis up ! :
The wind 's fair ! --Top the bowline ! --Out with the :
main sail ! Where 's your whistle , master ? :
BROTHER Let 's get her in ! :
JAILER Up to the top , boy ! :
BROTHER Where 's the pilot ? :
FIRST FRIEND Here . :
DAUGHTER What kenn 'st thou ? :
SECOND FRIEND A fair wood . :
DAUGHTER Bear for it , master . Tack about ! :

Scene 2 :
= = = = = = = :
[ Enter Emilia alone , with two pictures . ] :
EMILIA :
Yet I may bind those wounds up that must open :
And bleed to death for my sake else . I 'll choose , :
And end their strife . Two such young handsome men :
Shall never fall for me ; their weeping mothers , :
Following the dead cold ashes of their sons , :
Shall never curse my cruelty . :
[ Looks at one of the pictures . ] :
Good heaven , :
What a sweet face has Arcite ! If wise Nature , :
With all her best endowments , all those beauties :
She sows into the births of noble bodies , :
Were here a mortal woman , and had in her :
The coy denials of young maids , yet doubtless :
She would run mad for this man . What an eye , :
Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness , :
Has this young prince ! Here Love himself sits :
smiling ; :
Just such another wanton Ganymede :
Set Jove afire with , and enforced the god :
Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him , :
A shining constellation . What a brow , :
Of what a spacious majesty , he carries , :
Arched like the great-eyed Juno 's but far sweeter , :
Smoother than Pelops ' shoulder ! Fame and Honor , :
Methinks , from hence as from a promontory :
Pointed in heaven , should clap their wings and sing :
To all the under world the loves and fights :
Of gods and such men near ' em . :
[ Looks at the other picture . ] :
Palamon :
Is but his foil , to him a mere dull shadow ; :
He 's swart and meager , of an eye as heavy :
As if he had lost his mother ; a still temper , :
No stirring in him , no alacrity ; :
Of all this sprightly sharpness not a smile . :
Yet these that we count errors may become him ; :
