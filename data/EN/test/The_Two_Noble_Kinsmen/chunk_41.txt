For there , I will assure you , we shall find :
Some blind priest for the purpose , that will venture :
To marry us ; for here they are nice and foolish . :
Besides , my father must be hanged tomorrow , :
And that would be a blot i ' th ' business . :
Are not you Palamon ? :
WOOER Do not you know me ? :
DAUGHTER :
Yes , but you care not for me ; I have nothing :
But this poor petticoat and two coarse smocks . :
WOOER :
That 's all one ; I will have you . :
DAUGHTER Will you surely ? :
WOOER , [ taking her hand ] :
Yes , by this fair hand , will I. :
DAUGHTER We 'll to bed then . :
WOOER :
E 'en when you will . [ He kisses her . ] :
DAUGHTER , [ wiping her face ] O , sir , you would fain :
be nibbling . :
WOOER :
Why do you rub my kiss off ? :
DAUGHTER ' Tis a sweet one , :
And will perfume me finely against the wedding . :
Is not this your cousin Arcite ? [ She indicates Doctor . ] :
DOCTOR Yes , sweetheart , :
And I am glad my cousin Palamon :
Has made so fair a choice . :
DAUGHTER Do you think he 'll have me ? :
DOCTOR :
Yes , without doubt . :
DAUGHTER , [ to Jailer ] Do you think so too ? :
JAILER Yes . :
DAUGHTER :
We shall have many children . [ ( To Doctor . ) ] Lord , :
how you 're grown ! :
My Palamon , I hope , will grow too , finely , :
Now he 's at liberty . Alas , poor chicken , :
He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging , :
But I 'll kiss him up again . :
[ Enter a Messenger . ] :
MESSENGER :
What do you here ? You 'll lose the noblest sight :
That e 'er was seen . :
JAILER Are they i ' th ' field ? :
MESSENGER They are . :
You bear a charge there too . :
JAILER I 'll away straight.-- :
I must e 'en leave you here . :
DOCTOR Nay , we 'll go with you . :
I will not lose the sight . :
JAILER , [ aside to Doctor ] How did you like her ? :
DOCTOR :
I 'll warrant you , within these three or four days :
I 'll make her right again . [ Jailer and Messenger exit . ] :
[ ( To Wooer . ) ] You must not from her , :
But still preserve her in this way . :
WOOER I will . :
DOCTOR :
Let 's get her in . :
WOOER Come , sweet , we 'll go to dinner :
And then we 'll play at cards . :
DAUGHTER And shall we kiss too ? :
WOOER :
A hundred times . :
DAUGHTER And twenty . :
WOOER Ay , and twenty . :
DAUGHTER :
And then we 'll sleep together . :
DOCTOR , [ to Wooer ] Take her offer . :
WOOER :
Yes , marry , will we . :
DAUGHTER But you shall not hurt me . :
WOOER :
I will not , sweet . :
DAUGHTER If you do , love , I 'll cry . :
[ They exit . ] :
Scene 3 :

[ Flourish . Enter Theseus , Hippolyta , :
Emilia , Pirithous , and some Attendants . ] :
EMILIA :
I 'll no step further . :
PIRITHOUS Will you lose this sight ? :
EMILIA :
I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly :
Than this decision ; ev 'ry blow that falls :
Threats a brave life ; each stroke laments :
The place whereon it falls , and sounds more like :
A bell than blade . I will stay here . :
It is enough my hearing shall be punished :
With what shall happen , ' gainst the which there is :
No deafing but to hear ; not taint mine eye :
With dread sights it may shun . :
PIRITHOUS , [ to Theseus ] Sir , my good lord , :
