Both sealed with eye and ear.--You must be present ; :
You are the victor 's meed , the price and garland :
To crown the question 's title . :
EMILIA Pardon me . :
If I were there , I 'd wink . :
THESEUS You must be there ; :
This trial is as ' twere i ' th ' night , and you :
The only star to shine . :
EMILIA I am extinct ; :
There is but envy in that light which shows :
The one the other . Darkness , which ever was :
The dam of horror , who does stand accursed :
Of many mortal millions , may even now , :
By casting her black mantle over both , :
That neither could find other , get herself :
Some part of a good name , and many a murder :
Set off whereto she 's guilty . :
HIPPOLYTA You must go . :
EMILIA :
In faith , I will not . :
THESEUS Why , the knights must kindle :
Their valor at your eye . Know , of this war :
You are the treasure , and must needs be by :
To give the service pay . :
EMILIA Sir , pardon me . :
The title of a kingdom may be tried :
Out of itself . :
THESEUS Well , well , then ; at your pleasure . :
Those that remain with you could wish their office :
To any of their enemies . :
HIPPOLYTA Farewell , sister . :
I am like to know your husband ' fore yourself :
By some small start of time . He whom the gods :
Do of the two know best , I pray them he :
Be made your lot . :
[ Theseus , Hippolyta , Pirithous , and others , :
exit . Emilia remains , comparing again :
the pictures of Arcite and Palamon . ] :
EMILIA :
Arcite is gently visaged , yet his eye :
Is like an engine bent , or a sharp weapon :
In a soft sheath ; mercy and manly courage :
Are bedfellows in his visage . Palamon :
Has a most menacing aspect ; his brow :
Is graved , and seems to bury what it frowns on ; :
Yet sometimes ' tis not so , but alters to :
The quality of his thoughts . Long time his eye :
Will dwell upon his object . Melancholy :
Becomes him nobly ; so does Arcite 's mirth ; :
But Palamon 's sadness is a kind of mirth , :
So mingled , as if mirth did make him sad :
And sadness merry . Those darker humors that :
Stick misbecomingly on others , on them :
Live in fair dwelling . :
[ Cornets . Trumpets sound as to a charge . ] :
Hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite :
The princes to their proof ! Arcite may win me , :
And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to :
The spoiling of his figure . O , what pity :
Enough for such a chance ? If I were by , :
I might do hurt , for they would glance their eyes :
Towards my seat , and in that motion might :
Omit a ward or forfeit an offense :
Which craved that very time . :
[ Cornets . A great cry and noise :
within crying " A Palamon ! " ] :
It is much better :
I am not there . O , better never born :
Than minister to such harm ! :
[ Enter Servant . ] :
What is the chance ? :
SERVANT The cry 's " A Palamon . " :
EMILIA Then he has won . ' Twas ever likely . :
He looked all grace and success , and he is :
Doubtless the prim 'st of men . I prithee run :
And tell me how it goes . :
[ Shout and cornets , crying " A Palamon ! " ] :
SERVANT Still " Palamon . " :
EMILIA :
Run and inquire . [ Servant exits . ] :
[ Addressing Arcite 's picture . ] Poor servant , thou hast :
lost . :
Upon my right side still I wore thy picture , :
Palamon 's on the left--why so , I know not . :
