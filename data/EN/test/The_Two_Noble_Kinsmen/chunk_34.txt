THESEUS :
Pray speak him , friend . :
PIRITHOUS I guess he is a prince too , :
And , if it may be , greater ; for his show :
Has all the ornament of honor in ' t : :
He 's somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of , :
But of a face far sweeter ; his complexion :
Is , as a ripe grape , ruddy . He has felt :
Without doubt what he fights for , and so apter :
To make this cause his own . In ' s face appears :
All the fair hopes of what he undertakes , :
And when he 's angry , then a settled valor , :
Not tainted with extremes , runs through his body :
And guides his arm to brave things . Fear he cannot ; :
He shows no such soft temper . His head 's yellow , :
Hard-haired and curled , thick-twined like ivy tods , :
Not to undo with thunder . In his face :
The livery of the warlike maid appears , :
Pure red and white , for yet no beard has blessed him . :
And in his rolling eyes sits Victory , :
As if she ever meant to crown his valor . :
His nose stands high , a character of honor ; :
His red lips , after fights , are fit for ladies . :
EMILIA :
Must these men die too ? :
PIRITHOUS When he speaks , his tongue :
Sounds like a trumpet . All his lineaments :
Are as a man would wish ' em , strong and clean . :
He wears a well-steeled axe , the staff of gold ; :
His age some five-and-twenty . :
MESSENGER There 's another-- :
A little man , but of a tough soul , seeming :
As great as any ; fairer promises :
In such a body yet I never looked on . :
PIRITHOUS :
O , he that 's freckle-faced ? :
MESSENGER The same , my lord . :
Are they not sweet ones ? :
PIRITHOUS Yes , they are well . :
MESSENGER Methinks , :
Being so few , and well disposed , they show :
Great and fine art in nature . He 's white-haired-- :
Not wanton white , but such a manly color :
Next to an auburn ; tough and nimble-set , :
Which shows an active soul . His arms are brawny , :
Lined with strong sinews--to the shoulder-piece :
Gently they swell , like women new-conceived , :
Which speaks him prone to labor , never fainting :
Under the weight of arms ; stout-hearted still , :
But when he stirs , a tiger . He 's grey-eyed , :
Which yields compassion where he conquers ; sharp :
To spy advantages , and where he finds ' em , :
He 's swift to make ' em his . He does no wrongs , :
Nor takes none . He 's round-faced , and when he :
smiles :
He shows a lover ; when he frowns , a soldier . :
About his head he wears the winner 's oak , :
And in it stuck the favor of his lady . :
His age some six-and-thirty . In his hand :
He bears a charging-staff embossed with silver . :
THESEUS :
Are they all thus ? :
PIRITHOUS They are all the sons of honor . :
THESEUS :
Now , as I have a soul , I long to see ' em.-- :
Lady , you shall see men fight now . :
HIPPOLYTA I wish it , :
But not the cause , my lord . They would show :
Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms ; :
'Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.-- :
O , my soft-hearted sister , what think you ? :
Weep not till they weep blood . Wench , it must be . :
THESEUS , [ to Emilia ] :
You have steeled ' em with your beauty . [ ( To :
Pirithous . ) ] Honored friend , :
To you I give the field ; pray order it :
Fitting the persons that must use it . :
PIRITHOUS Yes , sir . :
THESEUS :
Come , I 'll go visit ' em . I cannot stay-- :
Their fame has fired me so--till they appear . :
