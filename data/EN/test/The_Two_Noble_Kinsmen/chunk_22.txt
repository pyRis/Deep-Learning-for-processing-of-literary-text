figure , even the very plum broth and marrow of :
my understanding laid upon you , and do you still :
cry " Where ? " and " How ? " and " Wherefore ? " You :
most coarse-frieze capacities , you jean judgments , :
have I said " Thus let be " and " There let be " :
and " Then let be " and no man understand me ? Proh :
deum , medius fidius , you are all dunces ! Forwhy , :
here stand I ; here the Duke comes ; there are you , :
close in the thicket ; the Duke appears ; I meet him :
and unto him I utter learned things and many figures ; :
he hears , and nods , and hums , and then cries :
" Rare ! " and I go forward . At length I fling my cap :
up--mark there ! Then do you as once did Meleager :
and the boar--break comely out before him ; :
like true lovers , cast yourselves in a body decently , :
and sweetly , by a figure , trace and turn , boys . :
FIRST COUNTRYMAN And sweetly we will do it , Master :
Gerald . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN Draw up the company . Where 's :
the taborer ? :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN Why , Timothy ! :
[ Enter the Taborer . ] :
TABORER Here , my mad boys . Have at you ! :
SCHOOLMASTER But I say , where 's their women ? :
[ Enter five Wenches . ] :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN Here 's Fritz and Maudlin . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN And little Luce with the white :
legs , and bouncing Barbary . :
FIRST COUNTRYMAN And freckled Nell , that never failed :
her master . :
SCHOOLMASTER Where be your ribbons , maids ? Swim :
with your bodies , and carry it sweetly and deliverly , :
and now and then a favor and a frisk . :
NELL Let us alone , sir . :
SCHOOLMASTER Where 's the rest o ' th ' music ? :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN Dispersed , as you commanded . :
SCHOOLMASTER Couple , then , and see what 's wanting . :
Where 's the Bavian ? --My friend , carry your tail :
without offense or scandal to the ladies ; and be :
sure you tumble with audacity and manhood , and :
when you bark , do it with judgment . :
BAVIAN Yes , sir . :
SCHOOLMASTER Quo usque tandem ? Here is a woman :
wanting . :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN We may go whistle ; all the fat 's i ' :
th ' fire . :
SCHOOLMASTER We have , as learned authors utter , :
washed a tile ; we have been fatuus and labored :
vainly . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN This is that scornful piece , that :
scurvy hilding that gave her promise faithfully she :
would be here--Cicely , the sempster 's daughter . :
The next gloves that I give her shall be dogskin ; :
nay , an she fail me once--you can tell , Arcas , she :
swore by wine and bread she would not break . :
SCHOOLMASTER An eel and woman , a learned poet :
says , unless by th ' tail and with thy teeth thou hold , :
will either fail . In manners , this was false :
position . :
FIRST COUNTRYMAN A fire ill take her ! Does she flinch :
now ? :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN What shall we determine , sir ? :
SCHOOLMASTER Nothing . Our business is become a :
nullity , yea , and a woeful and a piteous nullity . :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN Now , when the credit of our town :
lay on it , now to be frampold , now to piss o ' th ' :
nettle ! Go thy ways ; I 'll remember thee . I 'll fit :
thee ! :
[ Enter Jailer 's Daughter . ] :
DAUGHTER , [ sings ] :
The George Alow came from the south , :
From the coast of Barbary-a , :
And there he met with brave gallants of war , :
By one , by two , by three-a . :
" Well hailed , well hailed , you jolly gallants , :
And whither now are you bound-a ? :
