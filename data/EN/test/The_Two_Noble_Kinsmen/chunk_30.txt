Of your name or his ' scape . :
JAILER Pray heaven it hold so . :
[ Enter Second Friend . ] :
SECOND FRIEND :
Be of good comfort , man ; I bring you news , :
Good news . :
JAILER They are welcome . :
SECOND FRIEND Palamon has cleared :
you :
And got your pardon , and discovered how :
And by whose means he escaped , which was your :
daughter 's , :
Whose pardon is procured too ; and the prisoner , :
Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness , :
Has given a sum of money to her marriage-- :
A large one , I 'll assure you . :
JAILER You are a good man :
And ever bring good news . :
FIRST FRIEND How was it ended ? :
SECOND FRIEND :
Why , as it should be : they that ne 'er begged :
But they prevailed had their suits fairly granted ; :
The prisoners have their lives . :
FIRST FRIEND I knew ' twould be so . :
SECOND FRIEND :
But there be new conditions , which you 'll hear of :
At better time . :
JAILER I hope they are good . :
SECOND FRIEND They are :
honorable ; :
How good they 'll prove I know not . :
FIRST FRIEND ' Twill be known . :
[ Enter Wooer . ] :
WOOER :
Alas , sir , where 's your daughter ? :
JAILER Why do you ask ? :
WOOER :
O , sir , when did you see her ? :
SECOND FRIEND , [ aside ] How he looks ! :
JAILER :
This morning . :
WOOER Was she well ? Was she in health ? :
Sir , when did she sleep ? :
FIRST FRIEND , [ aside ] These are strange questions . :
JAILER :
I do not think she was very well--for now :
You make me mind her ; but this very day :
I asked her questions , and she answered me :
So far from what she was , so childishly , :
So sillily , as if she were a fool , :
An innocent , and I was very angry . :
But what of her , sir ? :
WOOER Nothing but my pity ; :
But you must know it , and as good by me :
As by another that less loves her . :
JAILER Well , sir ? :
WOOER :
No , sir , not well . :
FIRST FRIEND Not right ? :
SECOND FRIEND Not well ? :
WOOER :
'Tis too true ; she is mad . :
FIRST FRIEND It cannot be . :
WOOER :
Believe you 'll find it so . :
JAILER I half suspected :
What you told me . The gods comfort her ! :
Either this was her love to Palamon , :
Or fear of my miscarrying on his ' scape , :
Or both . :
WOOER ' Tis likely . :
JAILER But why all this haste , sir ? :
WOOER :
I 'll tell you quickly . As I late was angling :
In the great lake that lies behind the palace , :
From the far shore--thick set with reeds and :
sedges-- :
As patiently I was attending sport , :
I heard a voice , a shrill one ; and , attentive , :
I gave my ear , when I might well perceive :
'Twas one that sung , and by the smallness of it :
A boy or woman . I then left my angle :
To his own skill , came near , but yet perceived not :
Who made the sound , the rushes and the reeds :
Had so encompassed it . I laid me down :
And listened to the words she sung , for then , :
Through a small glade cut by the fishermen , :
I saw it was your daughter . :
JAILER Pray go on , sir . :
WOOER :
She sung much , but no sense ; only I heard her :
Repeat this often : " Palamon is gone , :
Is gone to th ' wood to gather mulberries ; :
I 'll find him out tomorrow . " :
FIRST FRIEND Pretty soul ! :
WOOER :
