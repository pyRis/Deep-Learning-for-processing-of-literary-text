A cripple flourish with his crutch , and cure him :
Before Apollo ; that mayst force the king :
To be his subject 's vassal , and induce :
Stale gravity to dance . The polled bachelor , :
Whose youth , like wanton boys through bonfires , :
Have skipped thy flame , at seventy thou canst catch , :
And make him , to the scorn of his hoarse throat , :
Abuse young lays of love . What godlike power :
Hast thou not power upon ? To Phoebus thou :
Add 'st flames hotter than his ; the heavenly fires :
Did scorch his mortal son , thine him . The huntress , :
All moist and cold , some say , began to throw :
Her bow away and sigh . Take to thy grace :
Me , thy vowed soldier , who do bear thy yoke :
As ' twere a wreath of roses , yet is heavier :
Than lead itself , stings more than nettles . :
I have never been foul-mouthed against thy law , :
Ne 'er revealed secret , for I knew none--would not , :
Had I kenned all that were . I never practiced :
Upon man 's wife , nor would the libels read :
Of liberal wits . I never at great feasts :
Sought to betray a beauty , but have blushed :
At simp 'ring sirs that did . I have been harsh :
To large confessors , and have hotly asked them :
If they had mothers--I had one , a woman , :
And women ' twere they wronged . I knew a man :
Of eighty winters--this I told them--who :
A lass of fourteen brided ; ' twas thy power :
To put life into dust . The aged cramp :
Had screwed his square foot round ; :
The gout had knit his fingers into knots ; :
Torturing convulsions from his globy eyes :
Had almost drawn their spheres , that what was life :
In him seemed torture . This anatomy :
Had by his young fair fere a boy , and I :
Believed it was his , for she swore it was , :
And who would not believe her ? Brief , I am :
To those that prate and have done , no companion ; :
To those that boast and have not , a defier ; :
To those that would and cannot , a rejoicer . :
Yea , him I do not love that tells close offices :
The foulest way , nor names concealments in :
The boldest language . Such a one I am , :
And vow that lover never yet made sigh :
Truer than I. O , then , most soft sweet goddess , :
Give me the victory of this question , which :
Is true love 's merit , and bless me with a sign :
Of thy great pleasure . :
[ Here music is heard ; doves are :
seen to flutter . They fall again upon :
their faces , then on their knees . ] :
O thou that from eleven to ninety reign 'st :
In mortal bosoms , whose chase is this world :
And we in herds thy game , I give thee thanks :
For this fair token , which being laid unto :
Mine innocent true heart , arms in assurance :
My body to this business.--Let us rise :
And bow before the goddess . [ They rise and bow . ] :
Time comes on . :
[ They exit . ] :
[ Still music of recorders . Enter Emilia in white , her :
hair about her shoulders , wearing a wheaten wreath ; :
one in white holding up her train , her hair stuck with :
flowers ; one before her carrying a silver hind , in which :
is conveyed incense and sweet odors , which being :
set upon the altar of Diana , her maids standing :
aloof , she sets fire to it . Then they curtsy and kneel . ] :
EMILIA :
O sacred , shadowy , cold , and constant queen , :
Abandoner of revels , mute contemplative , :
Sweet , solitary , white as chaste , and pure :
As wind-fanned snow , who to thy female knights :
Allow 'st no more blood than will make a blush , :
