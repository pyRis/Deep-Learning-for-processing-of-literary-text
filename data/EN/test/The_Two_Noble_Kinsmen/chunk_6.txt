His ocean needs not my poor drops , yet they :
Must yield their tribute there.--My precious maid , :
Those best affections that the heavens infuse :
In their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned :
In your dear heart ! :
EMILIA Thanks , sir . Remember me :
To our all-royal brother , for whose speed :
The great Bellona I 'll solicit ; and :
Since in our terrene state petitions are not :
Without gifts understood , I 'll offer to her :
What I shall be advised she likes . Our hearts :
Are in his army , in his tent . :
HIPPOLYTA In ' s bosom . :
We have been soldiers , and we cannot weep :
When our friends don their helms or put to sea , :
Or tell of babes broached on the lance , or women :
That have sod their infants in--and after ate them-- :
The brine they wept at killing ' em . Then if :
You stay to see of us such spinsters , we :
Should hold you here forever . :
PIRITHOUS Peace be to you :
As I pursue this war , which shall be then :
Beyond further requiring . [ Pirithous exits . ] :
EMILIA How his longing :
Follows his friend ! Since his depart , his sports , :
Though craving seriousness and skill , passed slightly :
His careless execution , where nor gain :
Made him regard , or loss consider , but :
Playing one business in his hand , another :
Directing in his head , his mind nurse equal :
To these so diff 'ring twins . Have you observed him :
Since our great lord departed ? :
HIPPOLYTA With much labor , :
And I did love him for ' t . They two have cabined :
In many as dangerous as poor a corner , :
Peril and want contending ; they have skiffed :
Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power :
I ' th ' least of these was dreadful , and they have :
Fought out together where Death 's self was lodged . :
Yet fate hath brought them off . Their knot of love , :
Tied , weaved , entangled , with so true , so long , :
And with a finger of so deep a cunning , :
May be outworn , never undone . I think :
Theseus cannot be umpire to himself , :
Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing :
Each side like justice , which he loves best . :
EMILIA Doubtless :
There is a best , and reason has no manners :
To say it is not you . I was acquainted :
Once with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow ; :
You were at wars when she the grave enriched , :
Who made too proud the bed ; took leave o ' th ' moon , :
Which then looked pale at parting , when our count :
Was each eleven . :
HIPPOLYTA ' Twas Flavina . :
EMILIA Yes . :
You talk of Pirithous ' and Theseus ' love . :
Theirs has more ground , is more maturely seasoned , :
More buckled with strong judgment , and their needs :
The one of th ' other may be said to water :
Their intertangled roots of love . But I , :
And she I sigh and spoke of , were things innocent , :
Loved for we did , and like the elements :
That know not what nor why , yet do effect :
Rare issues by their operance , our souls :
Did so to one another . What she liked :
Was then of me approved , what not , condemned , :
No more arraignment . The flower that I would pluck :
And put between my breasts--O , then but beginning :
To swell about the blossom--she would long :
Till she had such another , and commit it :
To the like innocent cradle , where , Phoenix-like , :
They died in perfume . On my head no toy :
But was her pattern ; her affections--pretty , :
Though haply hers careless were--I followed :
For my most serious decking . Had mine ear :
Stol 'n some new air , or at adventure hummed one :
From musical coinage , why , it was a note :
Whereon her spirits would sojourn--rather , dwell :
on-- :
