Am humbled ' fore thine altar . O , vouchsafe :
With that thy rare green eye , which never yet :
Beheld thing maculate , look on thy virgin , :
And , sacred silver mistress , lend thine ear-- :
Which ne 'er heard scurrile term , into whose port :
Ne 'er entered wanton sound--to my petition , :
Seasoned with holy fear . This is my last :
Of vestal office . I am bride-habited :
But maiden-hearted . A husband I have ' pointed , :
But do not know him . Out of two I should :
Choose one , and pray for his success , but I :
Am guiltless of election . Of mine eyes , :
Were I to lose one--they are equal precious-- :
I could doom neither ; that which perished should :
Go to ' t unsentenced . Therefore , most modest queen , :
He of the two pretenders that best loves me :
And has the truest title in ' t , let him :
Take off my wheaten garland , or else grant :
The file and quality I hold I may :
Continue in thy band . :
[ Here the hind vanishes under the :
altar , and in the place ascends a rose :
tree , having one rose upon it . ] :
See what our general of ebbs and flows :
Out from the bowels of her holy altar :
With sacred act advances : but one rose . :
If well inspired , this battle shall confound :
Both these brave knights , and I , a virgin flower , :
Must grow alone unplucked . :
[ Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments , :
and the rose falls from the tree . ] :
The flower is fall 'n , the tree descends . O mistress , :
Thou here dischargest me . I shall be gathered ; :
I think so , but I know not thine own will . :
Unclasp thy mystery ! --I hope she 's pleased ; :
Her signs were gracious . :
[ They curtsy and exit . ] :
Scene 2 :

[ Enter Doctor , Jailer , and Wooer in :
the habit of Palamon . ] :
DOCTOR :
Has this advice I told you done any good upon her ? :
WOOER :
O , very much . The maids that kept her company :
Have half-persuaded her that I am Palamon ; :
Within this half-hour she came smiling to me , :
And asked me what I would eat , and when I would :
kiss her . :
I told her " Presently , " and kissed her twice . :
DOCTOR :
'Twas well done ; twenty times had been far better , :
For there the cure lies mainly . :
WOOER Then she told me :
She would watch with me tonight , for well she knew :
What hour my fit would take me . :
DOCTOR Let her do so , :
And when your fit comes , fit her home , :
And presently . :
WOOER She would have me sing . :
DOCTOR :
You did so ? :
WOOER No . :
DOCTOR ' Twas very ill done , then . :
You should observe her ev 'ry way . :
WOOER Alas , :
I have no voice , sir , to confirm her that way . :
DOCTOR :
That 's all one , if you make a noise . :
If she entreat again , do anything . :
Lie with her , if she ask you . :
JAILER Ho there , doctor ! :
DOCTOR :
Yes , in the way of cure . :
JAILER But first , by your leave , :
I ' th ' way of honesty . :
DOCTOR That 's but a niceness . :
Ne 'er cast your child away for honesty . :
Cure her first this way ; then if she will be honest , :
She has the path before her . :
JAILER :
Thank you , doctor . :
DOCTOR Pray bring her in :
And let 's see how she is . :
JAILER I will , and tell her :
Her Palamon stays for her . But , doctor , :
