Is gone to th ' wood to gather mulberries ; :
I 'll find him out tomorrow . " :
FIRST FRIEND Pretty soul ! :
WOOER :
" His shackles will betray him ; he 'll be taken , :
And what shall I do then ? I 'll bring a bevy , :
A hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do , :
With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies , :
With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses , :
And all we 'll dance an antic ' fore the Duke , :
And beg his pardon . " Then she talked of you , sir-- :
That you must lose your head tomorrow morning , :
And she must gather flowers to bury you , :
And see the house made handsome . Then she sung :
Nothing but " Willow , willow , willow , " and between :
Ever was " Palamon , fair Palamon , " :
And " Palamon was a tall young man . " The place :
Was knee-deep where she sat ; her careless tresses , :
A wreath of bulrush rounded ; about her stuck :
Thousand freshwater flowers of several colors , :
That methought she appeared like the fair nymph :
That feeds the lake with waters , or as Iris :
Newly dropped down from heaven . Rings she made :
Of rushes that grew by , and to ' em spoke :
The prettiest posies : " Thus our true love 's tied , " :
" This you may lose , not me , " and many a one ; :
And then she wept , and sung again , and sighed , :
And with the same breath smiled and kissed her :
hand . :
SECOND FRIEND :
Alas , what pity it is ! :
WOOER I made in to her . :
She saw me , and straight sought the flood . I saved :
her :
And set her safe to land , when presently :
She slipped away , and to the city made :
With such a cry and swiftness that , believe me , :
She left me far behind her . Three or four :
I saw from far off cross her--one of ' em :
I knew to be your brother--where she stayed :
And fell , scarce to be got away . I left them with her :
And hither came to tell you . :
[ Enter Jailer 's Brother , Jailer 's Daughter , and others . ] :
Here they are . :
DAUGHTER , [ sings ] :
May you never more enjoy the light , etc . :
Is not this a fine song ? :
BROTHER O , a very fine one . :
DAUGHTER I can sing twenty more . :
BROTHER I think you can . :
DAUGHTER Yes , truly can I. I can sing " The Broom " :
and " Bonny Robin . " Are not you a tailor ? :
BROTHER Yes . :
DAUGHTER Where 's my wedding gown ? :
BROTHER I 'll bring it tomorrow . :
DAUGHTER Do , very rarely , I must be abroad else to :
call the maids and pay the minstrels , for I must :
lose my maidenhead by cocklight . ' Twill never :
thrive else . :
[ Sings . ] O fair , O sweet , etc . :
BROTHER , [ to Jailer ] You must e 'en take it patiently . :
JAILER ' Tis true . :
DAUGHTER Good e 'en , good men . Pray , did you ever :
hear of one young Palamon ? :
JAILER Yes , wench , we know him . :
DAUGHTER Is ' t not a fine young gentleman ? :
JAILER ' Tis , love . :
BROTHER , [ aside to others ] By no mean cross her ; she :
is then distempered far worse than now she :
shows . :
FIRST FRIEND , [ to Daughter ] Yes , he 's a fine man . :
DAUGHTER O , is he so ? You have a sister . :
FIRST FRIEND Yes . :
DAUGHTER But she shall never have him--tell her so-- :
for a trick that I know ; you 'd best look to her , for :
if she see him once , she 's gone , she 's done and :
undone in an hour . All the young maids of our :
