in disguise , with a garland , Attendants , and others . ] :
THESEUS , [ to Arcite ] :
You have done worthily . I have not seen , :
Since Hercules , a man of tougher sinews . :
Whate 'er you are , you run the best and wrestle :
That these times can allow . :
ARCITE I am proud to please you . :
THESEUS :
What country bred you ? :
ARCITE This ; but far off , prince . :
THESEUS :
Are you a gentleman ? :
ARCITE My father said so , :
And to those gentle uses gave me life . :
THESEUS :
Are you his heir ? :
ARCITE His youngest , sir . :
THESEUS Your father , :
Sure , is a happy sire , then . What proves you ? :
ARCITE :
A little of all noble qualities . :
I could have kept a hawk and well have hallowed :
To a deep cry of dogs . I dare not praise :
My feat in horsemanship , yet they that knew me :
Would say it was my best piece . Last , and greatest , :
I would be thought a soldier . :
THESEUS You are perfect . :
PIRITHOUS :
Upon my soul , a proper man . :
EMILIA He is so . :
PIRITHOUS , [ to Hippolyta ] :
How do you like him , lady ? :
HIPPOLYTA I admire him . :
I have not seen so young a man so noble , :
If he say true , of his sort . :
EMILIA Believe , :
His mother was a wondrous handsome woman ; :
His face , methinks , goes that way . :
HIPPOLYTA But his body :
And fiery mind illustrate a brave father . :
PIRITHOUS :
Mark how his virtue , like a hidden sun , :
Breaks through his baser garments . :
HIPPOLYTA He 's well got , sure . :
THESEUS , [ to Arcite ] :
What made you seek this place , sir ? :
ARCITE Noble Theseus , :
To purchase name and do my ablest service :
To such a well-found wonder as thy worth ; :
For only in thy court , of all the world , :
Dwells fair-eyed Honor . :
PIRITHOUS All his words are worthy . :
THESEUS :
Sir , we are much indebted to your travel , :
Nor shall you lose your wish.--Pirithous , :
Dispose of this fair gentleman . :
PIRITHOUS Thanks , Theseus.-- :
Whate 'er you are , you 're mine , and I shall give you :
To a most noble service : to this lady , :
This bright young virgin . :
[ He brings Arcite to Emilia . ] :
Pray observe her goodness ; :
You have honored her fair birthday with your :
virtues , :
And , as your due , you 're hers . Kiss her fair hand , sir . :
ARCITE :
Sir , you 're a noble giver.--Dearest beauty , :
Thus let me seal my vowed faith . :
[ He kisses her hand . ] :
When your servant , :
Your most unworthy creature , but offends you , :
Command him die , he shall . :
EMILIA That were too cruel . :
If you deserve well , sir , I shall soon see ' t . :
You 're mine , and somewhat better than your rank :
I 'll use you . :
PIRITHOUS , [ to Arcite ] :
I 'll see you furnished , and because you say :
You are a horseman , I must needs entreat you :
This afternoon to ride--but ' tis a rough one . :
ARCITE :
I like him better , prince ; I shall not then :
Freeze in my saddle . :
THESEUS , [ to Hippolyta ] Sweet , you must be ready , -- :
And you , Emilia , --and you , friend , --and all , :
Tomorrow by the sun , to do observance :
To flowery May in Dian 's wood.--Wait well , sir , :
Upon your mistress.--Emily , I hope :
He shall not go afoot . :
EMILIA That were a shame , sir , :
While I have horses.--Take your choice , and what :
