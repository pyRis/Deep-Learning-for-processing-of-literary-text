Against another , arm oppressed by arm , :
I would destroy th ' offender , coz--I would :
Though parcel of myself . Then from this gather :
How I should tender you . :
ARCITE I am in labor :
To push your name , your ancient love , our kindred :
Out of my memory , and i ' th ' selfsame place :
To seat something I would confound . So hoist we :
The sails that must these vessels port even where :
The heavenly Limiter pleases . :
PALAMON You speak well . :
Before I turn , let me embrace thee , cousin . :
[ They embrace . ] :
This I shall never do again . :
ARCITE One farewell . :
PALAMON :
Why , let it be so . Farewell , coz . :
ARCITE Farewell , sir . :
[ Palamon and his Knights exit . ] :
Knights , kinsmen , lovers , yea , my sacrifices , :
True worshippers of Mars , whose spirit in you :
Expels the seeds of fear and th ' apprehension :
Which still is father of it , go with me :
Before the god of our profession . There :
Require of him the hearts of lions and :
The breath of tigers , yea , the fierceness too , :
Yea , the speed also--to go on , I mean ; :
Else wish we to be snails . You know my prize :
Must be dragged out of blood ; force and great feat :
Must put my garland on , where she sticks , :
The queen of flowers . Our intercession , then , :
Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern :
Brimmed with the blood of men . Give me your aid , :
And bend your spirits towards him . :
[ They go to Mars 's altar , fall on :
their faces before it , and then kneel . ] :
Thou mighty one , that with thy power hast turned :
Green Neptune into purple , whose approach :
Comets prewarn , whose havoc in vast field :
Unearthed skulls proclaim , whose breath blows :
down :
The teeming Ceres ' foison , who dost pluck :
With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds :
The masoned turrets , that both mak 'st and break 'st :
The stony girths of cities ; me thy pupil , :
Youngest follower of thy drum , instruct this day :
With military skill , that to thy laud :
I may advance my streamer , and by thee :
Be styled the lord o ' th ' day . Give me , great Mars , :
Some token of thy pleasure . :
[ Here they fall on their faces as formerly , and :
there is heard clanging of armor , with a short :
thunder , as the burst of a battle , whereupon :
they all rise and bow to the altar . ] :
O , great corrector of enormous times , :
Shaker of o 'er-rank states , thou grand decider :
Of dusty and old titles , that heal 'st with blood :
The Earth when it is sick , and cur 'st the world :
O ' th ' pleurisy of people , I do take :
Thy signs auspiciously , and in thy name :
To my design march boldly.--Let us go . [ They exit . ] :
[ Enter Palamon and his Knights , :
with the former observance . ] :
PALAMON :
Our stars must glister with new fire , or be :
Today extinct . Our argument is love , :
Which , if the goddess of it grant , she gives :
Victory too . Then blend your spirits with mine , :
You whose free nobleness do make my cause :
Your personal hazard . To the goddess Venus :
Commend we our proceeding , and implore :
Her power unto our party . :
[ Here they go to Venus 's altar , fall on :
their faces before it , and then kneel . ] :
Hail , sovereign queen of secrets , who hast power :
To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage :
And weep unto a girl ; that hast the might :
Even with an eye-glance to choke Mars 's drum :
