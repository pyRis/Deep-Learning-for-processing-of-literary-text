The Chambermaid and Servingman by night :
That seek out silent hanging ; then mine Host :
And his fat Spouse , that welcomes to their cost :
The galled traveler , and with a beck 'ning :
Informs the tapster to inflame the reck 'ning ; :
Then the beest-eating Clown ; and next the Fool , :
The Bavian with long tail and eke long tool , :
Cum multis aliis that make a dance ; :
Say " ay , " and all shall presently advance . :
THESEUS :
Ay , ay , by any means , dear Domine . :
PIRITHOUS Produce ! :
SCHOOLMASTER :
Intrate , filii . Come forth and foot it . :
[ Music . Enter the Countrymen , Countrywomen , and :
Jailer 's Daughter ; they perform a morris dance . ] :
SCHOOLMASTER :
Ladies , if we have been merry :
And have pleased ye with a derry , :
And a derry and a down , :
Say the Schoolmaster 's no clown.-- :
Duke , if we have pleased thee too :
And have done as good boys should do , :
Give us but a tree or twain :
For a Maypole , and again , :
Ere another year run out , :
We 'll make thee laugh , and all this rout . :
THESEUS :
Take twenty , Domine.--How does my sweetheart ? :
HIPPOLYTA :
Never so pleased , sir . :
EMILIA ' Twas an excellent dance , :
And , for a preface , I never heard a better . :
THESEUS :
Schoolmaster , I thank you.--One see ' em all :
rewarded . [ An Attendant gives money . ] :
PIRITHOUS :
And here 's something to paint your pole withal . :
[ He gives money . ] :
THESEUS Now to our sports again . :
SCHOOLMASTER :
May the stag thou hunt 'st stand long , :
And thy dogs be swift and strong ; :
May they kill him without lets , :
And the ladies eat his dowsets . :
[ Wind horns within . Theseus , Hippolyta , :
Emilia , Pirithous , and Train exit . ] :
Come , we are all made . Dii deaeque omnes , :
You have danced rarely , wenches . :
[ They exit . ] :
Scene 6 :

[ Enter Palamon from the bush . ] :
PALAMON :
About this hour my cousin gave his faith :
To visit me again , and with him bring :
Two swords and two good armors . If he fail , :
He 's neither man nor soldier . When he left me , :
I did not think a week could have restored :
My lost strength to me , I was grown so low :
And crestfall 'n with my wants . I thank thee , Arcite , :
Thou art yet a fair foe , and I feel myself , :
With this refreshing , able once again :
To outdure danger . To delay it longer :
Would make the world think , when it comes to :
hearing , :
That I lay fatting like a swine to fight :
And not a soldier . Therefore , this blest morning :
Shall be the last ; and that sword he refuses , :
If it but hold , I kill him with . ' Tis justice . :
So , love and fortune for me ! :
[ Enter Arcite with armors and swords . ] :
O , good morrow . :
ARCITE :
Good morrow , noble kinsman . :
PALAMON I have put you :
To too much pains , sir . :
ARCITE That too much , fair cousin , :
Is but a debt to honor and my duty . :
PALAMON :
Would you were so in all , sir ; I could wish you :
As kind a kinsman as you force me find :
A beneficial foe , that my embraces :
Might thank you , not my blows . :
ARCITE I shall think either , :
Well done , a noble recompense . :
PALAMON Then I shall quit you . :
ARCITE :
Defy me in these fair terms , and you show :
More than a mistress to me . No more anger , :
