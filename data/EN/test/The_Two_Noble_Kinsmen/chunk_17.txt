If you serve faithfully , I dare assure you :
You 'll find a loving mistress . :
ARCITE If I do not , :
Let me find that my father ever hated , :
Disgrace and blows . :
THESEUS Go lead the way ; you have won it . :
It shall be so ; you shall receive all dues :
Fit for the honor you have won . ' Twere wrong else.-- :
Sister , beshrew my heart , you have a servant :
That , if I were a woman , would be master ; :
But you are wise . :
EMILIA I hope too wise for that , sir . :

Scene 6 :

[ Enter Jailer 's Daughter alone . ] :
DAUGHTER :
Let all the dukes and all the devils roar ! :
He is at liberty . I have ventured for him , :
And out I have brought him ; to a little wood :
A mile hence I have sent him , where a cedar :
Higher than all the rest spreads like a plane :
Fast by a brook , and there he shall keep close :
Till I provide him files and food , for yet :
His iron bracelets are not off . O Love , :
What a stout-hearted child thou art ! My father :
Durst better have endured cold iron than done it . :
I love him beyond love and beyond reason :
Or wit or safety . I have made him know it ; :
I care not , I am desperate . If the law :
Find me and then condemn me for ' t , some wenches , :
Some honest-hearted maids , will sing my dirge :
And tell to memory my death was noble , :
Dying almost a martyr . That way he takes :
I purpose is my way too . Sure he cannot :
Be so unmanly as to leave me here . :
If he do , maids will not so easily :
Trust men again . And yet he has not thanked me :
For what I have done ; no , not so much as kissed me , :
And that , methinks , is not so well ; nor scarcely :
Could I persuade him to become a free man , :
He made such scruples of the wrong he did :
To me and to my father . Yet I hope , :
When he considers more , this love of mine :
Will take more root within him . Let him do :
What he will with me , so he use me kindly ; :
For use me so he shall , or I 'll proclaim him , :
And to his face , no man . I 'll presently :
Provide him necessaries and pack my clothes up , :
And where there is a path of ground I 'll venture , :
So he be with me . By him like a shadow :
I 'll ever dwell . Within this hour the hubbub :
Will be all o 'er the prison . I am then :
Kissing the man they look for . Farewell , father ! :
Get many more such prisoners and such daughters , :
And shortly you may keep yourself . Now to him . :

[ Cornets in sundry places . Noise and hallowing :
as people a-Maying . Enter Arcite alone . ] :
ARCITE :
The Duke has lost Hippolyta ; each took :
A several laund . This is a solemn rite :
They owe bloomed May , and the Athenians pay it :
To th ' heart of ceremony . O Queen Emilia , :
Fresher than May , sweeter :
Than her gold buttons on the boughs , or all :
Th ' enameled knacks o ' th ' mead or garden--yea , :
We challenge too the bank of any nymph :
That makes the stream seem flowers ; thou , O jewel :
O ' th ' wood , o ' th ' world , hast likewise blessed a pace :
With thy sole presence . In thy rumination :
