PALAMON He 's a villain , then . :
PIRITHOUS These are men ! :
ARCITE :
No , never , duke . ' Tis worse to me than begging :
To take my life so basely ; though I think :
I never shall enjoy her , yet I 'll preserve :
The honor of affection , and die for her , :
Make death a devil ! :
THESEUS :
What may be done ? For now I feel compassion . :
PIRITHOUS :
Let it not fall again , sir . :
THESEUS Say , Emilia , :
If one of them were dead , as one must , are you :
Content to take th ' other to your husband ? :
They cannot both enjoy you . They are princes :
As goodly as your own eyes , and as noble :
As ever fame yet spoke of . Look upon ' em , :
And , if you can love , end this difference . :
I give consent.--Are you content too , princes ? :
BOTH :
With all our souls . :
THESEUS He that she refuses :
Must die then . :
BOTH Any death thou canst invent , duke . :
PALAMON :
If I fall from that mouth , I fall with favor , :
And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes . :
ARCITE :
If she refuse me , yet my grave will wed me , :
And soldiers sing my epitaph . :
THESEUS , [ to Emilia ] Make choice , then . :
EMILIA :
I cannot , sir ; they are both too excellent . :
For me , a hair shall never fall of these men . :
HIPPOLYTA :
What will become of ' em ? :
THESEUS Thus I ordain it-- :
And , by mine honor , once again , it stands , :
Or both shall die : you shall both to your country , :
And each within this month , accompanied :
With three fair knights , appear again in this place , :
In which I 'll plant a pyramid ; and whether , :
Before us that are here , can force his cousin :
By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar , :
He shall enjoy her ; the other lose his head , :
And all his friends ; nor shall he grudge to fall , :
Nor think he dies with interest in this lady . :
Will this content you ? :
PALAMON Yes.--Here , Cousin Arcite , :
I am friends again till that hour . [ He offers his hand . ] :
ARCITE I embrace you . :
[ They shake hands . ] :
THESEUS :
Are you content , sister ? :
EMILIA Yes , I must , sir , :
Else both miscarry . :
THESEUS , [ to Palamon and Arcite ] :
Come , shake hands again , then , :
And take heed , as you are gentlemen , this quarrel :
Sleep till the hour prefixed , and hold your course . :
PALAMON :
We dare not fail thee , Theseus . :
[ They shake hands again . ] :
THESEUS Come , I 'll give you :
Now usage like to princes and to friends . :
When you return , who wins I 'll settle here ; :
Who loses , yet I 'll weep upon his bier . :
[ They exit . ] :

[ Enter Jailer and his Friend . ] :
JAILER :
Heard you no more ? Was nothing said of me :
Concerning the escape of Palamon ? :
Good sir , remember ! :
FIRST FRIEND Nothing that I heard , :
For I came home before the business :
Was fully ended . Yet I might perceive , :
Ere I departed , a great likelihood :
Of both their pardons ; for Hippolyta :
And fair-eyed Emily , upon their knees , :
Begged with such handsome pity that the Duke , :
Methought , stood staggering whether he should :
follow :
His rash oath or the sweet compassion :
Of those two ladies . And , to second them , :
That truly noble prince , Pirithous-- :
Half his own heart--set in too , that I hope :
