A sense to know a man unarmed and can :
Smell where resistance is . I 'll set it down :
He 's torn to pieces ; they howled many together , :
And then they fed on him ; so much for that . :
Be bold to ring the bell . How stand I then ? :
All 's chared when he is gone . No , no , I lie . :
My father 's to be hanged for his escape ; :
Myself to beg , if I prized life so much :
As to deny my act , but that I would not , :
Should I try death by dozens . I am moped ; :
Food took I none these two days ; :
Sipped some water . I have not closed mine eyes :
Save when my lids scoured off their brine . Alas , :
Dissolve , my life ! Let not my sense unsettle , :
Lest I should drown , or stab , or hang myself . :
O state of nature , fail together in me , :
Since thy best props are warped ! So , which way now ? :
The best way is the next way to a grave ; :
Each errant step beside is torment . Lo , :
The moon is down , the crickets chirp , the screech :
owl :
Calls in the dawn . All offices are done :
Save what I fail in . But the point is this-- :
An end , and that is all . :

Scene 3 :

[ Enter Arcite with meat , wine , and files . ] :
ARCITE :
I should be near the place.--Ho ! Cousin Palamon ! :
PALAMON , [ within ] :
Arcite ? :
ARCITE The same . I have brought you food and files . :
Come forth and fear not ; here 's no Theseus . :
[ Enter Palamon . ] :
PALAMON :
Nor none so honest , Arcite . :
ARCITE That 's no matter . :
We 'll argue that hereafter . Come , take courage ; :
You shall not die thus beastly . Here , sir , drink-- :
I know you are faint--then I 'll talk further with you . :
PALAMON :
Arcite , thou mightst now poison me . :
ARCITE I might ; :
But I must fear you first . Sit down and , good now , :
No more of these vain parleys . Let us not , :
Having our ancient reputation with us , :
Make talk for fools and cowards . To your health . :
[ He drinks . ] :
PALAMON Do ! :
ARCITE :
Pray sit down , then , and let me entreat you , :
By all the honesty and honor in you , :
No mention of this woman ; ' twill disturb us . :
We shall have time enough . :
PALAMON Well , sir , I 'll pledge you . :
[ He drinks . ] :
ARCITE :
Drink a good hearty draught ; it breeds good blood , :
man . :
Do not you feel it thaw you ? :
PALAMON Stay , I 'll tell you :
After a draught or two more . :
ARCITE Spare it not . :
The Duke has more , coz . Eat now . :
PALAMON Yes . [ He eats . ] :
ARCITE I am glad :
You have so good a stomach . :
PALAMON I am gladder :
I have so good meat to ' t . :
ARCITE Is ' t not mad lodging :
Here in the wild woods , cousin ? :
PALAMON Yes , for them :
That have wild consciences . :
ARCITE How tastes your :
victuals ? :
Your hunger needs no sauce , I see . :
PALAMON Not much . :
But if it did , yours is too tart , sweet cousin . :
What is this ? :
ARCITE Venison . :
PALAMON ' Tis a lusty meat . :
Give me more wine . Here , Arcite , to the wenches :
We have known in our days ! :
[ He raises his cup in a toast . ] :
The Lord Steward 's :
daughter ! :
Do you remember her ? :
ARCITE After you , coz . :
PALAMON :
