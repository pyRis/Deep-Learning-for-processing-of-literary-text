Without my leave and officers of arms ? :
By Castor , both shall die . :
PALAMON Hold thy word , Theseus . :
We are certainly both traitors , both despisers :
Of thee and of thy goodness . I am Palamon , :
That cannot love thee , he that broke thy prison . :
Think well what that deserves . And this is Arcite . :
A bolder traitor never trod thy ground , :
A falser ne 'er seemed friend . This is the man :
Was begged and banished ; this is he contemns thee :
And what thou dar 'st do ; and in this disguise , :
Against thine own edict , follows thy sister , :
That fortunate bright star , the fair Emilia , :
Whose servant--if there be a right in seeing :
And first bequeathing of the soul to--justly :
I am ; and , which is more , dares think her his . :
This treachery , like a most trusty lover , :
I called him now to answer . If thou be 'st :
As thou art spoken , great and virtuous , :
The true decider of all injuries , :
Say " Fight again , " and thou shalt see me , Theseus , :
Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy . :
Then take my life ; I 'll woo thee to ' t . :
PIRITHOUS O heaven , :
What more than man is this ! :
THESEUS I have sworn . :
ARCITE We seek not :
Thy breath of mercy , Theseus . ' Tis to me :
A thing as soon to die as thee to say it , :
And no more moved . Where this man calls me :
traitor , :
Let me say thus much : if in love be treason , :
In service of so excellent a beauty , :
As I love most , and in that faith will perish , :
As I have brought my life here to confirm it , :
As I have served her truest , worthiest , :
As I dare kill this cousin that denies it , :
So let me be most traitor , and you please me . :
For scorning thy edict , duke , ask that lady :
Why she is fair , and why her eyes command me :
Stay here to love her ; and if she say " traitor , " :
I am a villain fit to lie unburied . :
PALAMON :
Thou shalt have pity of us both , O Theseus , :
If unto neither thou show mercy . Stop , :
As thou art just , thy noble ear against us ; :
As thou art valiant , for thy cousin 's soul , :
Whose twelve strong labors crown his memory , :
Let 's die together at one instant , duke ; :
Only a little let him fall before me , :
That I may tell my soul he shall not have her . :
THESEUS :
I grant your wish , for to say true , your cousin :
Has ten times more offended , for I gave him :
More mercy than you found , sir , your offenses :
Being no more than his.--None here speak for ' em , :
For ere the sun set both shall sleep forever . :
HIPPOLYTA :
Alas , the pity ! Now or never , sister , :
Speak not to be denied . That face of yours :
Will bear the curses else of after ages :
For these lost cousins . :
EMILIA In my face , dear sister , :
I find no anger to ' em , nor no ruin . :
The misadventure of their own eyes kill ' em . :
Yet that I will be woman and have pity , :
My knees shall grow to th ' ground but I 'll get mercy . :
[ She kneels . ] :
Help me , dear sister ; in a deed so virtuous , :
The powers of all women will be with us . :
[ Hippolyta kneels . ] :
Most royal brother-- :
HIPPOLYTA Sir , by our tie of marriage-- :
EMILIA :
By your own spotless honor-- :
HIPPOLYTA By that faith , :
That fair hand , and that honest heart you gave me-- :
EMILIA :
By that you would have pity in another ; :
