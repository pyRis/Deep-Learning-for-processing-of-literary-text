Banished the kingdom ? ' Tis a benefit , :
A mercy I must thank ' em for ; but banished :
The free enjoying of that face I die for , :
O , ' twas a studied punishment , a death :
Beyond imagination--such a vengeance :
That , were I old and wicked , all my sins :
Could never pluck upon me . Palamon , :
Thou hast the start now ; thou shalt stay and see :
Her bright eyes break each morning ' gainst thy :
window :
And let in life into thee ; thou shalt feed :
Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty :
That nature ne 'er exceeded nor ne 'er shall . :
Good gods , what happiness has Palamon ! :
Twenty to one he 'll come to speak to her , :
And if she be as gentle as she 's fair , :
I know she 's his . He has a tongue will tame :
Tempests and make the wild rocks wanton . :
Come what can come , :
The worst is death . I will not leave the kingdom . :
I know mine own is but a heap of ruins , :
And no redress there . If I go , he has her . :
I am resolved another shape shall make me :
Or end my fortunes . Either way I am happy . :
I 'll see her and be near her , or no more . :
[ Enter four Country people , and one with :
a garland before them . ] :
[ Arcite steps aside . ] :
FIRST COUNTRYMAN My masters , I 'll be there , that 's :
certain . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN And I 'll be there . :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN And I. :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN Why , then , have with you , boys . :
'Tis but a chiding . Let the plough play today ; I 'll :
tickle ' t out of the jades ' tails tomorrow . :
FIRST COUNTRYMAN I am sure to have my wife as jealous :
as a turkey , but that 's all one . I 'll go through ; :
let her mumble . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN Clap her aboard tomorrow night :
and stow her , and all 's made up again . :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN Ay , do but put a fescue in her fist :
and you shall see her take a new lesson out and be :
a good wench . Do we all hold against the Maying ? :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN Hold ? What should ail us ? :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN Arcas will be there . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN And Sennois and Rycas ; and :
three better lads ne 'er danced under green tree . :
And you know what wenches , ha ! But will the :
dainty domine , the Schoolmaster , keep touch , do :
you think ? For he does all , you know . :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN He 'll eat a hornbook ere he fail . :
Go to , the matter 's too far driven between him and :
the tanner 's daughter to let slip now ; and she must :
see the Duke , and she must dance too . :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN Shall we be lusty ? :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN All the boys in Athens blow wind :
i ' th ' breech on ' s . And here I 'll be and there I 'll be , :
for our town , and here again , and there again . Ha , :
boys , hey for the weavers ! :
FIRST COUNTRYMAN This must be done i ' th ' woods . :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN O pardon me . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN By any means ; our thing of learning :
says so--where he himself will edify the Duke :
most parlously in our behalfs . He 's excellent i ' th ' :
woods ; bring him to th ' plains , his learning makes :
no cry . :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN We 'll see the sports , then every :
man to ' s tackle . And , sweet companions , let 's rehearse , :
by any means , before the ladies see us , and :
do sweetly , and God knows what may come on ' t . :
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN Content . The sports once ended , :
we 'll perform . Away , boys , and hold . :
