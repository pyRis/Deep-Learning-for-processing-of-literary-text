THESEUS Never Fortune :
Did play a subtler game . The conquered triumphs ; :
The victor has the loss ; yet in the passage :
The gods have been most equal.--Palamon , :
Your kinsman hath confessed the right o ' th ' lady :
Did lie in you , for you first saw her and :
Even then proclaimed your fancy . He restored her :
As your stol 'n jewel and desired your spirit :
To send him hence forgiven . The gods my justice :
Take from my hand and they themselves become :
The executioners . Lead your lady off , :
And call your lovers from the stage of death , :
Whom I adopt my friends . A day or two :
Let us look sadly , and give grace unto :
The funeral of Arcite , in whose end :
The visages of bridegrooms we 'll put on :
And smile with Palamon--for whom an hour , :
But one hour since , I was as dearly sorry :
As glad of Arcite , and am now as glad :
As for him sorry . O you heavenly charmers , :
What things you make of us ! For what we lack :
We laugh , for what we have are sorry , still :
Are children in some kind . Let us be thankful :
For that which is , and with you leave dispute :
That are above our question . Let 's go off :
And bear us like the time . :
[ Flourish . They exit . ] :
[ Enter Epilogue . ] :
EPILOGUE :
I would now ask you how you like the play , :
But , as it is with schoolboys , cannot say . :
I am cruel fearful ! Pray yet , stay a while , :
And let me look upon you . No man smile ? :
Then it goes hard , I see . He that has :
Loved a young handsome wench , then , show his :
face-- :
'Tis strange if none be here--and , if he will , :
Against his conscience let him hiss and kill :
Our market . ' Tis in vain , I see , to stay you . :
Have at the worst can come , then ! Now what say :
you ? :
And yet mistake me not : I am not bold . :
We have no such cause . If the tale we have told-- :
For ' tis no other--any way content you-- :
For to that honest purpose it was meant you-- :
We have our end ; and you shall have ere long , :
I dare say , many a better , to prolong :
Your old loves to us . We , and all our might , :
Rest at your service . Gentlemen , good night . :
