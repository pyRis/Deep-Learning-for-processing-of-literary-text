On the sinister side the heart lies ; Palamon :
Had the best-boding chance . :
[ Another cry , and shout within , and cornets . ] :
This burst of clamor :
Is sure th ' end o ' th ' combat . :
[ Enter Servant . ] :
SERVANT :
They said that Palamon had Arcite 's body :
Within an inch o ' th ' pyramid , that the cry :
Was general " A Palamon . " But anon , :
Th ' assistants made a brave redemption , and :
The two bold titlers at this instant are :
Hand to hand at it . :
EMILIA Were they metamorphosed :
Both into one--O , why , there were no woman :
Worth so composed a man ! Their single share , :
Their nobleness peculiar to them , gives :
The prejudice of disparity , value 's shortness , :
To any lady breathing . :
[ Cornets . Cry within , " Arcite , Arcite . " ] :
More exulting ? :
" Palamon " still ? :
SERVANT Nay , now the sound is " Arcite . " :
EMILIA :
I prithee lay attention to the cry ; :
Set both thine ears to th ' business . :
[ Cornets . A great shout , and cry " Arcite , victory ! " ] :
SERVANT The cry is " Arcite " :
And " Victory ! Hark , Arcite , victory ! " :
The combat 's consummation is proclaimed :
By the wind instruments . :
EMILIA Half-sights saw :
That Arcite was no babe . God 's lid , his richness :
And costliness of spirit looked through him ; it could :
No more be hid in him than fire in flax , :
Than humble banks can go to law with waters :
That drift-winds force to raging . I did think :
Good Palamon would miscarry , yet I knew not :
Why I did think so . Our reasons are not prophets :
When oft our fancies are . They are coming off . :
Alas , poor Palamon ! :
[ Cornets . Enter Theseus , Hippolyta , Pirithous , :
Arcite as victor , and Attendants and others . ] :
THESEUS :
Lo , where our sister is in expectation , :
Yet quaking and unsettled.--Fairest Emily , :
The gods by their divine arbitrament :
Have given you this knight ; he is a good one :
As ever struck at head.--Give me your hands . :
Receive you her , you him . Be plighted with :
A love that grows as you decay . :
ARCITE Emily , :
To buy you I have lost what 's dearest to me :
Save what is bought , and yet I purchase cheaply , :
As I do rate your value . :
THESEUS O loved sister , :
He speaks now of as brave a knight as e 'er :
Did spur a noble steed . Surely the gods :
Would have him die a bachelor , lest his race :
Should show i ' th ' world too godlike . His behavior :
So charmed me that methought Alcides was :
To him a sow of lead . If I could praise :
Each part of him to th ' all I have spoke , your Arcite :
Did not lose by ' t , for he that was thus good :
Encountered yet his better . I have heard :
Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o ' th ' night :
With their contentious throats , now one the higher , :
Anon the other , then again the first , :
And by-and-by out-breasted , that the sense :
Could not be judge between ' em . So it fared :
Good space between these kinsmen , till heavens did :
Make hardly one the winner.--Wear the garland :
With joy that you have won.--For the subdued , :
Give them our present justice , since I know :
Their lives but pinch ' em . Let it here be done . :
The scene 's not for our seeing . Go we hence :
Right joyful , with some sorrow.--Arm your prize ; :
I know you will not lose her.--Hippolyta , :
I see one eye of yours conceives a tear , :
The which it will deliver . :
EMILIA Is this winning ? :
