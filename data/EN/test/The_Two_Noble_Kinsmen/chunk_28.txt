PIRITHOUS Nay , then , I 'll in too . :
[ He kneels . ] :
By all our friendship , sir , by all our dangers ; :
By all you love most , wars and this sweet lady-- :
EMILIA :
By that you would have trembled to deny :
A blushing maid-- :
HIPPOLYTA By your own eyes ; by strength , :
In which you swore I went beyond all women , :
Almost all men , and yet I yielded , Theseus-- :
PIRITHOUS :
To crown all this : by your most noble soul , :
Which cannot want due mercy , I beg first-- :
HIPPOLYTA :
Next hear my prayers-- :
EMILIA Last let me entreat , sir-- :
PIRITHOUS :
For mercy . :
HIPPOLYTA Mercy . :
EMILIA Mercy on these princes . :
THESEUS :
You make my faith reel . [ ( To Emilia . ) ] Say I felt :
Compassion to ' em both , how would you place it ? :
[ They rise from their knees . ] :
EMILIA :
Upon their lives , but with their banishments . :
THESEUS :
You are a right woman , sister : you have pity , :
But want the understanding where to use it . :
If you desire their lives , invent a way :
Safer than banishment . Can these two live , :
And have the agony of love about ' em , :
And not kill one another ? Every day :
They 'd fight about you , hourly bring your honor :
In public question with their swords . Be wise , then , :
And here forget ' em ; it concerns your credit :
And my oath equally . I have said they die . :
Better they fall by th ' law than one another . :
Bow not my honor . :
EMILIA O , my noble brother , :
That oath was rashly made , and in your anger ; :
Your reason will not hold it . If such vows :
Stand for express will , all the world must perish . :
Besides , I have another oath ' gainst yours , :
Of more authority , I am sure more love , :
Not made in passion neither , but good heed . :
THESEUS :
What is it , sister ? :
PIRITHOUS Urge it home , brave lady . :
EMILIA :
That you would ne 'er deny me anything :
Fit for my modest suit and your free granting . :
I tie you to your word now ; if you fail in ' t , :
Think how you maim your honor-- :
For now I am set a-begging , sir , I am deaf :
To all but your compassion--how their lives :
Might breed the ruin of my name . Opinion ! :
Shall anything that loves me perish for me ? :
That were a cruel wisdom . Do men prune :
The straight young boughs that blush with thousand :
blossoms :
Because they may be rotten ? O , Duke Theseus , :
The goodly mothers that have groaned for these , :
And all the longing maids that ever loved , :
If your vow stand , shall curse me and my beauty , :
And in their funeral songs for these two cousins :
Despise my cruelty , and cry woe worth me , :
Till I am nothing but the scorn of women . :
For heaven 's sake , save their lives , and banish ' em . :
THESEUS :
On what conditions ? :
EMILIA Swear ' em never more :
To make me their contention , or to know me , :
To tread upon thy dukedom , and to be , :
Wherever they shall travel , ever strangers :
To one another . :
PALAMON I 'll be cut a-pieces :
Before I take this oath ! Forget I love her ? :
O , all you gods , despise me then ! Thy banishment :
I not mislike , so we may fairly carry :
Our swords and cause along ; else never trifle , :
But take our lives , duke . I must love , and will , :
And for that love must and dare kill this cousin :
On any piece the Earth has . :
THESEUS Will you , Arcite , :
