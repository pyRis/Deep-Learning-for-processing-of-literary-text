Of all this sprightly sharpness not a smile . :
Yet these that we count errors may become him ; :
Narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly . :
O , who can find the bent of woman 's fancy ? :
I am a fool ; my reason is lost in me ; :
I have no choice , and I have lied so lewdly :
That women ought to beat me . On my knees :
I ask thy pardon : Palamon , thou art alone :
And only beautiful , and these the eyes , :
These the bright lamps of beauty , that command :
And threaten love , and what young maid dare cross :
'em ? :
What a bold gravity , and yet inviting , :
Has this brown manly face ! O Love , this only :
From this hour is complexion . Lie there , Arcite . :
[ She puts aside his picture . ] :
Thou art a changeling to him , a mere gypsy , :
And this the noble body . I am sotted , :
Utterly lost . My virgin 's faith has fled me . :
For if my brother but even now had asked me :
Whether I loved , I had run mad for Arcite . :
Now , if my sister , more for Palamon . :
Stand both together . Now , come ask me , brother . :
Alas , I know not ! Ask me now , sweet sister . :
I may go look ! What a mere child is Fancy , :
That , having two fair gauds of equal sweetness , :
Cannot distinguish , but must cry for both . :
[ Enter a Gentleman . ] :
How now , sir ? :
GENTLEMAN From the noble duke , your brother , :
Madam , I bring you news : the knights are come . :
EMILIA :
To end the quarrel ? :
GENTLEMAN Yes . :
EMILIA Would I might end first ! :
What sins have I committed , chaste Diana , :
That my unspotted youth must now be soiled :
With blood of princes , and my chastity :
Be made the altar where the lives of lovers-- :
Two greater and two better never yet :
Made mothers joy--must be the sacrifice :
To my unhappy beauty ? :
[ Enter Theseus , Hippolyta , Pirithous and Attendants . ] :
THESEUS , [ to Attendant ] Bring ' em in :
Quickly , by any means ; I long to see ' em . :
[ To Emilia . ] Your two contending lovers are :
returned , :
And with them their fair knights . Now , my fair :
sister , :
You must love one of them . :
EMILIA I had rather both , :
So neither for my sake should fall untimely . :
THESEUS :
Who saw ' em ? :
PIRITHOUS I awhile . :
GENTLEMAN And I. :
[ Enter a Messenger . ] :
THESEUS :
From whence come you , sir ? :
MESSENGER From the knights . :
THESEUS Pray :
speak , :
You that have seen them , what they are . :
MESSENGER I will , sir , :
And truly what I think . Six braver spirits :
Than these they have brought , if we judge by the :
outside , :
I never saw nor read of . He that stands :
In the first place with Arcite , by his seeming , :
Should be a stout man , by his face a prince-- :
His very looks so say him ; his complexion :
Nearer a brown than black--stern and yet noble-- :
Which shows him hardy , fearless , proud of dangers ; :
The circles of his eyes show fire within him , :
And as a heated lion , so he looks . :
His hair hangs long behind him , black and shining :
Like ravens ' wings ; his shoulders broad and strong , :
Armed long and round ; and on his thigh a sword :
Hung by a curious baldric , when he frowns :
To seal his will with . Better , o ' my conscience , :
Was never soldier 's friend . :
THESEUS :
Thou hast well described him . :
PIRITHOUS Yet a great :
deal short , :
Methinks , of him that 's first with Palamon . :
