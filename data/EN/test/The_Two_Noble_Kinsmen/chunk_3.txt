Of bread and sloth . :
THESEUS Artesius , that best knowest :
How to draw out , fit to this enterprise , :
The prim 'st for this proceeding , and the number :
To carry such a business : forth and levy :
Our worthiest instruments , whilst we dispatch :
This grand act of our life , this daring deed :
Of fate in wedlock . :
FIRST QUEEN , [ to Second and Third Queens ] :
Dowagers , take hands . :
Let us be widows to our woes . Delay :
Commends us to a famishing hope . :
ALL THE QUEENS Farewell . :
SECOND QUEEN :
We come unseasonably ; but when could grief :
Cull forth , as unpanged judgment can , fitt 'st time :
For best solicitation ? :
THESEUS Why , good ladies , :
This is a service whereto I am going :
Greater than any was ; it more imports me :
Than all the actions that I have foregone , :
Or futurely can cope . :
FIRST QUEEN The more proclaiming :
Our suit shall be neglected when her arms , :
Able to lock Jove from a synod , shall :
By warranting moonlight corselet thee . O , when :
Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall :
Upon thy tasteful lips , what wilt thou think :
Of rotten kings or blubbered queens ? What care :
For what thou feel 'st not , what thou feel 'st being :
able :
To make Mars spurn his drum ? O , if thou couch :
But one night with her , every hour in ' t will :
Take hostage of thee for a hundred , and :
Thou shalt remember nothing more than what :
That banquet bids thee to . :
HIPPOLYTA , [ to Theseus ] Though much unlike :
You should be so transported , as much sorry :
I should be such a suitor , yet I think :
Did I not , by th ' abstaining of my joy-- :
Which breeds a deeper longing--cure their surfeit :
That craves a present med 'cine , I should pluck :
All ladies ' scandal on me . [ She kneels . ] :
Therefore , sir , :
As I shall here make trial of my prayers , :
Either presuming them to have some force , :
Or sentencing for aye their vigor dumb , :
Prorogue this business we are going about , and :
hang :
Your shield afore your heart--about that neck :
Which is my fee , and which I freely lend :
To do these poor queens service . :
ALL QUEENS , [ to Emilia ] O , help now ! :
Our cause cries for your knee . :
EMILIA , [ to Theseus , kneeling ] If you grant not :
My sister her petition in that force , :
With that celerity and nature which :
She makes it in , from henceforth I 'll not dare :
To ask you anything , nor be so hardy :
Ever to take a husband . :
THESEUS Pray stand up . :
[ Hippolyta and Emilia rise . ] :
I am entreating of myself to do :
That which you kneel to have me.--Pirithous , :
Lead on the bride ; get you and pray the gods :
For success and return ; omit not anything :
In the pretended celebration.--Queens , :
Follow your soldier . [ To Artesius . ] As before , hence :
you , :
And at the banks of Aulis meet us with :
The forces you can raise , where we shall find :
The moiety of a number for a business :
More bigger looked . [ Artesius exits . ] :
[ To Hippolyta . ] Since that our theme is haste , :
I stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip ; :
Sweet , keep it as my token.--Set you forward , :
For I will see you gone . :
[ The wedding procession begins to exit :
towards the temple . ] :
Farewell , my beauteous sister.--Pirithous , :
Keep the feast full ; bate not an hour on ' t . :
PIRITHOUS Sir , :
I 'll follow you at heels . The feast 's solemnity :
Shall want till your return . :
THESEUS Cousin , I charge you , :
Budge not from Athens . We shall be returning :
