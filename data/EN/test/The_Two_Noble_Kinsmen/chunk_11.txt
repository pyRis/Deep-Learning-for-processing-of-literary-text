ARCITE Till our deaths it cannot . :
[ Enter Emilia and her Woman , below . ] :
And after death our spirits shall be led :
To those that love eternally . [ Palamon catches sight :
of Emilia . ] :
Speak on , sir . :
EMILIA , [ to her Woman ] :
This garden has a world of pleasures in ' t . :
What flower is this ? :
WOMAN ' Tis called narcissus , madam . :
EMILIA :
That was a fair boy certain , but a fool :
To love himself . Were there not maids enough ? :
ARCITE , [ to Palamon , who is stunned by the sight of Emilia ] :
Pray , forward . :
PALAMON Yes . :
EMILIA , [ to Woman ] Or were they all hard-hearted ? :
WOMAN :
They could not be to one so fair . :
EMILIA Thou wouldst not . :
WOMAN :
I think I should not , madam . :
EMILIA That 's a good wench . :
But take heed to your kindness , though . :
WOMAN Why , :
madam ? :
EMILIA :
Men are mad things . :
ARCITE , [ to Palamon ] Will you go forward , :
cousin ? :
EMILIA , [ to Woman ] :
Canst not thou work such flowers in silk , wench ? :
WOMAN Yes . :
EMILIA :
I 'll have a gown full of ' em , and of these . :
This is pretty color . Will ' t not do :
Rarely upon a skirt , wench ? :
WOMAN Dainty , madam . :
ARCITE , [ to Palamon ] :
Cousin , cousin ! How do you , sir ? Why , Palamon ! :
PALAMON :
Never till now I was in prison , Arcite . :
ARCITE :
Why , what 's the matter , man ? :
PALAMON Behold , and wonder ! :
By heaven , she is a goddess . :
ARCITE , [ seeing Emilia ] Ha ! :
PALAMON Do reverence . :
She is a goddess , Arcite . :
EMILIA , [ to Woman ] Of all flowers :
Methinks a rose is best . :
WOMAN Why , gentle madam ? :
EMILIA :
It is the very emblem of a maid . :
For when the west wind courts her gently , :
How modestly she blows and paints the sun :
With her chaste blushes ! When the north comes :
near her , :
Rude and impatient , then , like chastity , :
She locks her beauties in her bud again , :
And leaves him to base briers . :
WOMAN Yet , good madam , :
Sometimes her modesty will blow so far :
She falls for ' t . A maid , :
If she have any honor , would be loath :
To take example by her . :
EMILIA Thou art wanton ! :
ARCITE , [ to Palamon ] :
She is wondrous fair . :
PALAMON She is all the beauty extant . :
EMILIA , [ to Woman ] :
The sun grows high . Let 's walk in . Keep these :
flowers . :
We 'll see how near art can come near their colors . :
I am wondrous merry-hearted . I could laugh now . :
WOMAN :
I could lie down , I am sure . :
EMILIA And take one with you ? :
WOMAN :
That 's as we bargain , madam . :
EMILIA Well , agree then . :
[ Emilia and Woman exit . ] :
PALAMON :
What think you of this beauty ? :
ARCITE ' Tis a rare one . :
PALAMON :
Is ' t but a rare one ? :
ARCITE Yes , a matchless beauty . :
PALAMON :
Might not a man well lose himself and love her ? :
ARCITE :
I cannot tell what you have done ; I have , :
Beshrew mine eyes for ' t ! Now I feel my shackles . :
PALAMON :
You love her , then ? :
ARCITE Who would not ? :
PALAMON And desire her ? :
ARCITE :
Before my liberty . :
PALAMON I saw her first . :
ARCITE :
That 's nothing . :
PALAMON But it shall be . :
