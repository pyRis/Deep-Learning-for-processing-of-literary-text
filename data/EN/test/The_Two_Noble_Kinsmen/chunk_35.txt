Loses a noble cousin for thy sins . :

Scene 3 :
= = = = = = = :
[ Enter Jailer , Wooer , Doctor . ] :
DOCTOR Her distraction is more at some time of the :
moon than at other some , is it not ? :
JAILER She is continually in a harmless distemper , :
sleeps little , altogether without appetite , save often :
drinking , dreaming of another world , and a better ; :
and what broken piece of matter soe 'er she 's about , :
the name Palamon lards it , that she farces ev 'ry :
business withal , fits it to every question . :
[ Enter Jailer 's Daughter . ] :
Look where she comes ; you shall perceive her :
behavior . [ They stand aside . ] :
DAUGHTER I have forgot it quite . The burden on ' t was :
" down-a down-a , " and penned by no worse man :
than Geraldo , Emilia 's schoolmaster . He 's as fantastical , :
too , as ever he may go upon ' s legs , for in :
the next world will Dido see Palamon , and then :
will she be out of love with Aeneas . :
DOCTOR , [ aside to Jailer and Wooer ] What stuff 's here ? :
Poor soul . :
JAILER E 'en thus all day long . :
DAUGHTER Now for this charm that I told you of , you :
must bring a piece of silver on the tip of your :
tongue , or no ferry ; then if it be your chance to :
come where the blessed spirits are , there 's a :
sight now ! We maids that have our livers perished , :
cracked to pieces with love , we shall come there , :
and do nothing all day long but pick flowers with :
Proserpine . Then will I make Palamon a nosegay ; :
then let him mark me then . :
DOCTOR How prettily she 's amiss ! Note her a little :
further . :
DAUGHTER Faith , I 'll tell you , sometime we go to :
barley-break , we of the blessed . Alas , ' tis a sore life :
they have i ' th ' other place--such burning , frying , :
boiling , hissing , howling , chatt 'ring , cursing--O , :
they have shrewd measure , take heed ! If one be :
mad , or hang or drown themselves , thither they :
go , Jupiter bless us , and there shall we be put in :
a cauldron of lead and usurers ' grease , amongst a :
whole million of cutpurses , and there boil like a :
gammon of bacon that will never be enough . :
DOCTOR How her brains coins ! :
DAUGHTER Lords and courtiers that have got maids :
with child , they are in this place . They shall stand :
in fire up to the navel and in ice up to th ' heart , and :
there th ' offending part burns and the deceiving :
part freezes : in troth , a very grievous punishment , :
as one would think , for such a trifle . Believe me , :
one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on ' t , I 'll :
assure you . :
DOCTOR How she continues this fancy ! ' Tis not an engraffed :
madness , but a most thick and profound :
melancholy . :
DAUGHTER To hear there a proud lady and a proud city :
wife howl together--I were a beast an I 'd call it :
good sport . One cries " O this smoke ! " th ' other , :
" This fire ! " ; one cries , " O , that ever I did it behind :
the arras ! " and then howls ; th ' other curses a suing :
fellow and her garden house . :
[ Sings . ] :
I will be true , my stars , my fate , etc . :
[ Daughter exits . ] :
JAILER What think you of her , sir ? :
DOCTOR I think she has a perturbed mind , which I :
cannot minister to . :
JAILER Alas , what then ? :
