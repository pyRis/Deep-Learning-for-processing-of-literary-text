I marvel how they would have looked had they :
been victors , that with such a constant nobility enforce :
a freedom out of bondage , making misery :
their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at . :
JAILER Do they so ? :
DAUGHTER It seems to me they have no more sense :
of their captivity than I of ruling Athens . They eat :
well , look merrily , discourse of many things , but :
nothing of their own restraint and disasters . Yet :
sometimes a divided sigh , martyred as ' twere i ' th ' :
deliverance , will break from one of them--when :
the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that :
I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid , or at least :
a sigher to be comforted . :
WOOER I never saw ' em . :
JAILER The Duke himself came privately in the night , :
and so did they . :
[ Enter Palamon and Arcite , in shackles , above . ] :
What the reason of it is , I know not . Look , yonder :
they are ; that 's Arcite looks out . :
DAUGHTER No , sir , no , that 's Palamon . Arcite is the :
lower of the twain ; you may perceive a part of :
him . :
JAILER Go to , leave your pointing ; they would not :
make us their object . Out of their sight . :
DAUGHTER It is a holiday to look on them . Lord , the :
diff 'rence of men ! :
[ Jailer , Daughter , and Wooer exit . ] :

[ Palamon and Arcite remain , above . ] :
PALAMON :
How do you , noble cousin ? :
ARCITE How do you , sir ? :
PALAMON :
Why , strong enough to laugh at misery :
And bear the chance of war ; yet we are prisoners :
I fear forever , cousin . :
ARCITE I believe it , :
And to that destiny have patiently :
Laid up my hour to come . :
PALAMON O , cousin Arcite , :
Where is Thebes now ? Where is our noble country ? :
Where are our friends and kindreds ? Never more :
Must we behold those comforts , never see :
The hardy youths strive for the games of honor , :
Hung with the painted favors of their ladies , :
Like tall ships under sail ; then start amongst ' em :
And as an east wind leave ' em all behind us , :
Like lazy clouds , whilst Palamon and Arcite , :
Even in the wagging of a wanton leg , :
Outstripped the people 's praises , won the garlands :
Ere they have time to wish ' em ours . O , never :
Shall we two exercise , like twins of honor , :
Our arms again , and feel our fiery horses :
Like proud seas under us . Our good swords now-- :
Better the red-eyed god of war ne 'er wore-- :
Ravished our sides , like age must run to rust :
And deck the temples of those gods that hate us ; :
These hands shall never draw ' em out like lightning :
To blast whole armies more . :
ARCITE No , Palamon , :
Those hopes are prisoners with us . Here we are :
And here the graces of our youths must wither :
Like a too-timely spring . Here age must find us :
And--which is heaviest , Palamon--unmarried . :
The sweet embraces of a loving wife , :
Loaden with kisses , armed with thousand Cupids , :
Shall never clasp our necks ; no issue know us-- :
No figures of ourselves shall we e 'er see , :
To glad our age , and like young eagles teach ' em :
Boldly to gaze against bright arms and say :
" Remember what your fathers were , and conquer ! " :
The fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishments :
And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune :
Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done :
To youth and nature . This is all our world . :
We shall know nothing here but one another , :
Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes . :
