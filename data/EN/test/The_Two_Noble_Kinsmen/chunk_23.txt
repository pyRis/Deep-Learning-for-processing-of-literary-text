Till I come to the sound-a . " :
There was three fools , fell out about an owlet-- :
[ Sings ] The one he said it was an owl , :
The other he said nay , :
The third he said it was a hawk , :
And her bells were cut away . :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN There 's a dainty madwoman , master , :
comes i ' th ' nick , as mad as a March hare . If we :
can get her dance , we are made again . I warrant :
her , she 'll do the rarest gambols . :
FIRST COUNTRYMAN A madwoman ? We are made , boys . :
SCHOOLMASTER , [ to Jailer 's Daughter ] And are you mad , :
good woman ? :
DAUGHTER I would be sorry else . Give me your hand . :
SCHOOLMASTER Why ? :
DAUGHTER I can tell your fortune . [ She looks at his :
hand . ] You are a fool . Tell ten.--I have posed him . :
Buzz ! --Friend , you must eat no white bread ; if :
you do , your teeth will bleed extremely . Shall we :
dance , ho ? I know you , you 're a tinker . Sirrah tinker , :
stop no more holes but what you should . :
SCHOOLMASTER Dii boni ! A tinker , damsel ? :
DAUGHTER Or a conjurer . Raise me a devil now , and let :
him play Chi passa o ' th ' bells and bones . :
SCHOOLMASTER Go , take her , and fluently persuade her :
to a peace . Et opus exegi , quod nec Iovis ira , nec :
ignis . Strike up , and lead her in . :
SECOND COUNTRYMAN Come , lass , let 's trip it . :
DAUGHTER I 'll lead . :
THIRD COUNTRYMAN Do , do ! :
SCHOOLMASTER Persuasively , and cunningly . :
[ Wind horns . ] :
Away , boys ! I hear the horns . Give me some :
meditation , and mark your cue . :
[ All but Schoolmaster exit . ] :
Pallas , inspire me ! :
[ Enter Theseus , Pirithous , Hippolyta , Emilia , and train . ] :
THESEUS This way the stag took . :
SCHOOLMASTER Stay , and edify ! :
THESEUS What have we here ? :
PIRITHOUS Some country sport , upon my life , sir . :
THESEUS , [ to Schoolmaster ] Well , sir , go forward . We :
will " edify . " [ Chairs and stools brought out . ] :
Ladies , sit down . We 'll stay it . :
[ Theseus , Hippolyta , and Emilia sit . ] :
SCHOOLMASTER :
Thou doughty duke , all hail ! --All hail , sweet ladies ! :
THESEUS , [ aside ] This is a cold beginning . :
SCHOOLMASTER :
If you but favor , our country pastime made is . :
We are a few of those collected here :
That ruder tongues distinguish " villager . " :
And to say verity , and not to fable , :
We are a merry rout , or else a rabble , :
Or company , or by a figure , chorus , :
That ' fore thy dignity will dance a morris . :
And I that am the rectifier of all , :
By title pedagogus , that let fall :
The birch upon the breeches of the small ones , :
And humble with a ferula the tall ones , :
Do here present this machine , or this frame . :
And , dainty duke , whose doughty dismal fame :
From Dis to Daedalus , from post to pillar , :
Is blown abroad , help me , thy poor well-willer , :
And with thy twinkling eyes look right and straight :
Upon this mighty " Morr , " of mickle weight-- :
" Is " now comes in , which being glued together :
Makes " Morris , " and the cause that we came hither . :
The body of our sport , of no small study , :
I first appear , though rude , and raw , and muddy , :
To speak before thy noble grace this tenner , :
At whose great feet I offer up my penner . :
