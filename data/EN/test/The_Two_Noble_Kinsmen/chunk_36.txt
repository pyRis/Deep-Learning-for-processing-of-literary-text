JAILER What think you of her , sir ? :
DOCTOR I think she has a perturbed mind , which I :
cannot minister to . :
JAILER Alas , what then ? :
DOCTOR Understand you she ever affected any man :
ere she beheld Palamon ? :
JAILER I was once , sir , in great hope she had fixed her :
liking on this gentleman , my friend . :
WOOER I did think so , too , and would account I had a :
great penn 'orth on ' t to give half my state that both :
she and I , at this present , stood unfeignedly on the :
same terms . :
DOCTOR That intemp 'rate surfeit of her eye hath distempered :
the other senses . They may return and :
settle again to execute their preordained faculties , :
but they are now in a most extravagant vagary . :
This you must do : confine her to a place where :
the light may rather seem to steal in than be :
permitted.--Take upon you , young sir , her friend , :
the name of Palamon ; say you come to eat with :
her , and to commune of love . This will catch her :
attention , for this her mind beats upon ; other :
objects that are inserted ' tween her mind and eye :
become the pranks and friskins of her madness . :
Sing to her such green songs of love as she says :
Palamon hath sung in prison . Come to her stuck :
in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of , :
and thereto make an addition of some other compounded :
odors which are grateful to the sense . :
All this shall become Palamon , for Palamon can :
sing , and Palamon is sweet and ev 'ry good thing . :
Desire to eat with her , carve her , drink to her , and :
still among intermingle your petition of grace and :
acceptance into her favor . Learn what maids have :
been her companions and playferes , and let them :
repair to her with Palamon in their mouths , and :
appear with tokens , as if they suggested for him.-- :
It is a falsehood she is in , which is with falsehoods :
to be combated . This may bring her to eat , :
to sleep , and reduce what 's now out of square in :
her into their former law and regiment . I have seen :
it approved , how many times I know not , but to :
make the number more , I have great hope in this . :
I will between the passages of this project come :
in with my appliance . Let us put it in execution :
and hasten the success , which doubt not will bring :
forth comfort . :

[ Flourish . Enter Theseus , Pirithous , Hippolyta , :
and Attendants . Three altars set up onstage . ] :
THESEUS :
Now let ' em enter and before the gods :
Tender their holy prayers . Let the temples :
Burn bright with sacred fires , and the altars :
In hallowed clouds commend their swelling incense :
To those above us . Let no due be wanting . :
They have a noble work in hand will honor :
The very powers that love ' em . :
PIRITHOUS Sir , they enter . :
[ Flourish of cornets . Enter Palamon and Arcite :
and their Knights . ] :
THESEUS :
You valiant and strong-hearted enemies , :
You royal german foes , that this day come :
To blow that nearness out that flames between you , :
Lay by your anger for an hour and , dove-like , :
Before the holy altars of your helpers , :
The all-feared gods , bow down your stubborn :
bodies . :
Your ire is more than mortal ; so your help be . :
And as the gods regard you , fight with justice . :
I 'll leave you to your prayers , and betwixt you :
I part my wishes . :
PIRITHOUS Honor crown the worthiest ! :
[ Theseus and his train exit . ] :
PALAMON :
