And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair :
ones , :
Hear and respect me . :
THIRD QUEEN , [ to Emilia ] :
Now for the love of him whom Jove hath marked :
The honor of your bed , and for the sake :
Of clear virginity , be advocate :
For us and our distresses . This good deed :
Shall raze you out o ' th ' book of trespasses :
All you are set down there . :
THESEUS , [ to First Queen ] :
Sad lady , rise . :
HIPPOLYTA , [ to Second Queen ] Stand up . :
EMILIA , [ to Third Queen ] No knees to me . :
What woman I may stead that is distressed :
Does bind me to her . :
THESEUS , [ to First Queen ] :
What 's your request ? Deliver you for all . :
FIRST QUEEN :
We are three queens whose sovereigns fell before :
The wrath of cruel Creon ; who endured :
The beaks of ravens , talons of the kites , :
And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes . :
He will not suffer us to burn their bones , :
To urn their ashes , nor to take th ' offense :
Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye :
Of holy Phoebus , but infects the winds :
With stench of our slain lords . O , pity , duke ! :
Thou purger of the Earth , draw thy feared sword :
That does good turns to th ' world ; give us the bones :
Of our dead kings , that we may chapel them ; :
And of thy boundless goodness take some note :
That for our crowned heads we have no roof :
Save this , which is the lion 's and the bear 's , :
And vault to everything . :
THESEUS Pray you , kneel not . :
I was transported with your speech and suffered :
Your knees to wrong themselves . I have heard the :
fortunes :
Of your dead lords , which gives me such lamenting :
As wakes my vengeance and revenge for ' em . :
King Capaneus was your lord . The day :
That he should marry you , at such a season :
As now it is with me , I met your groom :
By Mars 's altar . You were that time fair-- :
Not Juno 's mantle fairer than your tresses , :
Nor in more bounty spread her . Your wheaten :
wreath :
Was then nor threshed nor blasted . Fortune at you :
Dimpled her cheek with smiles . Hercules , our :
kinsman , :
Then weaker than your eyes , laid by his club ; :
He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide :
And swore his sinews thawed . O grief and time , :
Fearful consumers , you will all devour ! :
FIRST QUEEN O , I hope some god , :
Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood , :
Whereto he 'll infuse power , and press you forth :
Our undertaker . :
THESEUS O , no knees , none , widow ! :
Unto the helmeted Bellona use them :
And pray for me , your soldier . [ The First Queen rises . ] :
Troubled I am . [ Turns away . ] :
SECOND QUEEN Honored Hippolyta , :
Most dreaded Amazonian , that hast slain :
The scythe-tusked boar ; that with thy arm , as strong :
As it is white , wast near to make the male :
To thy sex captive , but that this thy lord , :
Born to uphold creation in that honor :
First nature styled it in , shrunk thee into :
The bound thou wast o 'erflowing , at once subduing :
Thy force and thy affection ; soldieress :
That equally canst poise sternness with pity , :
Whom now I know hast much more power on him :
Than ever he had on thee , who ow 'st his strength :
And his love too , who is a servant for :
The tenor of thy speech , dear glass of ladies , :
Bid him that we , whom flaming war doth scorch , :
Under the shadow of his sword may cool us ; :
Require him he advance it o 'er our heads ; :
