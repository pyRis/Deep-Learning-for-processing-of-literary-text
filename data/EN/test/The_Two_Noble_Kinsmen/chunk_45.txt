PALAMON , [ rising ] What :
Hath waked us from our dream ? :
PIRITHOUS List then : your :
cousin , :
Mounted upon a steed that Emily :
Did first bestow on him--a black one , owing :
Not a hair worth of white , which some will say :
Weakens his price , and many will not buy :
His goodness with this note , which superstition :
Here finds allowance--on this horse is Arcite :
Trotting the stones of Athens--which the calkins :
Did rather tell than trample , for the horse :
Would make his length a mile , if ' t pleased his rider :
To put pride in him . As he thus went counting :
The flinty pavement , dancing , as ' twere , to th ' music :
His own hooves made--for , as they say , from iron :
Came music 's origin--what envious flint , :
Cold as old Saturn , and like him possessed :
With fire malevolent , darted a spark , :
Or what fierce sulphur else , to this end made , :
I comment not ; the hot horse , hot as fire , :
Took toy at this and fell to what disorder :
His power could give his will ; bounds , comes on end , :
Forgets school-doing , being therein trained :
And of kind manage . Pig-like he whines :
At the sharp rowel , which he frets at rather :
Than any jot obeys ; seeks all foul means :
Of boist 'rous and rough jadery to disseat :
His lord that kept it bravely . When naught served , :
When neither curb would crack , girth break , nor :
diff 'ring plunges :
Disroot his rider whence he grew , but that :
He kept him ' tween his legs , on his hind hoofs :
On end he stands :
That Arcite 's legs , being higher than his head , :
Seemed with strange art to hang . His victor 's wreath :
Even then fell off his head , and presently :
Backward the jade comes o 'er , and his full poise :
Becomes the rider 's load . Yet is he living , :
But such a vessel ' tis that floats but for :
The surge that next approaches . He much desires :
To have some speech with you . Lo , he appears . :
[ Enter Theseus , Hippolyta , Emilia , :
and Arcite carried in a chair . ] :
PALAMON :
O , miserable end of our alliance ! :
The gods are mighty , Arcite . If thy heart , :
Thy worthy , manly heart , be yet unbroken , :
Give me thy last words . I am Palamon , :
One that yet loves thee dying . :
ARCITE Take Emilia :
And with her all the world 's joy . Reach thy hand ; :
Farewell . I have told my last hour . I was false , :
Yet never treacherous . Forgive me , cousin . :
One kiss from fair Emilia . [ She kisses him . ] :
'Tis done . :
Take her . I die . [ He dies . ] :
PALAMON Thy brave soul seek Elysium ! :
EMILIA :
I 'll close thine eyes , prince . Blessed souls be with :
thee ! :
Thou art a right good man , and while I live , :
This day I give to tears . :
PALAMON And I to honor . :
THESEUS :
In this place first you fought ; e 'en very here :
I sundered you . Acknowledge to the gods :
Our thanks that you are living . :
His part is played , and though it were too short , :
He did it well . Your day is lengthened , and :
The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you . :
The powerful Venus well hath graced her altar , :
And given you your love . Our master , Mars , :
Hath vouched his oracle , and to Arcite gave :
The grace of the contention . So the deities :
Have showed due justice.--Bear this hence . :
PALAMON O cousin , :
That we should things desire which do cost us :
The loss of our desire , that naught could buy :
Dear love but loss of dear love . :
