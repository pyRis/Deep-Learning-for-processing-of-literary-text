PALAMON Yes , but you must not love her . :
ARCITE :
I will not , as you do , to worship her :
As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess . :
I love her as a woman , to enjoy her . :
So both may love . :
PALAMON You shall not love at all . :
ARCITE Not love at all ! Who shall deny me ? :
PALAMON :
I , that first saw her ; I that took possession :
First with mine eye of all those beauties :
In her revealed to mankind . If thou lov 'st her , :
Or entertain 'st a hope to blast my wishes , :
Thou art a traitor , Arcite , and a fellow :
False as thy title to her . Friendship , blood , :
And all the ties between us I disclaim :
If thou once think upon her . :
ARCITE Yes , I love her , :
And , if the lives of all my name lay on it , :
I must do so . I love her with my soul . :
If that will lose you , farewell , Palamon . :
I say again , I love , and in loving her maintain :
I am as worthy and as free a lover :
And have as just a title to her beauty :
As any Palamon or any living :
That is a man 's son . :
PALAMON Have I called thee friend ? :
ARCITE :
Yes , and have found me so . Why are you moved :
thus ? :
Let me deal coldly with you : am not I :
Part of your blood , part of your soul ? You have :
told me :
That I was Palamon and you were Arcite . :
PALAMON :
Yes . :
ARCITE Am not I liable to those affections , :
Those joys , griefs , angers , fears , my friend shall :
suffer ? :
PALAMON :
You may be . :
ARCITE Why then would you deal so cunningly , :
So strangely , so unlike a noble kinsman , :
To love alone ? Speak truly , do you think me :
Unworthy of her sight ? :
PALAMON No , but unjust :
If thou pursue that sight . :
ARCITE Because another :
First sees the enemy , shall I stand still :
And let mine honor down , and never charge ? :
PALAMON :
Yes , if he be but one . :
ARCITE But say that one :
Had rather combat me ? :
PALAMON Let that one say so , :
And use thy freedom . Else , if thou pursuest her , :
Be as that cursed man that hates his country , :
A branded villain . :
ARCITE You are mad . :
PALAMON I must be . :
Till thou art worthy , Arcite , it concerns me . :
And in this madness if I hazard thee :
And take thy life , I deal but truly . :
ARCITE Fie , sir ! :
You play the child extremely . I will love her ; :
I must , I ought to do so , and I dare , :
And all this justly . :
PALAMON O , that now , that now , :
Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune :
To be one hour at liberty , and grasp :
Our good swords in our hands , I would quickly :
teach thee :
What ' twere to filch affection from another . :
Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse . :
Put but thy head out of this window more :
And , as I have a soul , I 'll nail thy life to ' t . :
ARCITE :
Thou dar 'st not , fool ; thou canst not ; thou art feeble . :
Put my head out ? I 'll throw my body out :
And leap the garden when I see her next , :
And pitch between her arms to anger thee . :
[ Enter Jailer , above . ] :
PALAMON :
No more ; the keeper 's coming . I shall live :
To knock thy brains out with my shackles . :
ARCITE Do ! :
JAILER :
By your leave , gentlemen . :
