The vine shall grow , but we shall never see it ; :
Summer shall come , and with her all delights , :
But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still . :
PALAMON :
'Tis too true , Arcite . To our Theban hounds :
That shook the aged forest with their echoes :
No more now must we halloo ; no more shake :
Our pointed javelins whilst the angry swine :
Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages , :
Struck with our well-steeled darts . All valiant uses , :
The food and nourishment of noble minds , :
In us two here shall perish ; we shall die , :
Which is the curse of honor , lastly , :
Children of grief and ignorance . :
ARCITE Yet , cousin , :
Even from the bottom of these miseries , :
From all that fortune can inflict upon us , :
I see two comforts rising , two mere blessings , :
If the gods please : to hold here a brave patience , :
And the enjoying of our griefs together . :
Whilst Palamon is with me , let me perish :
If I think this our prison ! :
PALAMON Certainly :
'Tis a main goodness , cousin , that our fortunes :
Were twined together . ' Tis most true , two souls :
Put in two noble bodies , let ' em suffer :
The gall of hazard , so they grow together , :
Will never sink ; they must not , say they could . :
A willing man dies sleeping and all 's done . :
ARCITE :
Shall we make worthy uses of this place :
That all men hate so much ? :
PALAMON How , gentle cousin ? :
ARCITE :
Let 's think this prison holy sanctuary :
To keep us from corruption of worse men . :
We are young and yet desire the ways of honor :
That liberty and common conversation , :
The poison of pure spirits , might like women :
Woo us to wander from . What worthy blessing :
Can be but our imaginations :
May make it ours ? And here being thus together , :
We are an endless mine to one another ; :
We are one another 's wife , ever begetting :
New births of love ; we are father , friends , :
acquaintance ; :
We are , in one another , families ; :
I am your heir , and you are mine . This place :
Is our inheritance ; no hard oppressor :
Dare take this from us ; here with a little patience :
We shall live long and loving . No surfeits seek us ; :
The hand of war hurts none here , nor the seas :
Swallow their youth . Were we at liberty , :
A wife might part us lawfully , or business ; :
Quarrels consume us ; envy of ill men :
Crave our acquaintance . I might sicken , cousin , :
Where you should never know it , and so perish :
Without your noble hand to close mine eyes , :
Or prayers to the gods . A thousand chances , :
Were we from hence , would sever us . :
PALAMON You have made :
me-- :
I thank you , cousin Arcite--almost wanton :
With my captivity . What a misery :
It is to live abroad and everywhere ! :
'Tis like a beast , methinks . I find the court here , :
I am sure , a more content ; and all those pleasures :
That woo the wills of men to vanity :
I see through now , and am sufficient :
To tell the world ' tis but a gaudy shadow :
That old Time as he passes by takes with him . :
What had we been , old in the court of Creon , :
Where sin is justice , lust and ignorance :
The virtues of the great ones ? Cousin Arcite , :
Had not the loving gods found this place for us , :
We had died as they do , ill old men , unwept , :
And had their epitaphs , the people 's curses . :
Shall I say more ? :
ARCITE I would hear you still . :
PALAMON You shall . :
Is there record of any two that loved :
Better than we do , Arcite ? :
