That have died manly , which will seek of me :
Some news from Earth , they shall get none but this : :
That thou art brave and noble . :
ARCITE Be content . :
Again betake you to your hawthorn house . :
With counsel of the night I will be here :
With wholesome viands . These impediments :
Will I file off . You shall have garments and :
Perfumes to kill the smell o ' th ' prison . After , :
When you shall stretch yourself and say but " Arcite , :
I am in plight , " there shall be at your choice :
Both sword and armor . :
PALAMON O you heavens , dares any :
So noble bear a guilty business ? None :
But only Arcite . Therefore none but Arcite :
In this kind is so bold . :
ARCITE Sweet Palamon . :
PALAMON :
I do embrace you and your offer ; for :
Your offer do ' t I only . Sir , your person :
Without hypocrisy I may not wish :
More than my sword 's edge on ' t . :
[ Wind horns off ; sound cornets . ] :
ARCITE You hear the horns . :
Be crossed ere met . Give me your hand ; farewell . :
I 'll bring you every needful thing . I pray you , :
Take comfort and be strong . :
PALAMON Pray hold your promise , :
And do the deed with a bent brow . Most certain :
You love me not ; be rough with me , and pour :
This oil out of your language . By this air , :
I could for each word give a cuff , my stomach :
Not reconciled by reason . :
ARCITE Plainly spoken , :
Yet pardon me hard language . When I spur :
My horse , I chide him not ; content and anger :
In me have but one face . [ Wind horns . ] :
Hark , sir , they call :
The scattered to the banquet ; you must guess :
I have an office there . :
PALAMON Sir , your attendance :
Cannot please heaven , and I know your office :
Unjustly is achieved . :
ARCITE ' Tis a good title . :
I am persuaded this question , sick between ' s , :
By bleeding must be cured . I am a suitor :
That to your sword you will bequeath this plea , :
And talk of it no more . :
PALAMON But this one word : :
You are going now to gaze upon my mistress , :
For note you , mine she is-- :
ARCITE Nay then , -- :
PALAMON Nay , pray you , :
You talk of feeding me to breed me strength . :
You are going now to look upon a sun :
That strengthens what it looks on ; there :
You have a vantage o 'er me , but enjoy ' t till :
I may enforce my remedy . Farewell . :
[ They exit . ] :
Scene 2 :

[ Enter Jailer 's Daughter , alone . ] :
DAUGHTER :
He has mistook the brake I meant , is gone :
After his fancy . ' Tis now well-nigh morning . :
No matter ; would it were perpetual night , :
And darkness lord o ' th ' world . Hark , ' tis a wolf ! :
In me hath grief slain fear , and but for one thing , :
I care for nothing , and that 's Palamon . :
I reck not if the wolves would jaw me , so :
He had this file . What if I hallowed for him ? :
I cannot hallow . If I whooped , what then ? :
If he not answered , I should call a wolf , :
And do him but that service . I have heard :
Strange howls this livelong night ; why may ' t not be :
They have made prey of him ? He has no weapons ; :
He cannot run ; the jingling of his gyves :
Might call fell things to listen , who have in them :
A sense to know a man unarmed and can :
