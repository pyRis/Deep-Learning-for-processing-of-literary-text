The Duke unexpectedly banishes Rosalind and she decides to find her father, the real Duke, who has been overthrown by his brother, Celia¡¯s father, Frederick. Duke Senior lives in the forest of Arden. Together with the court jester, Touchstone, the girls set out, disguised as a country boy, Ganymede, and his sister, Aliena.

In the forest, the group from the court encounters a young shepherd, Silvius, and watch him being rejected by a shepherdess, Phoebe, as he declares his love for her.
