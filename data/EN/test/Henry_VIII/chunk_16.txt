KING HENRY VIII : Go thy ways , Kate : That man i ' the world who shall report he has A better wife , let him in nought be trusted , For speaking false in that : thou art , alone , If thy rare qualities , sweet gentleness , Thy meekness saint-like , wife-like government , Obeying in commanding , and thy parts Sovereign and pious else , could speak thee out , The queen of earthly queens : she 's noble born ; And , like her true nobility , she has Carried herself towards me .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Most gracious sir , In humblest manner I require your highness , That it shall please you to declare , in hearing Of all these ears , --for where I am robb 'd and bound , There must I be unloosed , although not there At once and fully satisfied , --whether ever I Did broach this business to your highness ; or Laid any scruple in your way , which might Induce you to the question on 't ? or ever Have to you , but with thanks to God for such A royal lady , spake one the least word that might Be to the prejudice of her present state , Or touch of her good person ?
KING HENRY VIII : My lord cardinal , I do excuse you ; yea , upon mine honour , I free you from 't . You are not to be taught That you have many enemies , that know not Why they are so , but , like to village-curs , Bark when their fellows do : by some of these The queen is put in anger . You 're excused : But will you be more justified ? You ever Have wish 'd the sleeping of this business ; never desired It to be stirr 'd ; but oft have hinder 'd , oft , The passages made toward it : on my honour , I speak my good lord cardinal to this point , And thus far clear him . Now , what moved me to 't , I will be bold with time and your attention : Then mark the inducement . Thus it came ; give heed to 't : My conscience first received a tenderness , Scruple , and prick , on certain speeches utter 'd By the Bishop of Bayonne , then French ambassador ; Who had been hither sent on the debating A marriage ' twixt the Duke of Orleans and Our daughter Mary : i ' the progress of this business , Ere a determinate resolution , he , I mean the bishop , did require a respite ; Wherein he might the king his lord advertise Whether our daughter were legitimate , Respecting this our marriage with the dowager , Sometimes our brother 's wife . This respite shook The bosom of my conscience , enter 'd me , Yea , with a splitting power , and made to tremble The region of my breast ; which forced such way , That many mazed considerings did throng And press 'd in with this caution . First , methought I stood not in the smile of heaven ; who had Commanded nature , that my lady 's womb , If it conceived a male child by me , should Do no more offices of life to 't than The grave does to the dead ; for her male issue Or died where they were made , or shortly after This world had air 'd them : hence I took a thought , This was a judgment on me ; that my kingdom , Well worthy the best heir o ' the world , should not Be gladded in 't by me : then follows , that I weigh 'd the danger which my realms stood in By this my issue 's fail ; and that gave to me Many a groaning throe . Thus hulling in The wild sea of my conscience , I did steer Toward this remedy , whereupon we are Now present here together : that 's to say , I meant to rectify my conscience , --which I then did feel full sick , and yet not well , -- By all the reverend fathers of the land And doctors learn 'd : first I began in private With you , my Lord of Lincoln ; you remember How under my oppression I did reek , When I first moved you .
