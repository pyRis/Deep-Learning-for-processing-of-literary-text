CARDINAL WOLSEY : You have here , lady , And of your choice , these reverend fathers ; men Of singular integrity and learning , Yea , the elect o ' the land , who are assembled To plead your cause : it shall be therefore bootless That longer you desire the court ; as well For your own quiet , as to rectify What is unsettled in the king .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : His grace Hath spoken well and justly : therefore , madam , It 's fit this royal session do proceed ; And that , without delay , their arguments Be now produced and heard .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Lord cardinal , To you I speak .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Your pleasure , madam ?
QUEEN KATHARINE : Sir , I am about to weep ; but , thinking that We are a queen , or long have dream 'd so , certain The daughter of a king , my drops of tears I 'll turn to sparks of fire .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Be patient yet .
QUEEN KATHARINE : I will , when you are humble ; nay , before , Or God will punish me . I do believe , Induced by potent circumstances , that You are mine enemy , and make my challenge You shall not be my judge : for it is you Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me ; Which God 's dew quench ! Therefore I say again , I utterly abhor , yea , from my soul Refuse you for my judge ; whom , yet once more , I hold my most malicious foe , and think not At all a friend to truth .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : I do profess You speak not like yourself ; who ever yet Have stood to charity , and display 'd the effects Of disposition gentle , and of wisdom O 'ertopping woman 's power . Madam , you do me wrong : I have no spleen against you ; nor injustice For you or any : how far I have proceeded , Or how far further shall , is warranted By a commission from the consistory , Yea , the whole consistory of Rome . You charge me That I have blown this coal : I do deny it : The king is present : if it be known to him That I gainsay my deed , how may he wound , And worthily , my falsehood ! yea , as much As you have done my truth . If he know That I am free of your report , he knows I am not of your wrong . Therefore in him It lies to cure me : and the cure is , to Remove these thoughts from you : the which before His highness shall speak in , I do beseech You , gracious madam , to unthink your speaking And to say so no more .
QUEEN KATHARINE : My lord , my lord , I am a simple woman , much too weak To oppose your cunning . You 're meek and humble-mouth 'd ; You sign your place and calling , in full seeming , With meekness and humility ; but your heart Is cramm 'd with arrogancy , spleen , and pride . You have , by fortune and his highness ' favours , Gone slightly o 'er low steps and now are mounted Where powers are your retainers , and your words , Domestics to you , serve your will as 't please Yourself pronounce their office . I must tell you , You tender more your person 's honour than Your high profession spiritual : that again I do refuse you for my judge ; and here , Before you all , appeal unto the pope , To bring my whole cause ' fore his holiness , And to be judged by him . She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII , and offers to depart
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : The queen is obstinate , Stubborn to justice , apt to accuse it , and Disdainful to be tried by 't : ' tis not well . She 's going away .
KING HENRY VIII : Call her again .
Crier : Katharine Queen of England , come into the court .
GRIFFITH : Madam , you are call 'd back .
