LINCOLN : Very well , my liege .
KING HENRY VIII : I have spoke long : be pleased yourself to say How far you satisfied me .
LINCOLN : So please your highness , The question did at first so stagger me , Bearing a state of mighty moment in 't And consequence of dread , that I committed The daring 'st counsel which I had to doubt ; And did entreat your highness to this course Which you are running here .
KING HENRY VIII : I then moved you , My Lord of Canterbury ; and got your leave To make this present summons : unsolicited I left no reverend person in this court ; But by particular consent proceeded Under your hands and seals : therefore , go on : For no dislike i ' the world against the person Of the good queen , but the sharp thorny points Of my alleged reasons , drive this forward : Prove but our marriage lawful , by my life And kingly dignity , we are contented To wear our mortal state to come with her , Katharine our queen , before the primest creature That 's paragon 'd o ' the world .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : So please your highness , The queen being absent , ' tis a needful fitness That we adjourn this court till further day : Meanwhile must be an earnest motion Made to the queen , to call back her appeal She intends unto his holiness .
KING HENRY VIII : I may perceive These cardinals trifle with me : I abhor This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome . My learn 'd and well-beloved servant , Cranmer , Prithee , return : with thy approach , I know , My comfort comes along . Break up the court : I say , set on . Enter QUEEN KATHARINE and her Women , as at work
QUEEN KATHARINE : Take thy lute , wench : my soul grows sad with troubles ; Sing , and disperse ' em , if thou canst : leave working . SONG Orpheus with his lute made trees , And the mountain tops that freeze , Bow themselves when he did sing : To his music plants and flowers Ever sprung ; as sun and showers There had made a lasting spring . Every thing that heard him play , Even the billows of the sea , Hung their heads , and then lay by . In sweet music is such art , Killing care and grief of heart Fall asleep , or hearing , die . Enter a Gentleman
QUEEN KATHARINE : How now !
Gentleman : An 't please your grace , the two great cardinals Wait in the presence .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Would they speak with me ?
Gentleman : They will 'd me say so , madam .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Pray their graces To come near . Exit Gentleman What can be their business With me , a poor weak woman , fall 'n from favour ? I do not like their coming . Now I think on 't , They should be good men ; their affairs as righteous : But all hoods make not monks . Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Peace to your highness !
QUEEN KATHARINE : Your graces find me here part of a housewife , I would be all , against the worst may happen . What are your pleasures with me , reverend lords ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : May it please you noble madam , to withdraw Into your private chamber , we shall give you The full cause of our coming .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Speak it here : There 's nothing I have done yet , o ' my conscience , Deserves a corner : would all other women Could speak this with as free a soul as I do ! My lords , I care not , so much I am happy Above a number , if my actions Were tried by every tongue , every eye saw ' em , Envy and base opinion set against ' em , I know my life so even . If your business Seek me out , and that way I am wife in , Out with it boldly : truth loves open dealing .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Tanta est erga te mentis integritas , regina serenissima , --
