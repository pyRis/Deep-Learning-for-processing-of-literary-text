CAPUCIUS : Madam , in good health .
KATHARINE : So may he ever do ! and ever flourish , When I shal l dwell with worms , and my poor name Banish 'd the kingdom ! Patience , is that letter , I caused you write , yet sent away ?
PATIENCE : No , madam . Giving it to KATHARINE
KATHARINE : Sir , I most humbly pray you to deliver This to my lord the king .
CAPUCIUS : Most willing , madam .
KATHARINE : In which I have commended to his goodness The model of our chaste loves , his young daughter ; The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her ! Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding-- She is young , and of a noble modest nature , I hope she will deserve well , --and a little To love her for her mother 's sake , that loved him , Heaven knows how dearly . My next poor petition Is , that his noble grace would have some pity Upon my wretched women , that so long Have follow 'd both my fortunes faithfully : Of which there is not one , I dare avow , And now I should not lie , but will deserve For virtue and true beauty of the soul , For honesty and decent carriage , A right good husband , let him be a noble And , sure , those men are happy that shall have ' em . The last is , for my men ; they are the poorest , But poverty could never draw ' em from me ; That they may have their wages duly paid ' em , And something over to remember me by : If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life And able means , we had not parted thus . These are the whole contents : and , good my lord , By that you love the dearest in this world , As you wish Christian peace to souls departed , Stand these poor people 's friend , and urge the king To do me this last right .
CAPUCIUS : By heaven , I will , Or let me lose the fashion of a man !
KATHARINE : I thank you , honest lord . Remember me In all humility unto his highness : Say his long trouble now is passing Out of this world ; tell him , in death I bless 'd him , For so I will . Mine eyes grow dim . Farewell , My lord . Griffith , farewell . Nay , Patience , You must not leave me yet : I must to bed ; Call in more women . When I am dead , good wench , Let me be used with honour : strew me over With maiden flowers , that all the world may know I was a chaste wife to my grave : embalm me , Then lay me forth : although unqueen 'd , yet like A queen , and daughter to a king , inter me . I can no more . Enter GARDINER , Bishop of Winchester , a Page with a torch before him , met by LOVELL
GARDINER : It 's one o 'clock , boy , is 't not ?
Boy : It hath struck .
GARDINER : These should be hours for necessities , Not for delights ; times to repair our nature With comforting repose , and not for us To waste these times . Good hour of night , Sir Thomas ! Whither so late ?
LOVELL : Came you from the king , my lord
GARDINER : I did , Sir Thomas : and left him at primero With the Duke of Suffolk .
LOVELL : I must to him too , Before he go to bed . I 'll take my leave .
GARDINER : Not yet , Sir Thomas Lovell . What 's the matter ? It seems you are in haste : an if there be No great offence belongs to 't , give your friend Some touch of your late business : affairs , that walk , As they say spirits do , at midnight , have In them a wilder nature than the business That seeks dispatch by day .
