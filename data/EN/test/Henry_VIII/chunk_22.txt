CARDINAL WOLSEY : And ever may your highness yoke together , As I will lend you cause , my doing well With my well saying !
KING HENRY VIII : ' Tis well said again ; And ' tis a kind of good deed to say well : And yet words are no deeds . My father loved you : His said he did ; and with his deed did crown His word upon you . Since I had my office , I have kept you next my heart ; have not alone Employ 'd you where high profits might come home , But pared my present havings , to bestow My bounties upon you .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : What should this mean ?
SURREY : The Lord increase this business !
KING HENRY VIII : Have I not made you , The prime man of the state ? I pray you , tell me , If what I now pronounce you have found true : And , if you may confess it , say withal , If you are bound to us or no . What say you ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : My sovereign , I confess your royal graces , Shower 'd on me daily , have been more than could My studied purposes requite ; which went Beyond all man 's endeavours : my endeavours Have ever come too short of my desires , Yet filed with my abilities : mine own ends Have been mine so that evermore they pointed To the good of your most sacred person and The profit of the state . For your great graces Heap 'd upon me , poor undeserver , I Can nothing render but allegiant thanks , My prayers to heaven for you , my loyalty , Which ever has and ever shall be growing , Till death , that winter , kill it .
KING HENRY VIII : Fairly answer 'd ; A loyal and obedient subject is Therein illustrated : the honour of it Does pay the act of it ; as , i ' the contrary , The foulness is the punishment . I presume That , as my hand has open 'd bounty to you , My heart dropp 'd love , my power rain 'd honour , more On you than any ; so your hand and heart , Your brain , and every function of your power , Should , notwithstanding that your bond of duty , As ' twere in love 's particular , be more To me , your friend , than any .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : I do profess That for your highness ' good I ever labour 'd More than mine own ; that am , have , and will be-- Though all the world should crack their duty to you , And throw it from their soul ; though perils did Abound , as thick as thought could make ' em , and Appear in forms more horrid , --yet my duty , As doth a rock against the chiding flood , Should the approach of this wild river break , And stand unshaken yours .
KING HENRY VIII : ' Tis nobly spoken : Take notice , lords , he has a loyal breast , For you have seen him open 't . Read o 'er this ; Giving him papers And after , this : and then to breakfast with What appetite you have . Exit KING HENRY VIII , frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY : the Nobles throng after him , smiling and whispering
