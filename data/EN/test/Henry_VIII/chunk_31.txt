LOVELL : My lord , I love you ; And durst commend a secret to your ear Much weightier than this work . The queen 's in labour , They say , in great extremity ; and fear 'd She 'll with the labour end .
GARDINER : The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily , that it may find Good time , and live : but for the stock , Sir Thomas , I wish it grubb 'd up now .
LOVELL : Methinks I could Cry the amen ; and yet my conscience says She 's a good creature , and , sweet lady , does Deserve our better wishes .
GARDINER : But , sir , sir , Hear me , Sir Thomas : you 're a gentleman Of mine own way ; I know you wise , religious ; And , let me tell you , it will ne 'er be well , ' Twill not , Sir Thomas Lovell , take 't of me , Till Cranmer , Cromwell , her two hands , and she , Sleep in their graves .
LOVELL : Now , sir , you speak of two The most remark 'd i ' the kingdom . As for Cromwell , Beside that of the jewel house , is made master O ' the rolls , and the king 's secretary ; further , sir , Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments , With which the time will load him . The archbishop Is the king 's hand and tongue ; and who dare speak One syllable against him ?
GARDINER : Yes , yes , Sir Thomas , There are that dare ; and I myself have ventured To speak my mind of him : and indeed this day , Sir , I may tell it you , I think I have Incensed the lords o ' the council , that he is , For so I know he is , they know he is , A most arch heretic , a pestilence That does infect the land : with which they moved Have broken with the king ; who hath so far Given ear to our complaint , of his great grace And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs Our reasons laid before him , hath commanded To-morrow morning to the council-board He be convented . He 's a rank weed , Sir Thomas , And we must root him out . From your affairs I hinder you too long : good night , Sir Thomas .
LOVELL : Many good nights , my lord : I rest your servant . Enter KING HENRY VIII and SUFFOLK
KING HENRY VIII : Charles , I will play no more tonight ; My mind 's not on 't ; you are too hard for me .
SUFFOLK : Sir , I did never win of you before .
KING HENRY VIII : But little , Charles ; Nor shall not , when my fancy 's on my play . Now , Lovell , from the queen what is the news ?
LOVELL : I could not personally deliver to her What you commanded me , but by her woman I sent your message ; who return 'd her thanks In the great 'st humbleness , and desired your highness Most heartily to pray for her .
KING HENRY VIII : What say 'st thou , ha ? To pray for her ? what , is she crying out ?
LOVELL : So said her woman ; and that her sufferance made Almost each pang a death .
KING HENRY VIII : Alas , good lady !
SUFFOLK : God safely quit her of her burthen , and With gentle travail , to the gladding of Your highness with an heir !
KING HENRY VIII : ' Tis midnight , Charles ; Prithee , to bed ; and in thy prayers remember The estate of my poor queen . Leave me alone ; For I must think of that which company Would not be friendly to .
SUFFOLK : I wish your highness A quiet night ; and my good mistress will Remember in my prayers .
KING HENRY VIII : Charles , good night . Exit SUFFOLK Enter DENNY Well , sir , what follows ?

DENNY : He attends your highness ' pleasure . Exit DENNY
LOVELL : This is about that which the bishop spake : I am happily come hither . Re-enter DENNY , with CRANMER
