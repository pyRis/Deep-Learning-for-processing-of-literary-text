SUFFOLK : Which of the peers Have uncontemn 'd gone by him , or at least Strangely neglected ? when did he regard The stamp of nobleness in any person Out of himself ?
Chamberlain : My lords , you speak your pleasures : What he deserves of you and me I know ; What we can do to him , though now the time Gives way to us , I much fear . If you cannot Bar his access to the king , never attempt Any thing on him ; for he hath a witchcraft Over the king in 's tongue .
NORFOLK : O , fear him not ; His spell in that is out : the king hath found Matter against him that for ever mars The honey of his language . No , he 's settled , Not to come off , in his displeasure .
SURREY : Sir , I should be glad to hear such news as this Once every hour .
NORFOLK : Believe it , this is true : In the divorce his contrary proceedings Are all unfolded wherein he appears As I would wish mine enemy .
SURREY : How came His practises to light ?
SUFFOLK : Most strangely .
SURREY : O , how , how ?
SUFFOLK : The cardinal 's letters to the pope miscarried , And came to the eye o ' the king : wherein was read , How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness To stay the judgment o ' the divorce ; for if It did take place , ' I do , ' quoth he , ' perceive My king is tangled in affection to A creature of the queen 's , Lady Anne Bullen . ' 
SURREY : Has the king this ?
SUFFOLK : Believe it .
SURREY : Will this work ?
Chamberlain : The king in this perceives him , how he coasts And hedges his own way . But in this point All his tricks founder , and he brings his physic After his patient 's death : the king already Hath married the fair lady .
SURREY : Would he had !
SUFFOLK : May you be happy in your wish , my lord For , I profess , you have it .
SURREY : Now , all my joy Trace the conjunction !
SUFFOLK : My amen to 't !
NORFOLK : All men 's !
SUFFOLK : There 's order given for her coronation : Marry , this is yet but young , and may be left To some ears unrecounted . But , my lords , She is a gallant creature , and complete In mind and feature : I persuade me , from her Will fall some blessing to this land , which shall In it be memorised .
SURREY : But , will the king Digest this letter of the cardinal 's ? The Lord forbid !
NORFOLK : Marry , amen !
SUFFOLK : No , no ; There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose Will make this sting the sooner . Cardinal Campeius Is stol 'n away to Rome ; hath ta 'en no leave ; Has left the cause o ' the king unhandled ; and Is posted , as the agent of our cardinal , To second all his plot . I do assure you The king cried Ha ! at this .
Chamberlain : Now , God incense him , And let him cry Ha ! louder !
NORFOLK : But , my lord , When returns Cranmer ?
SUFFOLK : He is return 'd in his opinions ; which Have satisfied the king for his divorce , Together with all famous colleges Almost in Christendom : shortly , I believe , His second marriage shall be publish 'd , and Her coronation . Katharine no more Shall be call 'd queen , but princess dowager And widow to Prince Arthur .
NORFOLK : This same Cranmer 's A worthy fellow , and hath ta 'en much pain In the king 's business .
SUFFOLK : He has ; and we shall see him For it an archbishop .
NORFOLK : So I hear .
SUFFOLK : ' Tis so . The cardinal ! Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL
NORFOLK : Observe , observe , he 's moody .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : The packet , Cromwell . Gave 't you the king ?
CROMWELL : To his own hand , in 's bedchamber .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Look 'd he o ' the inside of the paper ?
