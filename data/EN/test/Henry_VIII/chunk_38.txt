CRANMER : And to your royal grace , and the good queen , My noble partners , and myself , thus pray : All comfort , joy , in this most gracious lady , Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy , May hourly fall upon ye !
KING HENRY VIII : Thank you , good lord archbishop : What is her name ?
CRANMER : Elizabeth .
KING HENRY VIII : Stand up , lord . KING HENRY VIII kisses the child With this kiss take my blessing : God protect thee ! Into whose hand I give thy life .
CRANMER : Amen .
KING HENRY VIII : My noble gossips , ye have been too prodigal : I thank ye heartily ; so shall this lady , When she has so much English .
CRANMER : Let me speak , sir , For heaven now bids me ; and the words I utter Let none think flattery , for they 'll find ' em truth . This royal infant--heaven still move about her ! -- Though in her cradle , yet now promises Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings , Which time shall bring to ripeness : she shall be-- But few now living can behold that goodness-- A pattern to all princes living with her , And all that shall succeed : Saba was never More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue Than this pure soul shall be : all princely graces , That mould up such a mighty piece as this is , With all the virtues that attend the good , Shall still be doubled on her : truth shall nurse her , Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her : She shall be loved and fear 'd : her own shall bless her ; Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn , And hang their heads with sorrow : good grows with her : In her days every man shall eat in safety , Under his own vine , what he plants ; and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours : God shall be truly known ; and those about her From her shall read the perfect ways of honour , And by those claim their greatness , not by blood . Nor shall this peace sleep with her : but as when The bird of wonder dies , the maiden phoenix , Her ashes new create another heir , As great in admiration as herself ; So shall she leave her blessedness to one , When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness , Who from the sacred ashes of her honour Shall star-like rise , as great in fame as she was , And so stand fix 'd : peace , plenty , love , truth , terror , That were the servants to this chosen infant , Shall then be his , and like a vine grow to him : Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine , His honour and the greatness of his name Shall be , and make new nations : he shall flourish , And , like a mountain cedar , reach his branches To all the plains about him : our children 's children Shall see this , and bless heaven .
KING HENRY VIII : Thou speakest wonders .
CRANMER : She shall be , to the happiness of England , An aged princess ; many days shall see her , And yet no day without a deed to crown it . Would I had known no more ! but she must die , She must , the saints must have her ; yet a virgin , A most unspotted lily shall she pass To the ground , and all the world shall mourn her .
