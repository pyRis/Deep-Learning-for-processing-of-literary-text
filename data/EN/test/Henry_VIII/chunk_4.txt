KING HENRY VIII : Things done well , And with a care , exempt themselves from fear ; Things done without example , in their issue Are to be fear 'd . Have you a precedent Of this commission ? I believe , not any . We must not rend our subjects from our laws , And stick them in our will . Sixth part of each ? A trembling contribution ! Why , we take From every tree lop , bark , and part o ' the timber ; And , though we leave it with a root , thus hack 'd , The air will drink the sap . To every county Where this is question 'd send our letters , with Free pardon to each man that has denied The force of this commission : pray , look to 't ; I put it to your care .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : A word with you . To the Secretary Let there be letters writ to every shire , Of the king 's grace and pardon . The grieved commons Hardly conceive of me ; let it be noised That through our intercession this revokement And pardon comes : I shall anon advise you Further in the proceeding . Exit Secretary Enter Surveyor
QUEEN KATHARINE : I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham Is run in your displeasure .
KING HENRY VIII : It grieves many : The gentleman is learn 'd , and a most rare speaker ; To nature none more bound ; his training such , That he may furnish and instruct great teachers , And never seek for aid out of himself . Yet see , When these so noble benefits shall prove Not well disposed , the mind growing once corrupt , They turn to vicious forms , ten times more ugly Than ever they were fair . This man so complete , Who was enroll 'd ' mongst wonders , and when we , Almost with ravish 'd listening , could not find His hour of speech a minute ; he , my lady , Hath into monstrous habits put the graces That once were his , and is become as black As if besmear 'd in hell . Sit by us ; you shall hear-- This was his gentleman in trust--of him Things to strike honour sad . Bid him recount The fore-recited practises ; whereof We cannot feel too little , hear too much .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Stand forth , and with bold spirit relate what you , Most like a careful subject , have collected Out of the Duke of Buckingham .
KING HENRY VIII : Speak freely .
Surveyor : First , it was usual with him , every day It would infect his speech , that if the king Should without issue die , he 'll carry it so To make the sceptre his : these very words I 've heard him utter to his son-in-law , Lord Abergavenny ; to whom by oath he menaced Revenge upon the cardinal .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Please your highness , note This dangerous conception in this point . Not friended by by his wish , to your high person His will is most malignant ; and it stretches Beyond you , to your friends .
QUEEN KATHARINE : My learn 'd lord cardinal , Deliver all with charity .
KING HENRY VIII : Speak on : How grounded he his title to the crown , Upon our fail ? to this point hast thou heard him At any time speak aught ?
Surveyor : He was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins .
KING HENRY VIII : What was that Hopkins ?
Surveyor : Sir , a Chartreux friar , His confessor , who fed him every minute With words of sovereignty .
KING HENRY VIII : How know 'st thou this ?
