Chamberlain : I will , my lord . Whispers the Masquers
CARDINAL WOLSEY : What say they ?

Let the music knock it . Enter two Gentlemen , meeting
First Gentleman : Whither away so fast ?
Second Gentleman : O , God save ye ! Even to the hall , to hear what shall become Of the great Duke of Buckingham .
First Gentleman : I 'll save you That labour , sir . All 's now done , but the ceremony Of bringing back the prisoner .
Second Gentleman : Were you there ?
First Gentleman : Yes , indeed , was I.
Second Gentleman : Pray , speak what has happen 'd .
First Gentleman : You may guess quickly what .
Second Gentleman : Is he found guilty ?
First Gentleman : Yes , truly is he , and condemn 'd upon 't .
Second Gentleman : I am sorry for 't .
First Gentleman : So are a number more .
Second Gentleman : But , pray , how pass 'd it ?
First Gentleman : I 'll tell you in a little . The great duke Came to the bar ; where to his accusations He pleaded still not guilty and alleged Many sharp reasons to defeat the law . The king 's attorney on the contrary Urged on the examinations , proofs , confessions Of divers witnesses ; which the duke desired To have brought viva voce to his face : At which appear 'd against him his surveyor ; Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor ; and John Car , Confessor to him ; with that devil-monk , Hopkins , that made this mischief .
Second Gentleman : That was he That fed him with his prophecies ?
First Gentleman : The same . All these accused him strongly ; which he fain Would have flung from him , but , indeed , he could not : And so his peers , upon this evidence , Have found him guilty of high treason . Much He spoke , and learnedly , for life ; but all Was either pitied in him or forgotten .
Second Gentleman : After all this , how did he bear himself ?
First Gentleman : When he was brought again to the bar , to hear His knell rung out , his judgment , he was stirr 'd With such an agony , he sweat extremely , And something spoke in choler , ill , and hasty : But he fell to himself again , and sweetly In all the rest show 'd a most noble patience .
