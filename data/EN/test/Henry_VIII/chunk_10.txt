BUCKINGHAM : Nay , Sir Nicholas , Let it alone ; my state now will but mock me . When I came hither , I was lord high constable And Duke of Buckingham ; now , poor Edward Bohun : Yet I am richer than my base accusers , That never knew what truth meant : I now seal it ; And with that blood will make ' em one day groan for 't . My noble father , Henry of Buckingham , Who first raised head against usurping Richard , Flying for succor to his servant Banister , Being distress 'd , was by that wretch betray 'd , And without trial fell ; God 's peace be with him ! Henry the Seventh succeeding , truly pitying My father 's loss , like a most royal prince , Restored me to my honours , and , out of ruins , Made my name once more noble . Now his son , Henry the Eighth , life , honour , name and all That made me happy at one stroke has taken For ever from the world . I had my trial , And , must needs say , a noble one ; which makes me , A little happier than my wretched father : Yet thus far we are one in fortunes : both Fell by our servants , by those men we loved most ; A most unnatural and faithless service ! Heaven has an end in all : yet , you that hear me , This from a dying man receive as certain : Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels Be sure you be not loose ; for those you make friends And give your hearts to , when they once perceive The least rub in your fortunes , fall away Like water from ye , never found again But where they mean to sink ye . All good people , Pray for me ! I must now forsake ye : the last hour Of my long weary life is come upon me . Farewell : And when you would say something that is sad , Speak how I fell . I have done ; and God forgive me !
First Gentleman : O , this is full of pity ! Sir , it calls , I fear , too many curses on their beads That were the authors .
Second Gentleman : If the duke be guiltless , ' Tis full of woe : yet I can give you inkling Of an ensuing evil , if it fall , Greater than this .
First Gentleman : Good angels keep it from us ! What may it be ? You do not doubt my faith , sir ?
Second Gentleman : This secret is so weighty , ' twill require A strong faith to conceal it .
First Gentleman : Let me have it ; I do not talk much .
Second Gentleman : I am confident , You shall , sir : did you not of late days hear A buzzing of a separation Between the king and Katharine ?
First Gentleman : Yes , but it held not : For when the king once heard it , out of anger He sent command to the lord mayor straight To stop the rumor , and allay those tongues That durst disperse it .
Second Gentleman : But that slander , sir , Is found a truth now : for it grows again Fresher than e 'er it was ; and held for certain The king will venture at it . Either the cardinal , Or some about him near , have , out of malice To the good queen , possess 'd him with a scruple That will undo her : to confirm this too , Cardinal Campeius is arrived , and lately ; As all think , for this business .
First Gentleman : ' Tis the cardinal ; And merely to revenge him on the emperor For not bestowing on him , at his asking , The archbishopric of Toledo , this is purposed .
Second Gentleman : I think you have hit the mark : but is 't not cruel That she should feel the smart of this ? The cardinal Will have his will , and she must fall .
First Gentleman : ' Tis woful . We are too open here to argue this ; Let 's think in private more . Enter Chamberlain , reading a letter
Chamberlain : ' My lord , the horses your lordship sent for , with all the care I had , I saw well chosen , ridden , and furnished . They were young and handsome , and of the best breed in the north . When they were ready to set out for London , a man of my lord cardinal 's , by commission and main power , took ' em from me ; with this reason : His master would be served before a subject , if not before the king ; which stopped our mouths , sir . ' I fear he will indeed : well , let him have them : He will have all , I think . Enter , to Chamberlain , NORFOLK and SUFFOLK
NORFOLK : Well met , my lord chamberlain .
Chamberlain : Good day to both your graces .
SUFFOLK : How is the king employ 'd ?
Chamberlain : I left him private , Full of sad thoughts and troubles .
NORFOLK : What 's the cause ?
Chamberlain : It seems the marriage with his brother 's wife Has crept too near his conscience .
SUFFOLK : No , his conscience Has crept too near another lady .
NORFOLK : ' Tis so : This is the cardinal 's doing , the king-cardinal : That blind priest , like the eldest son of fortune , Turns what he list . The king will know him one day .
SUFFOLK : Pray God he do ! he 'll never know himself else .
