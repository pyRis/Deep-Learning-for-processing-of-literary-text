BUCKINGHAM : Why the devil , Upon this French going out , took he upon him , Without the privity o ' the king , to appoint Who should attend on him ? He makes up the file Of all the gentry ; for the most part such To whom as great a charge as little honour He meant to lay upon : and his own letter , The honourable board of council out , Must fetch him in the papers .
ABERGAVENNY : I do know Kinsmen of mine , three at the least , that have By this so sickened their estates , that never They shall abound as formerly .
BUCKINGHAM : O , many Have broke their backs with laying manors on ' em For this great journey . What did this vanity But minister communication of A most poor issue ?
NORFOLK : Grievingly I think , The peace between the French and us not values The cost that did conclude it .
BUCKINGHAM : Every man , After the hideous storm that follow 'd , was A thing inspired ; and , not consulting , broke Into a general prophecy ; That this tempest , Dashing the garment of this peace , aboded The sudden breach on 't .
NORFOLK : Which is budded out ; For France hath flaw 'd the league , and hath attach 'd Our merchants ' goods at Bourdeaux .
ABERGAVENNY : Is it therefore The ambassador is silenced ?
NORFOLK : Marry , is 't .
ABERGAVENNY : A proper title of a peace ; and purchased At a superfluous rate !
BUCKINGHAM : Why , all this business Our reverend cardinal carried .
NORFOLK : Like it your grace , The state takes notice of the private difference Betwixt you and the cardinal . I advise you-- And take it from a heart that wishes towards you Honour and plenteous safety--that you read The cardinal 's malice and his potency Together ; to consider further that What his high hatred would effect wants not A minister in his power . You know his nature , That he 's revengeful , and I know his sword Hath a sharp edge : it 's long and , ' t may be said , It reaches far , and where ' twill not extend , Thither he darts it . Bosom up my counsel , You 'll find it wholesome . Lo , where comes that rock That I advise your shunning . Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY , the purse borne before him , certain of the Guard , and two Secretaries with papers . CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM , and BUCKINGHAM on him , both full of disdain
CARDINAL WOLSEY : The Duke of Buckingham 's surveyor , ha ? Where 's his examination ?
First Secretary : Here , so please you .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Is he in person ready ?
First Secretary : Ay , please your grace .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Well , we shall then know more ; and Buckingham Shall lessen this big look .
BUCKINGHAM : This butcher 's cur is venom-mouth 'd , and I Have not the power to muzzle him ; therefore best Not wake him in his slumber . A beggar 's book Outworths a noble 's blood .
NORFOLK : What , are you chafed ? Ask God for temperance ; that 's the appliance only Which your disease requires .
BUCKINGHAM : I read in 's looks Matter against me ; and his eye reviled Me , as his abject object : at this instant He bores me with some trick : he 's gone to the king ; I 'll follow and outstare him .
NORFOLK : Stay , my lord , And let your reason with your choler question What ' tis you go about : to climb steep hills Requires slow pace at first : anger is like A full-hot horse , who being allow 'd his way , Self-mettle tires him . Not a man in England Can advise me like you : be to yourself As you would to your friend .
BUCKINGHAM : I 'll to the king ; And from a mouth of honour quite cry down This Ipswich fellow 's insolence ; or proclaim There 's difference in no persons .
NORFOLK : Be advised ; Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot That it do singe yourself : we may outrun , By violent swiftness , that which we run at , And lose by over-running . Know you not , The fire that mounts the liquor til run o 'er , In seeming to augment it wastes it ? Be advised : I say again , there is no English soul More stronger to direct you than yourself , If with the sap of reason you would quench , Or but allay , the fire of passion .
