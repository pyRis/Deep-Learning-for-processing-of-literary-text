NORFOLK : Hear the king 's pleasure , cardinal : who commands you To render up the great seal presently Into our hands ; and to confine yourself To Asher House , my Lord of Winchester 's , Till you hear further from his highness .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Stay : Where 's your commission , lords ? words cannot carry Authority so weighty .
SUFFOLK : Who dare cross ' em , Bearing the king 's will from his mouth expressly ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Till I find more than will or words to do it , I mean your malice , know , officious lords , I dare and must deny it . Now I feel Of what coarse metal ye are moulded , envy : How eagerly ye follow my disgraces , As if it fed ye ! and how sleek and wanton Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin ! Follow your envious courses , men of malice ; You have Christian warrant for ' em , and , no doubt , In time will find their fit rewards . That seal , You ask with such a violence , the king , Mine and your master , with his own hand gave me ; Bade me enjoy it , with the place and honours , During my life ; and , to confirm his goodness , Tied it by letters-patents : now , who 'll take it ?
SURREY : The king , that gave it .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : It must be himself , then .
SURREY : Thou art a proud traitor , priest .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Proud lord , thou liest : Within these forty hours Surrey durst better Have burnt that tongue than said so .
SURREY : Thy ambition , Thou scarlet sin , robb 'd this bewailing land Of noble Buckingham , my father-in-law : The heads of all thy brother cardinals , With thee and all thy best parts bound together , Weigh 'd not a hair of his . Plague of your policy ! You sent me deputy for Ireland ; Far from his succor , from the king , from all That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him ; Whilst your great goodness , out of holy pity , Absolved him with an axe .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : This , and all else This talking lord can lay upon my credit , I answer is most false . The duke by law Found his deserts : how innocent I was From any private malice in his end , His noble jury and foul cause can witness . If I loved many words , lord , I should tell you You have as little honesty as honour , That in the way of loyalty and truth Toward the king , my ever royal master , Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be , And all that love his follies .
SURREY : By my soul , Your long coat , priest , protects you ; thou shouldst feel My sword i ' the life-blood of thee else . My lords , Can ye endure to hear this arrogance ? And from this fellow ? if we live thus tamely , To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet , Farewell nobility ; let his grace go forward , And dare us with his cap like larks .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : All goodness Is poison to thy stomach .
SURREY : Yes , that goodness Of gleaning all the land 's wealth into one , Into your own hands , cardinal , by extortion ; The goodness of your intercepted packets You writ to the pope against the king : your goodness , Since you provoke me , shall be most notorious . My Lord of Norfolk , as you are truly noble , As you respect the common good , the state Of our despised nobility , our issues , Who , if he live , will scarce be gentlemen , Produce the grand sum of his sins , the articles Collected from his life . I 'll startle you Worse than the scaring bell , when the brown wench Lay kissing in your arms , lord cardinal .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : How much , methinks , I could despise this man , But that I am bound in charity against it !
