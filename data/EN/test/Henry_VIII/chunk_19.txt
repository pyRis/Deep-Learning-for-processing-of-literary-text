CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : Your fears are worse .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself , Since virtue finds no friends--a wife , a true one ? A woman , I dare say without vain-glory , Never yet branded with suspicion ? Have I with all my full affections Still met the king ? loved him next heaven ? obey 'd him ? Been , out of fondness , superstitious to him ? Almost forgot my prayers to content him ? And am I thus rewarded ? ' tis not well , lords . Bring me a constant woman to her husband , One that ne 'er dream 'd a joy beyond his pleasure ; And to that woman , when she has done most , Yet will I add an honour , a great patience .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Madam , you wander from the good we aim at .
QUEEN KATHARINE : My lord , I dare not make myself so guilty , To give up willingly that noble title Your master wed me to : nothing but death Shall e 'er divorce my dignities .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Pray , hear me .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Would I had never trod this English earth , Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it ! Ye have angels ' faces , but heaven knows your hearts . What will become of me now , wretched lady ! I am the most unhappy woman living . Alas , poor wenches , where are now your fortunes ! Shipwreck 'd upon a kingdom , where no pity , No friend , no hope ; no kindred weep for me ; Almost no grave allow 'd me : like the lily , That once was mistress of the field and flourish 'd , I 'll hang my head and perish .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : If your grace Could but be brought to know our ends are honest , You 'ld feel more comfort : why should we , good lady , Upon what cause , wrong you ? alas , our places , The way of our profession is against it : We are to cure such sorrows , not to sow ' em . For goodness ' sake , consider what you do ; How you may hurt yourself , ay , utterly Grow from the king 's acquaintance , by this carriage . The hearts of princes kiss obedience , So much they love it ; but to stubborn spirits They swell , and grow as terrible as storms . I know you have a gentle , noble temper , A soul as even as a calm : pray , think us Those we profess , peace-makers , friends , and servants .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : Madam , you 'll find it so . You wrong your virtues With these weak women 's fears : a noble spirit , As yours was put into you , ever casts Such doubts , as false coin , from it . The king loves you ; Beware you lose it not : for us , if you please To trust us in your business , we are ready To use our utmost studies in your service .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Do what ye will , my lords : and , pray , forgive me , If I have used myself unmannerly ; You know I am a woman , lacking wit To make a seemly answer to such persons . Pray , do my service to his majesty : He has my heart yet ; and shall have my prayers While I shall have my life . Come , reverend fathers , Bestow your counsels on me : she now begs , That little thought , when she set footing here , She should have bought her dignities so dear . Enter NORFOLK , SUFFOLK , SURREY , and Chamberlain
NORFOLK : If you will now unite in your complaints , And force them with a constancy , the cardinal Cannot stand under them : if you omit The offer of this time , I cannot promise But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces , With these you bear already .
SURREY : I am joyful To meet the least occasion that may give me Remembrance of my father-in-law , the duke , To be revenged on him .
