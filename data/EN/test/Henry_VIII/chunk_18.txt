QUEEN KATHARINE : O , good my lord , no Latin ; I am not such a truant since my coming , As not to know the language I have lived in : A strange tongue makes my cause more strange , suspicious ; Pray , speak in English : here are some will thank you , If you speak truth , for their poor mistress ' sake ; Believe me , she has had much wrong : lord cardinal , The willing 'st sin I ever yet committed May be absolved in English .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Noble lady , I am sorry my integrity should breed , And service to his majesty and you , So deep suspicion , where all faith was meant . We come not by the way of accusation , To taint that honour every good tongue blesses , Nor to betray you any way to sorrow , You have too much , good lady ; but to know How you stand minded in the weighty difference Between the king and you ; and to deliver , Like free and honest men , our just opinions And comforts to your cause .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : Most honour 'd madam , My Lord of York , out of his noble nature , Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace , Forgetting , like a good man your late censure Both of his truth and him , which was too far , Offers , as I do , in a sign of peace , His service and his counsel .
QUEEN KATHARINE : To betray me.-- My lords , I thank you both for your good wills ; Ye speak like honest men ; pray God , ye prove so ! But how to make ye suddenly an answer , In such a point of weight , so near mine honour , -- More near my life , I fear , --with my weak wit , And to such men of gravity and learning , In truth , I know not . I was set at work Among my maids : full little , God knows , looking Either for such men or such business . For her sake that I have been , --for I feel The last fit of my greatness , --good your graces , Let me have time and counsel for my cause : Alas , I am a woman , friendless , hopeless !
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Madam , you wrong the king 's love with these fears : Your hopes and friends are infinite .
QUEEN KATHARINE : In England But little for my profit : can you think , lords , That any Englishman dare give me counsel ? Or be a known friend , ' gainst his highness ' pleasure , Though he be grown so desperate to be honest , And live a subject ? Nay , forsooth , my friends , They that must weigh out my afflictions , They that my trust must grow to , live not here : They are , as all my other comforts , far hence In mine own country , lords .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : I would your grace Would leave your griefs , and take my counsel .
QUEEN KATHARINE : How , sir ?
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : Put your main cause into the king 's protection ; He 's loving and most gracious : ' twill be much Both for your honour better and your cause ; For if the trial of the law o 'ertake ye , You 'll part away disgraced .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : He tells you rightly .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Ye tell me what ye wish for both , --my ruin : Is this your Christian counsel ? out upon ye ! Heaven is above all yet ; there sits a judge That no king can corrupt .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : Your rage mistakes us .
QUEEN KATHARINE : The more shame for ye : holy men I thought ye , Upon my soul , two reverend cardinal virtues ; But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye : Mend ' em , for shame , my lords . Is this your comfort ? The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady , A woman lost among ye , laugh 'd at , scorn 'd ? I will not wish ye half my miseries ; I have more charity : but say , I warn 'd ye ; Take heed , for heaven 's sake , take heed , lest at once The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Madam , this is a mere distraction ; You turn the good we offer into envy .
