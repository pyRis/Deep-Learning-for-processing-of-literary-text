GRIFFITH : This cardinal , Though from an humble stock , undoubtedly Was fashion 'd to much honour from his cradle . He was a scholar , and a ripe and good one ; Exceeding wise , fair-spoken , and persuading : Lofty and sour to them that loved him not ; But to those men that sought him sweet as summer . And though he were unsatisfied in getting , Which was a sin , yet in bestowing , madam , He was most princely : ever witness for him Those twins Of learning that he raised in you , Ipswich and Oxford ! one of which fell with him , Unwilling to outlive the good that did it ; The other , though unfinish 'd , yet so famous , So excellent in art , and still so rising , That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue . His overthrow heap 'd happiness upon him ; For then , and not till then , he felt himself , And found the blessedness of being little : And , to add greater honours to his age Than man could give him , he died fearing God .
KATHARINE : After my death I wish no other herald , No other speaker of my living actions , To keep mine honour from corruption , But such an honest chronicler as Griffith . Whom I most hated living , thou hast made me , With thy religious truth and modesty , Now in his ashes honour : peace be with him ! Patience , be near me still ; and set me lower : I have not long to trouble thee . Good Griffith , Cause the musicians play me that sad note I named my knell , whilst I sit meditating On that celestial harmony I go to . Sad and solemn music
GRIFFITH : She is asleep : good wench , let 's sit down quiet , For fear we wake her : softly , gentle Patience . The vision . Enter , solemnly tripping one after another , six personages , clad in white robes , wearing on their heads garlands of bays , and golden vizards on their faces ; branches of bays or palm in their hands . They first congee unto her , then dance ; and , at certain changes , the first two hold a spare garland over her head ; at which the other four make reverent curtsies ; then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two , who observe the same order in their changes , and holding the garland over her head : which done , they deliver the same garland to the last two , who likewise observe the same order : at which , as it were by inspiration , she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing , and holdeth up her hands to heaven : and so in their dancing vanish , carrying the garland with them . The music continues
KATHARINE : Spirits of peace , where are ye ? are ye all gone , And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye ?
GRIFFITH : Madam , we are here .
KATHARINE : It is not you I call for : Saw ye none enter since I slept ?
GRIFFITH : None , madam .
KATHARINE : No ? Saw you not , even now , a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet ; whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me , like the sun ? They promised me eternal happiness ; And brought me garlands , Griffith , which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear : I shall , assuredly .
GRIFFITH : I am most joyful , madam , such good dreams Possess your fancy .
KATHARINE : Bid the music leave , They are harsh and heavy to me . Music ceases
PATIENCE : Do you note How much her grace is alter 'd on the sudden ? How long her face is drawn ? how pale she looks , And of an earthy cold ? Mark her eyes !
GRIFFITH : She is going , wench : pray , pray .
PATIENCE : Heaven comfort her ! Enter a Messenger
Messenger : An 't like your grace , --
KATHARINE : You are a saucy fellow : Deserve we no more reverence ?
GRIFFITH : You are to blame , Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness , To use so rude behavior ; go to , kneel .
Messenger : I humbly do entreat your highness ' pardon ; My haste made me unmannerly . There is staying A gentleman , sent from the king , to see you .
KATHARINE : Admit him entrance , Griffith : but this fellow Let me ne 'er see again . Re-enter GRIFFITH , with CAPUCIUS If my sight fail not , You should be lord ambassador from the emperor , My royal nephew , and your name Capucius .
CAPUCIUS : Madam , the same ; your servant .
KATHARINE : O , my lord , The times and titles now are alter 'd strangely With me since first you knew me . But , I pray you , What is your pleasure with me ?
CAPUCIUS : Noble lady , First mine own service to your grace ; the next , The king 's request that I would visit you ; Who grieves much for your weakness , and by me Sends you his princely commendations , And heartily entreats you take good comfort .
