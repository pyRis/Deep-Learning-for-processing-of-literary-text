First Gentleman : They that bear The cloth of honour over her , are four barons Of the Cinque-ports .
Second Gentleman : Those men are happy ; and so are all are near her . I take it , she that carries up the train Is that old noble lady , Duchess of Norfolk .
First Gentleman : It is ; and all the rest are countesses .
Second Gentleman : Their coronets say so . These are stars indeed ; And sometimes falling ones .
First Gentleman : No more of that . Exit procession , and then a great flourish of trumpets Enter a third Gentleman
First Gentleman : God save you , sir ! where have you been broiling ?
Third Gentleman : Among the crowd i ' the Abbey ; where a finger Could not be wedged in more : I am stifled With the mere rankness of their joy .
Second Gentleman : You saw The ceremony ?
Third Gentleman : That I did .
First Gentleman : How was it ?
Third Gentleman : Well worth the seeing .
Second Gentleman : Good sir , speak it to us .
Third Gentleman : As well as I am able . The rich stream Of lords and ladies , having brought the queen To a prepared place in the choir , fell off A distance from her ; while her grace sat down To rest awhile , some half an hour or so , In a rich chair of state , opposing freely The beauty of her person to the people . Believe me , sir , she is the goodliest woman That ever lay by man : which when the people Had the full view of , such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest , As loud , and to as many tunes : hats , cloaks-- Doublets , I think , --flew up ; and had their faces Been loose , this day they had been lost . Such joy I never saw before . Great-bellied women , That had not half a week to go , like rams In the old time of war , would shake the press , And make ' em reel before ' em . No man living Could say ' This is my wife ' there ; all were woven So strangely in one piece .
Second Gentleman : But , what follow 'd ?
Third Gentleman : At length her grace rose , and with modest paces Came to the altar ; where she kneel 'd , and saint-like Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray 'd devoutly . Then rose again and bow 'd her to the people : When by the Archbishop of Canterbury She had all the royal makings of a queen ; As holy oil , Edward Confessor 's crown , The rod , and bird of peace , and all such emblems Laid nobly on her : which perform 'd , the choir , With all the choicest music of the kingdom , Together sung ' Te Deum . ' So she parted , And with the same full state paced back again To York-place , where the feast is held .
First Gentleman : Sir , You must no more call it York-place , that 's past ; For , since the cardinal fell , that title 's lost : ' Tis now the king 's , and call 'd Whitehall .
Third Gentleman : I know it ; But ' tis so lately alter 'd , that the old name Is fresh about me .
Second Gentleman : What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the queen ?
Third Gentleman : Stokesly and Gardiner ; the one of Winchester , Newly preferr 'd from the king 's secretary , The other , London .
Second Gentleman : He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the archbishop 's , The virtuous Cranmer .
Third Gentleman : All the land knows that : However , yet there is no great breach ; when it comes , Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him .
Second Gentleman : Who may that be , I pray you ?
Third Gentleman : Thomas Cromwell ; A man in much esteem with the king , and truly A worthy friend . The king has made him master O ' the jewel house , And one , already , of the privy council .
