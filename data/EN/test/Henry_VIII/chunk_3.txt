KING HENRY VIII : My life itself , and the best heart of it , Thanks you for this great care : I stood i ' the level Of a full-charged confederacy , and give thanks To you that choked it . Let be call 'd before us That gentleman of Buckingham 's ; in person I 'll hear him his confessions justify ; And point by point the treasons of his master He shall again relate . A noise within , crying ' Room for the Queen ! ' Enter QUEEN KATHARINE , ushered by NORFOLK , and SUFFOLK : she kneels . KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state , takes her up , kisses and placeth her by him
QUEEN KATHARINE : Nay , we must longer kneel : I am a suitor .
KING HENRY VIII : Arise , and take place by us : half your suit Never name to us ; you have half our power : The other moiety , ere you ask , is given ; Repeat your will and take it .
QUEEN KATHARINE : Thank your majesty . That you would love yourself , and in that love Not unconsider 'd leave your honour , nor The dignity of your office , is the point Of my petition .
KING HENRY VIII : Lady mine , proceed .
QUEEN KATHARINE : I am solicited , not by a few , And those of true condition , that your subjects Are in great grievance : there have been commissions Sent down among ' em , which hath flaw 'd the heart Of all their loyalties : wherein , although , My good lord cardinal , they vent reproaches Most bitterly on you , as putter on Of these exactions , yet the king our master-- Whose honour heaven shield from soil ! --even he escapes not Language unmannerly , yea , such which breaks The sides of loyalty , and almost appears In loud rebellion .
NORFOLK : Not almost appears , It doth appear ; for , upon these taxations , The clothiers all , not able to maintain The many to them longing , have put off The spinsters , carders , fullers , weavers , who , Unfit for other life , compell 'd by hunger And lack of other means , in desperate manner Daring the event to the teeth , are all in uproar , And danger serves among then !
KING HENRY VIII : Taxation ! Wherein ? and what taxation ? My lord cardinal , You that are blamed for it alike with us , Know you of this taxation ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Please you , sir , I know but of a single part , in aught Pertains to the state ; and front but in that file Where others tell steps with me .
QUEEN KATHARINE : No , my lord , You know no more than others ; but you frame Things that are known alike ; which are not wholesome To those which would not know them , and yet must Perforce be their acquaintance . These exactions , Whereof my sovereign would have note , they are Most pestilent to the bearing ; and , to bear ' em , The back is sacrifice to the load . They say They are devised by you ; or else you suffer Too hard an exclamation .
KING HENRY VIII : Still exaction ! The nature of it ? in what kind , let 's know , Is this exaction ?
QUEEN KATHARINE : I am much too venturous In tempting of your patience ; but am bolden 'd Under your promised pardon . The subjects ' grief Comes through commissions , which compel from each The sixth part of his substance , to be levied Without delay ; and the pretence for this Is named , your wars in France : this makes bold mouths : Tongues spit their duties out , and cold hearts freeze Allegiance in them ; their curses now Live where their prayers did : and it 's come to pass , This tractable obedience is a slave To each incensed will . I would your highness Would give it quick consideration , for There is no primer business .
KING HENRY VIII : By my life , This is against our pleasure .
