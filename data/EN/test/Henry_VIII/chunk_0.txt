BUCKINGHAM : Good morrow , and well met . How have ye done Since last we saw in France ?
NORFOLK : I thank your grace , Healthful ; and ever since a fresh admirer Of what I saw there .
BUCKINGHAM : An untimely ague Stay 'd me a prisoner in my chamber when Those suns of glory , those two lights of men , Met in the vale of Andren .
NORFOLK : ' Twixt Guynes and Arde : I was then present , saw them salute on horseback ; Beheld them , when they lighted , how they clung In their embracement , as they grew together ; Which had they , what four throned ones could have weigh 'd Such a compounded one ?
BUCKINGHAM : All the whole time I was my chamber 's prisoner .
NORFOLK : Then you lost The view of earthly glory : men might say , Till this time pomp was single , but now married To one above itself . Each following day Became the next day 's master , till the last Made former wonders its . To-day the French , All clinquant , all in gold , like heathen gods , Shone down the English ; and , to-morrow , they Made Britain India : every man that stood Show 'd like a mine . Their dwarfish pages were As cherubins , all guilt : the madams too , Not used to toil , did almost sweat to bear The pride upon them , that their very labour Was to them as a painting : now this masque Was cried incomparable ; and the ensuing night Made it a fool and beggar . The two kings , Equal in lustre , were now best , now worst , As presence did present them ; him in eye , Still him in praise : and , being present both ' Twas said they saw but one ; and no discerner Durst wag his tongue in censure . When these suns-- For so they phrase ' em--by their heralds challenged The noble spirits to arms , they did perform Beyond thought 's compass ; that former fabulous story , Being now seen possible enough , got credit , That Bevis was believed .
BUCKINGHAM : O , you go far .
NORFOLK : As I belong to worship and affect In honour honesty , the tract of every thing Would by a good discourser lose some life , Which action 's self was tongue to . All was royal ; To the disposing of it nought rebell 'd . Order gave each thing view ; the office did Distinctly his full function .
BUCKINGHAM : Who did guide , I mean , who set the body and the limbs Of this great sport together , as you guess ?
NORFOLK : One , certes , that promises no element In such a business .
BUCKINGHAM : I pray you , who , my lord ?
NORFOLK : All this was order 'd by the good discretion Of the right reverend Cardinal of York .
BUCKINGHAM : The devil speed him ! no man 's pie is freed From his ambitious finger . What had he To do in these fierce vanities ? I wonder That such a keech can with his very bulk Take up the rays o ' the beneficial sun And keep it from the earth .
NORFOLK : Surely , sir , There 's in him stuff that puts him to these ends ; For , being not propp 'd by ancestry , whose grace Chalks successors their way , nor call 'd upon For high feats done to the crown ; neither allied For eminent assistants ; but , spider-like , Out of his self-drawing web , he gives us note , The force of his own merit makes his way A gift that heaven gives for him , which buys A place next to the king .
ABERGAVENNY : I cannot tell What heaven hath given him , --let some graver eye Pierce into that ; but I can see his pride Peep through each part of him : whence has he that , If not from hell ? the devil is a niggard , Or has given all before , and he begins A new hell in himself .
