To your highness ' hand I tender my commission ; by whose virtue , The court of Rome commanding , you , my lord Cardinal of York , are join 'd with me their servant In the unpartial judging of this business .
KING HENRY VIII : Two equal men . The queen shall be acquainted Forthwith for what you come . Where 's Gardiner ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : I know your majesty has always loved her So dear in heart , not to deny her that A woman of less place might ask by law : Scholars allow 'd freely to argue for her .
KING HENRY VIII : Ay , and the best she shall have ; and my favour To him that does best : God forbid else . Cardinal , Prithee , call Gardiner to me , my new secretary : I find him a fit fellow . Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY , with GARDINER
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Give me your hand much joy and favour to you ; You are the king 's now .
GARDINER : But to be commanded For ever by your grace , whose hand has raised me .
KING HENRY VIII : Come hither , Gardiner . Walks and whispers
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : My Lord of York , was not one Doctor Pace In this man 's place before him ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Yes , he was .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : Was he not held a learned man ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Yes , surely .
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : Believe me , there 's an ill opinion spread then Even of yourself , lord cardinal .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : How ! of me ?
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS : They will not stick to say you envied him , And fearing he would rise , he was so virtuous , Kept him a foreign man still ; which so grieved him , That he ran mad and died .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Heaven 's peace be with him ! That 's Christian care enough : for living murmurers There 's places of rebuke . He was a fool ; For he would needs be virtuous : that good fellow , If I command him , follows my appointment : I will have none so near else . Learn this , brother , We live not to be grip 'd by meaner persons .
KING HENRY VIII : Deliver this with modesty to the queen . Exit GARDINER The most convenient place that I can think of For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars ; There ye shall meet about this weighty business . My Wolsey , see it furnish 'd . O , my lord , Would it not grieve an able man to leave So sweet a bedfellow ? But , conscience , conscience ! O , ' tis a tender place ; and I must leave her . Enter ANNE and an Old Lady
ANNE : Not for that neither : here 's the pang that pinches : His highness having lived so long with her , and she So good a lady that no tongue could ever Pronounce dishonour of her ; by my life , She never knew harm-doing : O , now , after So many courses of the sun enthroned , Still growing in a majesty and pomp , the which To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than ' Tis sweet at first to acquire , --after this process , To give her the avaunt ! it is a pity Would move a monster .
Old Lady : Hearts of most hard temper Melt and lament for her .
ANNE : O , God 's will ! much better She ne 'er had known pomp : though 't be temporal , Yet , if that quarrel , fortune , do divorce It from the bearer , ' tis a sufferance panging As soul and body 's severing .
Old Lady : Alas , poor lady ! She 's a stranger now again .
ANNE : So much the more Must pity drop upon her . Verily , I swear , ' tis better to be lowly born , And range with humble livers in content , Than to be perk 'd up in a glistering grief , And wear a golden sorrow .
Old Lady : Our content Is our best having .
ANNE : By my troth and maidenhead , I would not be a queen .
