BUCKINGHAM : Sir , I am thankful to you ; and I 'll go along By your prescription : but this top-proud fellow , Whom from the flow of gall I name not but From sincere motions , by intelligence , And proofs as clear as founts in July when We see each grain of gravel , I do know To be corrupt and treasonous .
NORFOLK : Say not ' treasonous . ' 
BUCKINGHAM : To the king I 'll say 't ; and make my vouch as strong As shore of rock . Attend . This holy fox , Or wolf , or both , --for he is equal ravenous As he is subtle , and as prone to mischief As able to perform 't ; his mind and place Infecting one another , yea , reciprocally-- Only to show his pomp as well in France As here at home , suggests the king our master To this last costly treaty , the interview , That swallow 'd so much treasure , and like a glass Did break i ' the rinsing .
NORFOLK : Faith , and so it did .
BUCKINGHAM : Pray , give me favour , sir . This cunning cardinal The articles o ' the combination drew As himself pleased ; and they were ratified As he cried ' Thus let be ' : to as much end As give a crutch to the dead : but our count-cardinal Has done this , and ' tis well ; for worthy Wolsey , Who cannot err , he did it . Now this follows , -- Which , as I take it , is a kind of puppy To the old dam , treason , --Charles the emperor , Under pretence to see the queen his aunt-- For ' twas indeed his colour , but he came To whisper Wolsey , --here makes visitation : His fears were , that the interview betwixt England and France might , through their amity , Breed him some prejudice ; for from this league Peep 'd harms that menaced him : he privily Deals with our cardinal ; and , as I trow , -- Which I do well ; for I am sure the emperor Paid ere he promised ; whereby his suit was granted Ere it was ask 'd ; but when the way was made , And paved with gold , the emperor thus desired , That he would please to alter the king 's course , And break the foresaid peace . Let the king know , As soon he shall by me , that thus the cardinal Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases , And for his own advantage .
NORFOLK : I am sorry To hear this of him ; and could wish he were Something mistaken in 't .
BUCKINGHAM : No , not a syllable : I do pronounce him in that very shape He shall appear in proof . Enter BRANDON , a Sergeant-at-arms before him , and two or three of the Guard
BRANDON : Your office , sergeant ; execute it .
Sergeant : Sir , My lord the Duke of Buckingham , and Earl Of Hereford , Stafford , and Northampton , I Arrest thee of high treason , in the name Of our most sovereign king .
BUCKINGHAM : Lo , you , my lord , The net has fall 'n upon me ! I shall perish Under device and practise .
BRANDON : I am sorry To see you ta 'en from liberty , to look on The business present : ' tis his highness ' pleasure You shall to the Tower .
BUCKINGHAM : It will help me nothing To plead mine innocence ; for that dye is on me Which makes my whitest part black . The will of heaven Be done in this and all things ! I obey . O my Lord Abergavenny , fare you well !
BRANDON : Nay , he must bear you company . The king To ABERGAVENNY Is pleased you shall to the Tower , till you know How he determines further .
ABERGAVENNY : As the duke said , The will of heaven be done , and the king 's pleasure By me obey 'd !
BRANDON : Here is a warrant from The king to attach Lord Montacute ; and the bodies Of the duke 's confessor , John de la Car , One Gilbert Peck , his chancellor--
BUCKINGHAM : So , so ; These are the limbs o ' the plot : no more , I hope .
BRANDON : A monk o ' the Chartreux .
BUCKINGHAM : O , Nicholas Hopkins ?
BRANDON : He .
