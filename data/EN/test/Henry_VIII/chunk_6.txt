Chamberlain : I 'm glad ' tis there : now I would pray our monsieurs To think an English courtier may be wise , And never see the Louvre .
LOVELL : They must either , For so run the conditions , leave those remnants Of fool and feather that they got in France , With all their honourable point of ignorance Pertaining thereunto , as fights and fireworks , Abusing better men than they can be , Out of a foreign wisdom , renouncing clean The faith they have in tennis , and tall stockings , Short blister 'd breeches , and those types of travel , And understand again like honest men ; Or pack to their old playfellows : there , I take it , They may , ' cum privilegio , ' wear away The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh 'd at .
SANDS : ' Tis time to give ' em physic , their diseases Are grown so catching .
Chamberlain : What a loss our ladies Will have of these trim vanities !
LOVELL : Ay , marry , There will be woe indeed , lords : the sly whoresons Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies ; A French song and a fiddle has no fellow .
SANDS : The devil fiddle ' em ! I am glad they are going , For , sure , there 's no converting of ' em : now An honest country lord , as I am , beaten A long time out of play , may bring his plainsong And have an hour of hearing ; and , by 'r lady , Held current music too .
Chamberlain : Well said , Lord Sands ; Your colt 's tooth is not cast yet .
SANDS : No , my lord ; Nor shall not , while I have a stump .
Chamberlain : Sir Thomas , Whither were you a-going ?
LOVELL : To the cardinal 's : Your lordship is a guest too .
Chamberlain : O , ' tis true : This night he makes a supper , and a great one , To many lords and ladies ; there will be The beauty of this kingdom , I 'll assure you .
LOVELL : That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed , A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us ; His dews fall every where .
Chamberlain : No doubt he 's noble ; He had a black mouth that said other of him .
SANDS : He may , my lord ; has wherewithal : in him Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine : Men of his way should be most liberal ; They are set here for examples .
Chamberlain : True , they are so : But few now give so great ones . My barge stays ; Your lordship shall along . Come , good Sir Thomas , We shall be late else ; which I would not be , For I was spoke to , with Sir Henry Guildford This night to be comptrollers .
SANDS : I am your lordship 's . Hautboys . A small table under a state for CARDINAL WOLSEY , a longer table for the guests . Then enter ANNE and divers other Ladies and Gentlemen as guests , at one door ; at another door , enter GUILDFORD
GUILDFORD : Ladies , a general welcome from his grace Salutes ye all ; this night he dedicates To fair content and you : none here , he hopes , In all this noble bevy , has brought with her One care abroad ; he would have all as merry As , first , good company , good wine , good welcome , Can make good people . O , my lord , you 're tardy : Enter Chamberlain , SANDS , and LOVELL The very thought of this fair company Clapp 'd wings to me .
Chamberlain : You are young , Sir Harry Guildford .
SANDS : Sir Thomas Lovell , had the cardinal But half my lay thoughts in him , some of these Should find a running banquet ere they rested , I think would better please ' em : by my life , They are a sweet society of fair ones .
LOVELL : O , that your lordship were but now confessor To one or two of these !
SANDS : I would I were ; They should find easy penance .
LOVELL : Faith , how easy ?
SANDS : As easy as a down-bed would afford it .
