NORFOLK : Those articles , my lord , are in the king 's hand : But , thus much , they are foul ones .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : So much fairer And spotless shall mine innocence arise , When the king knows my truth .
SURREY : This cannot save you : I thank my memory , I yet remember Some of these articles ; and out they shall . Now , if you can blush and cry ' guilty , ' cardinal , You 'll show a little honesty .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Speak on , sir ; I dare your worst objections : if I blush , It is to see a nobleman want manners .
SURREY : I had rather want those than my head . Have at you ! First , that , without the king 's assent or knowledge , You wrought to be a legate ; by which power You maim 'd the jurisdiction of all bishops .
NORFOLK : Then , that in all you writ to Rome , or else To foreign princes , ' Ego et Rex meus ' Was still inscribed ; in which you brought the king To be your servant .
SUFFOLK : Then that , without the knowledge Either of king or council , when you went Ambassador to the emperor , you made bold To carry into Flanders the great seal .
SURREY : Item , you sent a large commission To Gregory de Cassado , to conclude , Without the king 's will or the state 's allowance , A league between his highness and Ferrara .
SUFFOLK : That , out of mere ambition , you have caused Your holy hat to be stamp 'd on the king 's coin .
SURREY : Then that you have sent innumerable substance-- By what means got , I leave to your own conscience-- To furnish Rome , and to prepare the ways You have for dignities ; to the mere undoing Of all the kingdom . Many more there are ; Which , since they are of you , and odious , I will not taint my mouth with .
Chamberlain : O my lord , Press not a falling man too far ! ' tis virtue : His faults lie open to the laws ; let them , Not you , correct him . My heart weeps to see him So little of his great self .
SURREY : I forgive him .
SUFFOLK : Lord cardinal , the king 's further pleasure is , Because all those things you have done of late , By your power legatine , within this kingdom , Fall into the compass of a praemunire , That therefore such a writ be sued against you ; To forfeit all your goods , lands , tenements , Chattels , and whatsoever , and to be Out of the king 's protection . This is my charge .
NORFOLK : And so we 'll leave you to your meditations How to live better . For your stubborn answer About the giving back the great seal to us , The king shall know it , and , no doubt , shall thank you . So fare you well , my little good lord cardinal .
