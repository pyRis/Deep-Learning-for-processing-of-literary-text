CRANMER : I am fearful : wherefore frowns he thus ? ' Tis his aspect of terror . All 's not well .
KING HENRY VIII : How now , my lord ! you desire to know Wherefore I sent for you .
CRANMER : It is my duty To attend your highness ' pleasure .
KING HENRY VIII : Pray you , arise , My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury . Come , you and I must walk a turn together ; I have news to tell you : come , come , give me your hand . Ah , my good lord , I grieve at what I speak , And am right sorry to repeat what follows I have , and most unwillingly , of late Heard many grievous , I do say , my lord , Grievous complaints of you ; which , being consider 'd , Have moved us and our council , that you shall This morning come before us ; where , I know , You cannot with such freedom purge yourself , But that , till further trial in those charges Which will require your answer , you must take Your patience to you , and be well contented To make your house our Tower : you a brother of us , It fits we thus proceed , or else no witness Would come against you .
CRANMER : I humbly thank your highness ; And am right glad to catch this good occasion Most throughly to be winnow 'd , where my chaff And corn shall fly asunder : for , I know , There 's none stands under more calumnious tongues Than I myself , poor man .
KING HENRY VIII : Stand up , good Canterbury : Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted In us , thy friend : give me thy hand , stand up : Prithee , let 's walk . Now , by my holidame . What manner of man are you ? My lord , I look 'd You would have given me your petition , that I should have ta 'en some pains to bring together Yourself and your accusers ; and to have heard you , Without indurance , further .
CRANMER : Most dread liege , The good I stand on is my truth and honesty : If they shall fail , I , with mine enemies , Will triumph o 'er my person ; which I weigh not , Being of those virtues vacant . I fear nothing What can be said against me .
KING HENRY VIII : Know you not How your state stands i ' the world , with the whole world ? Your enemies are many , and not small ; their practises Must bear the same proportion ; and not ever The justice and the truth o ' the question carries The due o ' the verdict with it : at what ease Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt To swear against you ? such things have been done . You are potently opposed ; and with a malice Of as great size . Ween you of better luck , I mean , in perjured witness , than your master , Whose minister you are , whiles here he lived Upon this naughty earth ? Go to , go to ; You take a precipice for no leap of danger , And woo your own destruction .
CRANMER : God and your majesty Protect mine innocence , or I fall into The trap is laid for me !
KING HENRY VIII : Be of good cheer ; They shall no more prevail than we give way to . Keep comfort to you ; and this morning see You do appear before them : if they shall chance , In charging you with matters , to commit you , The best persuasions to the contrary Fail not to use , and with what vehemency The occasion shall instruct you : if entreaties Will render you no remedy , this ring Deliver them , and your appeal to us There make before them . Look , the good man weeps ! He 's honest , on mine honour . God 's blest mother ! I swear he is true--hearted ; and a soul None better in my kingdom . Get you gone , And do as I have bid you . Exit CRANMER He has strangled His language in his tears . Enter Old Lady , LOVELL following
