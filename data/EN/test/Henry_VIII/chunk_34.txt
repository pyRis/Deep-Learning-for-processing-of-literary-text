NORFOLK : Who waits there ?
Keeper : Without , my noble lords ?
GARDINER : Yes .
Keeper : My lord archbishop ; And has done half an hour , to know your pleasures .
Chancellor : Let him come in .
Keeper : Your grace may enter now . CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table
Chancellor : My good lord archbishop , I 'm very sorry To sit here at this present , and behold That chair stand empty : but we all are men , In our own natures frail , and capable Of our flesh ; few are angels : out of which frailty And want of wisdom , you , that best should teach us , Have misdemean 'd yourself , and not a little , Toward the king first , then his laws , in filling The whole realm , by your teaching and your chaplains , For so we are inform 'd , with new opinions , Divers and dangerous ; which are heresies , And , not reform 'd , may prove pernicious .
GARDINER : Which reformation must be sudden too , My noble lords ; for those that tame wild horses Pace ' em not in their hands to make ' em gentle , But stop their mouths with stubborn bits , and spur ' em , Till they obey the manage . If we suffer , Out of our easiness and childish pity To one man 's honour , this contagious sickness , Farewell all physic : and what follows then ? Commotions , uproars , with a general taint Of the whole state : as , of late days , our neighbours , The upper Germany , can dearly witness , Yet freshly pitied in our memories .
CRANMER : My good lords , hitherto , in all the progress Both of my life and office , I have labour 'd , And with no little study , that my teaching And the strong course of my authority Might go one way , and safely ; and the end Was ever , to do well : nor is there living , I speak it with a single heart , my lords , A man that more detests , more stirs against , Both in his private conscience and his place , Defacers of a public peace , than I do . Pray heaven , the king may never find a heart With less allegiance in it ! Men that make Envy and crooked malice nourishment Dare bite the best . I do beseech your lordships , That , in this case of justice , my accusers , Be what they will , may stand forth face to face , And freely urge against me .
SUFFOLK : Nay , my lord , That cannot be : you are a counsellor , And , by that virtue , no man dare accuse you .
GARDINER : My lord , because we have business of more moment , We will be short with you . ' Tis his highness ' pleasure , And our consent , for better trial of you , From hence you be committed to the Tower ; Where , being but a private man again , You shall know many dare accuse you boldly , More than , I fear , you are provided for .
CRANMER : Ah , my good Lord of Winchester , I thank you ; You are always my good friend ; if your will pass , I shall both find your lordship judge and juror , You are so merciful : I see your end ; ' Tis my undoing : love and meekness , lord , Become a churchman better than ambition : Win straying souls with modesty again , Cast none away . That I shall clear myself , Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience , I make as little doubt , as you do conscience In doing daily wrongs . I could say more , But reverence to your calling makes me modest .
GARDINER : My lord , my lord , you are a sectary , That 's the plain truth : your painted gloss discovers , To men that understand you , words and weakness .
CROMWELL : My Lord of Winchester , you are a little , By your good favour , too sharp ; men so noble , However faulty , yet should find respect For what they have been : ' tis a cruelty To load a falling man .
