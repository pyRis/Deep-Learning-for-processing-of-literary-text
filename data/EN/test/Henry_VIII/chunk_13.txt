Old Lady : Beshrew me , I would , And venture maidenhead for 't ; and so would you , For all this spice of your hypocrisy : You , that have so fair parts of woman on you , Have too a woman 's heart ; which ever yet Affected eminence , wealth , sovereignty ; Which , to say sooth , are blessings ; and which gifts , Saving your mincing , the capacity Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive , If you might please to stretch it .
ANNE : Nay , good troth .
Old Lady : Yes , troth , and troth ; you would not be a queen ?
ANNE : No , not for all the riches under heaven . Old Lady : ' Tis strange : a three-pence bow 'd would hire me , Old as I am , to queen it : but , I pray you , What think you of a duchess ? have you limbs To bear that load of title ?
ANNE : No , in truth .
Old Lady : Then you are weakly made : pluck off a little ; I would not be a young count in your way , For more than blushing comes to : if your back Cannot vouchsafe this burthen , ' tis too weak Ever to get a boy .
ANNE : How you do talk ! I swear again , I would not be a queen For all the world .
Old Lady : In faith , for little England You 'ld venture an emballing : I myself Would for Carnarvonshire , although there long 'd No more to the crown but that . Lo , who comes here ? Enter Chamberlain
Chamberlain : Good morrow , ladies . What were 't worth to know The secret of your conference ?
ANNE : My good lord , Not your demand ; it values not your asking : Our mistress ' sorrows we were pitying .
Chamberlain : It was a gentle business , and becoming The action of good women : there is hope All will be well .
ANNE : Now , I pray God , amen !
Chamberlain : You bear a gentle mind , and heavenly blessings Follow such creatures . That you may , fair lady , Perceive I speak sincerely , and high note 's Ta 'en of your many virtues , the king 's majesty Commends his good opinion of you , and Does purpose honour to you no less flowing Than Marchioness of Pembroke : to which title A thousand pound a year , annual support , Out of his grace he adds .
ANNE : I do not know What kind of my obedience I should tender ; More than my all is nothing : nor my prayers Are not words duly hallow 'd , nor my wishes More worth than empty vanities ; yet prayers and wishes Are all I can return . Beseech your lordship , Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience , As from a blushing handmaid , to his highness ; Whose health and royalty I pray for .
Chamberlain : Lady , I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit The king hath of you . Aside I have perused her well ; Beauty and honour in her are so mingled That they have caught the king : and who knows yet But from this lady may proceed a gem To lighten all this isle ? I 'll to the king , And say I spoke with you . Exit Chamberlain
ANNE : My honour 'd lord .
Old Lady : Why , this it is ; see , see ! I have been begging sixteen years in court , Am yet a courtier beggarly , nor could Come pat betwixt too early and too late For any suit of pounds ; and you , O fate ! A very fresh-fish here--fie , fie , fie upon This compell 'd fortune ! --have your mouth fill 'd up Before you open it .
ANNE : This is strange to me .
Old Lady : How tastes it ? is it bitter ? forty pence , no . There was a lady once , ' tis an old story , That would not be a queen , that would she not , For all the mud in Egypt : have you heard it ?
ANNE : Come , you are pleasant .
Old Lady : With your theme , I could O 'ermount the lark . The Marchioness of Pembroke ! A thousand pounds a year for pure respect ! No other obligation ! By my life , That promises moe thousands : honour 's train Is longer than his foreskirt . By this time I know your back will bear a duchess : say , Are you not stronger than you were ?
