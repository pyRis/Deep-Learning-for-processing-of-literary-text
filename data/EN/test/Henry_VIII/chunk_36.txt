Chancellor : Thus far , My most dread sovereign , may it like your grace To let my tongue excuse all . What was purposed Concerning his imprisonment , was rather , If there be faith in men , meant for his trial , And fair purgation to the world , than malice , I 'm sure , in me .
KING HENRY VIII : Well , well , my lords , respect him ; Take him , and use him well , he 's worthy of it . I will say thus much for him , if a prince May be beholding to a subject , I Am , for his love and service , so to him . Make me no more ado , but all embrace him : Be friends , for shame , my lords ! My Lord of Canterbury , I have a suit which you must not deny me ; That is , a fair young maid that yet wants baptism , You must be godfather , and answer for her .
CRANMER : The greatest monarch now alive may glory In such an honour : how may I deserve it That am a poor and humble subject to you ?
KING HENRY VIII : Come , come , my lord , you 'ld spare your spoons : you shall have two noble partners with you ; the old Duchess of Norfolk , and Lady Marquess Dorset : will these please you ? Once more , my Lord of Winchester , I charge you , Embrace and love this man .
GARDINER : With a true heart And brother-love I do it .
CRANMER : And let heaven Witness , how dear I hold this confirmation .
KING HENRY VIII : Good man , those joyful tears show thy true heart : The common voice , I see , is verified Of thee , which says thus , ' Do my Lord of Canterbury A shrewd turn , and he is your friend for ever . ' Come , lords , we trifle time away ; I long To have this young one made a Christian . As I have made ye one , lords , one remain ; So I grow stronger , you more honour gain . Noise and tumult within . Enter Porter and his Man
Porter : You 'll leave your noise anon , ye rascals : do you take the court for Paris-garden ? ye rude slaves , leave your gaping . Within Good master porter , I belong to the larder .
Porter : Belong to the gallows , and be hanged , ye rogue ! is this a place to roar in ? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves , and strong ones : these are but switches to ' em . I 'll scratch your heads : you must be seeing christenings ? do you look for ale and cakes here , you rude rascals ?
Man : Pray , sir , be patient : ' tis as much impossible-- Unless we sweep ' em from the door with cannons-- To scatter ' em , as ' tis to make ' em sleep On May-day morning ; which will never be : We may as well push against Powle 's , as stir em .
Porter : How got they in , and be hang 'd ?
Man : Alas , I know not ; how gets the tide in ? As much as one sound cudgel of four foot-- You see the poor remainder--could distribute , I made no spare , sir .
Porter : You did nothing , sir .
Man : I am not Samson , nor Sir Guy , nor Colbrand , To mow ' em down before me : but if I spared any That had a head to hit , either young or old , He or she , cuckold or cuckold-maker , Let me ne 'er hope to see a chine again And that I would not for a cow , God save her ! Within Do you hear , master porter ?
Porter : I shall be with you presently , good master puppy . Keep the door close , sirrah .
Man : What would you have me do ?
