CARDINAL WOLSEY : Is he ready To come abroad ?
CROMWELL : I think , by this he is .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Leave me awhile . Exit CROMWELL Aside It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon , The French king 's sister : he shall marry her . Anne Bullen ! No ; I 'll no Anne Bullens for him : There 's more in 't than fair visage . Bullen ! No , we 'll no Bullens . Speedily I wish To hear from Rome . The Marchioness of Pembroke !
NORFOLK : He 's discontented .
SUFFOLK : May be , he hears the king Does whet his anger to him .
SURREY : Sharp enough , Lord , for thy justice !
CARDINAL WOLSEY : The late queen 's gentlewoman , a knight 's daughter , To be her mistress ' mistress ! the queen 's queen ! This candle burns not clear : ' tis I must snuff it ; Then out it goes . What though I know her virtuous And well deserving ? yet I know her for A spleeny Lutheran ; and not wholesome to Our cause , that she should lie i ' the bosom of Our hard-ruled king . Again , there is sprung up An heretic , an arch one , Cranmer ; one Hath crawl 'd into the favour of the king , And is his oracle .
NORFOLK : He is vex 'd at something .
SURREY : I would ' twere something that would fret the string , The master-cord on 's heart ! Enter KING HENRY VIII , reading of a schedule , and LOVELL
SUFFOLK : The king , the king !
KING HENRY VIII : What piles of wealth hath he accumulated To his own portion ! and what expense by the hour Seems to flow from him ! How , i ' the name of thrift , Does he rake this together ! Now , my lords , Saw you the cardinal ?
NORFOLK : My lord , we have Stood here observing him : some strange commotion Is in his brain : he bites his lip , and starts ; Stops on a sudden , looks upon the ground , Then lays his finger on his temple , straight Springs out into fast gait ; then stops again , Strikes his breast hard , and anon he casts His eye against the moon : in most strange postures We have seen him set himself .
KING HENRY VIII : It may well be ; There is a mutiny in 's mind . This morning Papers of state he sent me to peruse , As I required : and wot you what I found There , --on my conscience , put unwittingly ? Forsooth , an inventory , thus importing ; The several parcels of his plate , his treasure , Rich stuffs , and ornaments of household ; which I find at such proud rate , that it out-speaks Possession of a subject .
NORFOLK : It 's heaven 's will : Some spirit put this paper in the packet , To bless your eye withal .
KING HENRY VIII : If we did think His contemplation were above the earth , And fix 'd on spiritual object , he should still Dwell in his musings : but I am afraid His thinkings are below the moon , not worth His serious considering . King HENRY VIII takes his seat ; whispers LOVELL , who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Heaven forgive me ! Ever God bless your highness !
KING HENRY VIII : Good my lord , You are full of heavenly stuff , and bear the inventory Of your best graces in your mind ; the which You were now running o 'er : you have scarce time To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span To keep your earthly audit : sure , in that I deem you an ill husband , and am glad To have you therein my companion .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Sir , For holy offices I have a time ; a time To think upon the part of business which I bear i ' the state ; and nature does require Her times of preservation , which perforce I , her frail son , amongst my brethren mortal , Must give my tendence to .
KING HENRY VIII : You have said well .
