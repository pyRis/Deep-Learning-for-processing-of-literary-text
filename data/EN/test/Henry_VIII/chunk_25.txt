CARDINAL WOLSEY : So farewell to the little good you bear me . Farewell ! a long farewell , to all my greatness ! This is the state of man : to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hopes ; to-morrow blossoms , And bears his blushing honours thick upon him ; The third day comes a frost , a killing frost , And , when he thinks , good easy man , full surely His greatness is a-ripening , nips his root , And then he falls , as I do . I have ventured , Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders , This many summers in a sea of glory , But far beyond my depth : my high-blown pride At length broke under me and now has left me , Weary and old with service , to the mercy Of a rude stream , that must for ever hide me . Vain pomp and glory of this world , I hate ye : I feel my heart new open 'd . O , how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes ' favours ! There is , betwixt that smile we would aspire to , That sweet aspect of princes , and their ruin , More pangs and fears than wars or women have : And when he falls , he falls like Lucifer , Never to hope again . Enter CROMWELL , and stands amazed Why , how now , Cromwell !
CROMWELL : I have no power to speak , sir .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : What , amazed At my misfortunes ? can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline ? Nay , an you weep , I am fall 'n indeed .
CROMWELL : How does your grace ?
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Why , well ; Never so truly happy , my good Cromwell . I know myself now ; and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities , A still and quiet conscience . The king has cured me , I humbly thank his grace ; and from these shoulders , These ruin 'd pillars , out of pity , taken A load would sink a navy , too much honour : O , ' tis a burthen , Cromwell , ' tis a burthen Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven !
CROMWELL : I am glad your grace has made that right use of it .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : I hope I have : I am able now , methinks , Out of a fortitude of soul I feel , To endure more miseries and greater far Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer . What news abroad ?
CROMWELL : The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the king .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : God bless him !
CROMWELL : The next is , that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord chancellor in your place .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : That 's somewhat sudden : But he 's a learned man . May he continue Long in his highness ' favour , and do justice For truth 's sake and his conscience ; that his bones , When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings , May have a tomb of orphans ' tears wept on em ! What more ?
CROMWELL : That Cranmer is return 'd with welcome , Install 'd lord archbishop of Canterbury .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : That 's news indeed .
CROMWELL : Last , that the Lady Anne , Whom the king hath in secrecy long married , This day was view 'd in open as his queen , Going to chapel ; and the voice is now Only about her coronation .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : There was the weight that pull 'd me down . O Cromwell , The king has gone beyond me : all my glories In that one woman I have lost for ever : No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours , Or gild again the noble troops that waited Upon my smiles . Go , get thee from me , Cromwell ; I am a poor fall 'n man , unworthy now To be thy lord and master : seek the king ; That sun , I pray , may never set ! I have told him What and how true thou art : he will advance thee ; Some little memory of me will stir him-- I know his noble nature--not to let Thy hopeful service perish too : good Cromwell , Neglect him not ; make use now , and provide For thine own future safety .
CROMWELL : O my lord , Must I , then , leave you ? must I needs forego So good , so noble and so true a master ? Bear witness , all that have not hearts of iron , With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord . The king shall have my service : but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours .
