Surveyor : Not long before your highness sped to France , The duke being at the Rose , within the parish Saint Lawrence Poultney , did of me demand What was the speech among the Londoners Concerning the French journey : I replied , Men fear 'd the French would prove perfidious , To the king 's danger . Presently the duke Said , ' twas the fear , indeed ; and that he doubted ' Twould prove the verity of certain words Spoke by a holy monk ; ' that oft , ' says he , ' Hath sent to me , wishing me to permit John de la Car , my chaplain , a choice hour To hear from him a matter of some moment : Whom after under the confession 's seal He solemnly had sworn , that what he spoke My chaplain to no creature living , but To me , should utter , with demure confidence This pausingly ensued : neither the king nor 's heirs , Tell you the duke , shall prosper : bid him strive To gain the love o ' the commonalty : the duke Shall govern England . ' 
QUEEN KATHARINE : If I know you well , You were the duke 's surveyor , and lost your office On the complaint o ' the tenants : take good heed You charge not in your spleen a noble person And spoil your nobler soul : I say , take heed ; Yes , heartily beseech you .
KING HENRY VIII : Let him on . Go forward .
Surveyor : On my soul , I 'll speak but truth . I told my lord the duke , by the devil 's illusions The monk might be deceived ; and that ' twas dangerous for him To ruminate on this so far , until It forged him some design , which , being believed , It was much like to do : he answer 'd , ' Tush , It can do me no damage ; ' adding further , That , had the king in his last sickness fail 'd , The cardinal 's and Sir Thomas Lovell 's heads Should have gone off .
KING HENRY VIII : Ha ! what , so rank ? Ah ha ! There 's mischief in this man : canst thou say further ?
Surveyor : I can , my liege .
KING HENRY VIII : Proceed .
Surveyor : Being at Greenwich , After your highness had reproved the duke About Sir William Blomer , --
KING HENRY VIII : I remember Of such a time : being my sworn servant , The duke retain 'd him his . But on ; what hence ?
Surveyor : ' If , ' quoth he , ' I for this had been committed , As , to the Tower , I thought , I would have play 'd The part my father meant to act upon The usurper Richard ; who , being at Salisbury , Made suit to come in 's presence ; which if granted , As he made semblance of his duty , would Have put his knife to him . ' 
KING HENRY VIII : A giant traitor !
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Now , madam , may his highness live in freedom , and this man out of prison ?
QUEEN KATHARINE : God mend all !
KING HENRY VIII : There 's something more would out of thee ; what say 'st ?
Surveyor : After ' the duke his father , ' with ' the knife , ' He stretch 'd him , and , with one hand on his dagger , Another spread on 's breast , mounting his eyes He did discharge a horrible oath ; whose tenor Was , --were he evil used , he would outgo His father by as much as a performance Does an irresolute purpose .
KING HENRY VIII : There 's his period , To sheathe his knife in us . He is attach 'd ; Call him to present trial : if he may Find mercy in the law , ' tis his : if none , Let him not seek ' t of us : by day and night , He 's traitor to the height . Enter Chamberlain and SANDS
Chamberlain : Is 't possible the spells of France should juggle Men into such strange mysteries ?
SANDS : New customs , Though they be never so ridiculous , Nay , let ' em be unmanly , yet are follow 'd .
Chamberlain : As far as I see , all the good our English Have got by the late voyage is but merely A fit or two o ' the face ; but they are shrewd ones ; For when they hold ' em , you would swear directly Their very noses had been counsellors To Pepin or Clotharius , they keep state so .
SANDS : They have all new legs , and lame ones : one would take it , That never saw ' em pace before , the spavin Or springhalt reign 'd among ' em .
Chamberlain : Death ! my lord , Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too , That , sure , they 've worn out Christendom . Enter LOVELL How now ! What news , Sir Thomas Lovell ?
LOVELL : Faith , my lord , I hear of none , but the new proclamation That 's clapp 'd upon the court-gate .
Chamberlain : What is 't for ?
LOVELL : The reformation of our travell 'd gallants , That fill the court with quarrels , talk , and tailors .
