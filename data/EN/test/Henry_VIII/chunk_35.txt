GARDINER : Good master secretary , I cry your honour mercy ; you may , worst Of all this table , say so .
CROMWELL : Why , my lord ?
GARDINER : Do not I know you for a favourer Of this new sect ? ye are not sound .
CROMWELL : Not sound ?
GARDINER : Not sound , I say .
CROMWELL : Would you were half so honest ! Men 's prayers then would seek you , not their fears .
GARDINER : I shall remember this bold language .
CROMWELL : Do . Remember your bold life too .
Chancellor : This is too much ; Forbear , for shame , my lords .
GARDINER : I have done .
CROMWELL : And I.
Chancellor : Then thus for you , my lord : it stands agreed , I take it , by all voices , that forthwith You be convey 'd to the Tower a prisoner ; There to remain till the king 's further pleasure Be known unto us : are you all agreed , lords ?
All : We are .
CRANMER : Is there no other way of mercy , But I must needs to the Tower , my lords ?
GARDINER : What other Would you expect ? you are strangely troublesome . Let some o ' the guard be ready there . Enter Guard
CRANMER : For me ? Must I go like a traitor thither ?
GARDINER : Receive him , And see him safe i ' the Tower .
CRANMER : Stay , good my lords , I have a little yet to say . Look there , my lords ; By virtue of that ring , I take my cause Out of the gripes of cruel men , and give it To a most noble judge , the king my master .
Chamberlain : This is the king 's ring .
SURREY : ' Tis no counterfeit .
SUFFOLK : ' Tis the right ring , by heaven : I told ye all , When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling , ' Twould fall upon ourselves .
NORFOLK : Do you think , my lords , The king will suffer but the little finger Of this man to be vex 'd ?
Chancellor : ' Tis now too certain : How much more is his life in value with him ? Would I were fairly out on 't !
CROMWELL : My mind gave me , In seeking tales and informations Against this man , whose honesty the devil And his disciples only envy at , Ye blew the fire that burns ye : now have at ye ! Enter KING , frowning on them ; takes his seat
GARDINER : Dread sovereign , how much are we bound to heaven In daily thanks , that gave us such a prince ; Not only good and wise , but most religious : One that , in all obedience , makes the church The chief aim of his honour ; and , to strengthen That holy duty , out of dear respect , His royal self in judgment comes to hear The cause betwixt her and this great offender .
KING HENRY VIII : You were ever good at sudden commendations , Bishop of Winchester . But know , I come not To hear such flattery now , and in my presence ; They are too thin and bare to hide offences . To me you cannot reach , you play the spaniel , And think with wagging of your tongue to win me ; But , whatsoe 'er thou takest me for , I 'm sure Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody . To CRANMER Good man , sit down . Now let me see the proudest He , that dares most , but wag his finger at thee : By all that 's holy , he had better starve Than but once think this place becomes thee not .
SURREY : May it please your grace , --
