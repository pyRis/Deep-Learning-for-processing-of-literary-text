Second Gentleman : I do not think he fears death .
First Gentleman : Sure , he does not : He never was so womanish ; the cause He may a little grieve at .
Second Gentleman : Certainly The cardinal is the end of this .
First Gentleman : ' Tis likely , By all conjectures : first , Kildare 's attainder , Then deputy of Ireland ; who removed , Earl Surrey was sent thither , and in haste too , Lest he should help his father .
Second Gentleman : That trick of state Was a deep envious one .
First Gentleman : At his return No doubt he will requite it . This is noted , And generally , whoever the king favours , The cardinal instantly will find employment , And far enough from court too .
Second Gentleman : All the commons Hate him perniciously , and , o ' my conscience , Wish him ten fathom deep : this duke as much They love and dote on ; call him bounteous Buckingham , The mirror of all courtesy ; --
First Gentleman : Stay there , sir , And see the noble ruin 'd man you speak of . Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment ; tip-staves before him ; the axe with the edge towards him ; halberds on each side : accompanied with LOVELL , VAUX , SANDS , and common people
Second Gentleman : Let 's stand close , and behold him .
BUCKINGHAM : All good people , You that thus far have come to pity me , Hear what I say , and then go home and lose me . I have this day received a traitor 's judgment , And by that name must die : yet , heaven bear witness , And if I have a co nscience , let it sink me , Even as the axe falls , if I be not faithful ! The law I bear no malice for my death ; ' T has done , upon the premises , but justice : But those that sought it I could wish more Christians : Be what they will , I heartily forgive ' em : Yet let ' em look they glory not in mischief , Nor build their evils on the graves of great men ; For then my guiltless blood must cry against ' em . For further life in this world I ne 'er hope , Nor will I sue , although the king have mercies More than I dare make faults . You few that loved me , And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham , His noble friends and fellows , whom to leave Is only bitter to him , only dying , Go with me , like good angels , to my end ; And , as the long divorce of steel falls on me , Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice , And lift my soul to heaven . Lead on , o ' God 's name .
LOVELL : I do beseech your grace , for charity , If ever any malice in your heart Were hid against me , now to forgive me frankly .
BUCKINGHAM : Sir Thomas Lovell , I as free forgive you As I would be forgiven : I forgive all ; There cannot be those numberless offences ' Gainst me , that I cannot take peace with : no black envy Shall mark my grave . Commend me to his grace ; And if he speak of Buckingham , pray , tell him You met him half in heaven : my vows and prayers Yet are the king 's ; and , till my soul forsake , Shall cry for blessings on him : may he live Longer than I have time to tell his years ! Ever beloved and loving may his rule be ! And when old time shall lead him to his end , Goodness and he fill up one monument !
LOVELL : To the water side I must conduct your grace ; Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux , Who undertakes you to your end .
VAUX : Prepare there , The duke is coming : see the barge be ready ; And fit it with such furniture as suits The greatness of his person .
