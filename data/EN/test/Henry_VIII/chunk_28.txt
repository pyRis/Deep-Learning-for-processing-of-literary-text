Third Gentleman : Yes , without all doubt . Come , gentlemen , ye shall go my way , which Is to the court , and there ye shall be my guests : Something I can command . As I walk thither , I 'll tell ye more .
Both : You may command us , sir . Enter KATHARINE , Dowager , sick ; led between GRIFFITH , her gentleman usher , and PATIENCE , her woman
GRIFFITH : How does your grace ?
KATHARINE : O Griffith , sick to death ! My legs , like loaden branches , bow to the earth , Willing to leave their burthen . Reach a chair : So ; now , methinks , I feel a little ease . Didst thou not tell me , Griffith , as thou led 'st me , That the great child of honour , Cardinal Wolsey , Was dead ?
GRIFFITH : Yes , madam ; but I think your grace , Out of the pain you suffer 'd , gave no ear to 't .
KATHARINE : Prithee , good Griffith , tell me how he died : If well , he stepp 'd before me , happily For my example .
GRIFFITH : Well , the voice goes , madam : For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York , and brought him forward , As a man sorely tainted , to his answer , He fell sick suddenly , and grew so ill He could not sit his mule .
KATHARINE : Alas , poor man !
GRIFFITH : At last , with easy roads , he came to Leicester , Lodged in the abbey ; where the reverend abbot , With all his covent , honourably received him ; To whom he gave these words , ' O , father abbot , An old man , broken with the storms of state , Is come to lay his weary bones among ye ; Give him a little earth for charity ! ' So went to bed ; where eagerly his sickness Pursued him still : and , three nights after this , About the hour of eight , which he himself Foretold should be his last , full of repentance , Continual meditations , tears , and sorrows , He gave his honours to the world again , His blessed part to heaven , and slept in peace .
KATHARINE : So may he rest ; his faults lie gently on him ! Yet thus far , Griffith , give me leave to speak him , And yet with charity . He was a man Of an unbounded stomach , ever ranking Himself with princes ; one that , by suggestion , Tied all the kingdom : simony was fair-play ; His own opinion was his law : i ' the presence He would say untruths ; and be ever double Both in his words and meaning : he was never , But where he meant to ruin , pitiful : His promises were , as he then was , mighty ; But his performance , as he is now , nothing : Of his own body he was ill , and gave The clergy in example .
GRIFFITH : Noble madam , Men 's evil manners live in brass ; their virtues We write in water . May it please your highness To hear me speak his good now ?
KATHARINE : Yes , good Griffith ; I were malicious else .
