NORFOLK : How holily he works in all his business ! And with what zeal ! for , now he has crack 'd the league Between us and the emperor , the queen 's great nephew , He dives into the king 's soul , and there scatters Dangers , doubts , wringing of the conscience , Fears , and despairs ; and all these for his marriage : And out of all these to restore the king , He counsels a divorce ; a loss of her That , like a jewel , has hung twenty years About his neck , yet never lost her lustre ; Of her that loves him with that excellence That angels love good men with ; even of her That , when the greatest stroke of fortune falls , Will bless the king : and is not this course pious ?
Chamberlain : Heaven keep me from such counsel ! ' Tis most true These news are every where ; every tongue speaks ' em , And every true heart weeps for 't : all that dare Look into these affairs see this main end , The French king 's sister . Heaven will one day open The king 's eyes , that so long have slept upon This bold bad man .
SUFFOLK : And free us from his slavery .
NORFOLK : We had need pray , And heartily , for our deliverance ; Or this imperious man will work us all From princes into pages : all men 's honours Lie like one lump before him , to be fashion 'd Into what pitch he please .
SUFFOLK : For me , my lords , I love him not , nor fear him ; there 's my creed : As I am made without him , so I 'll stand , If the king please ; his curses and his blessings Touch me alike , they 're breath I not believe in . I knew him , and I know him ; so I leave him To him that made him proud , the pope .
NORFOLK : Let 's in ; And with some other business put the king From these sad thoughts , that work too much upon him : My lord , you 'll bear us company ?
Chamberlain : Excuse me ; The king has sent me otherwhere : besides , You 'll find a most unfit time to disturb him : Health to your lordships .
NORFOLK : Thanks , my good lord chamberlain . Exit Chamberlain ; and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain , and sits reading pensively
SUFFOLK : How sad he looks ! sure , he is much afflicted .
KING HENRY VIII : Who 's there , ha ?
NORFOLK : Pray God he be not angry .
KING HENRY VIII : Who 's there , I say ? How dare you thrust yourselves Into my private meditations ? Who am I ? ha ?
NORFOLK : A gracious king that pardons all offences Malice ne 'er meant : our breach of duty this way Is business of estate ; in which we come To know your royal pleasure .
KING HENRY VIII : Ye are too bold : Go to ; I 'll make ye know your times of business : Is this an hour for temporal affairs , ha ? Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS , with a commission Who 's there ? my good lord cardinal ? O my Wolsey , The quiet of my wounded conscience ; Thou art a cure fit for a king . To CARDINAL CAMPEIUS You 're welcome , Most learned reverend sir , into our kingdom : Use us and it . To CARDINAL WOLSEY My good lord , have great care I be not found a talker .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Sir , you cannot . I would your grace would give us but an hour Of private conference .
KING HENRY VIII : We are busy ; go .
NORFOLK : This priest has no pride in him ?
SUFFOLK : Not to speak of : I would not be so sick though for his place : But this cannot continue .
NORFOLK : If it do , I 'll venture one have-at-him .
SUFFOLK : I another .
CARDINAL WOLSEY : Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom Above all princes , in committing freely Your scruple to the voice of Christendom : Who can be angry now ? what envy reach you ? The Spaniard , tied blood and favour to her , Must now confess , if they have any goodness , The trial just and noble . All the clerks , I mean the learned ones , in Christian kingdoms Have their free voices : Rome , the nurse of judgment , Invited by your noble self , hath sent One general tongue unto us , this good man , This just and learned priest , Cardinal Campeius ; Whom once more I present unto your highness .
KING HENRY VIII : And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome , And thank the holy conclave for their loves : They have sent me such a man I would have wish 'd for .
