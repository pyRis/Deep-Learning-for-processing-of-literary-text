JAQUES : I have neither the scholar 's melancholy , which is emulation , nor the musician 's , which is fantastical , nor the courtier 's , which is proud , nor the soldier 's , which is ambitious , nor the lawyer 's , which is politic , nor the lady 's , which is nice , nor the lover 's , which is all these : but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry 's contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness .
ROSALIND : A traveller ! By my faith , you have great reason to be sad : I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men 's ; then , to have seen much and to have nothing , is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
JAQUES : Yes , I have gained my experience .
ROSALIND : And your experience makes you sad : I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad ; and to travel for it too ! Enter ORLANDO
ORLANDO : Good day and happiness , dear Rosalind !
JAQUES : Nay , then , God be wi ' you , an you talk in blank verse . Exit
ROSALIND : Farewell , Monsieur Traveller : look you lisp and wear strange suits , disable all the benefits of your own country , be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are , or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola . Why , how now , Orlando ! where have you been all this while ? You a lover ! An you serve me such another trick , never come in my sight more .
ORLANDO : My fair Rosalind , I come within an hour of my promise .
ROSALIND : Break an hour 's promise in love ! He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love , it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o ' the shoulder , but I 'll warrant him heart-whole .
ORLANDO : Pardon me , dear Rosalind .
ROSALIND : Nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight : I had as lief be wooed of a snail .
ORLANDO : Of a snail ?
ROSALIND : Ay , of a snail ; for though he comes slowly , he carries his house on his head ; a better jointure , I think , than you make a woman : besides he brings his destiny with him .
ORLANDO : What 's that ?
ROSALIND : Why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for : but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
ORLANDO : Virtue is no horn-maker ; and my Rosalind is virtuous .
ROSALIND : And I am your Rosalind .
CELIA : It pleases him to call you so ; but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you .
ROSALIND : Come , woo me , woo me , for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent . What would you say to me now , an I were your very very Rosalind ?
ORLANDO : I would kiss before I spoke .
ROSALIND : Nay , you were better speak first , and when you were gravelled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss . Very good orators , when they are out , they will spit ; and for lovers lacking--God warn us ! --matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
ORLANDO : How if the kiss be denied ?
ROSALIND : Then she puts you to entreaty , and there begins new matter .
ORLANDO : Who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
ROSALIND : Marry , that should you , if I were your mistress , or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
ORLANDO : What , of my suit ?
ROSALIND : Not out of your apparel , and yet out of your suit . Am not I your Rosalind ?
ORLANDO : I take some joy to say you are , because I would be talking of her .
ROSALIND : Well in her person I say I will not have you .
ORLANDO : Then in mine own person I die .
