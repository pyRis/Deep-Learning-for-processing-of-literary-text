ROSALIND : No , faith , die by attorney . The poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicit , in a love-cause . Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club ; yet he did what he could to die before , and he is one of the patterns of love . Leander , he would have lived many a fair year , though Hero had turned nun , if it had not been for a hot midsummer night ; for , good youth , he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was ' Hero of Sestos . ' But these are all lies : men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them , but not for love .
ORLANDO : I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind , for , I protest , her frown might kill me .
ROSALIND : By this hand , it will not kill a fly . But come , now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition , and ask me what you will . I will grant it .
ORLANDO : Then love me , Rosalind .
ROSALIND : Yes , faith , will I , Fridays and Saturdays and all .
ORLANDO : And wilt thou have me ?
ROSALIND : Ay , and twenty such .
ORLANDO : What sayest thou ?
ROSALIND : Are you not good ?
ORLANDO : I hope so .
ROSALIND : Why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ? Come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us . Give me your hand , Orlando . What do you say , sister ?
ORLANDO : Pray thee , marry us .
CELIA : I cannot say the words .
ROSALIND : You must begin , ' Will you , Orlando--'
CELIA : Go to . Will you , Orlando , have to wife this Rosalind ?
ORLANDO : I will .
ROSALIND : Ay , but when ?
ORLANDO : Why now ; as fast as she can marry us .
ROSALIND : Then you must say ' I take thee , Rosalind , for wife . ' 
ORLANDO : I take thee , Rosalind , for wife .
ROSALIND : I might ask you for your commission ; but I do take thee , Orlando , for my husband : there 's a girl goes before the priest ; and certainly a woman 's thought runs before her actions .
ORLANDO : So do all thoughts ; they are winged .
ROSALIND : Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
ORLANDO : For ever and a day .
ROSALIND : Say ' a day , ' without the ' ever . ' No , no , Orlando ; men are April when they woo , December when they wed : maids are May when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives . I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more new-fangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey : I will weep for nothing , like Diana in the fountain , and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry ; I will laugh like a hyen , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
ORLANDO : But will my Rosalind do so ?
ROSALIND : By my life , she will do as I do .
ORLANDO : O , but she is wise .
ROSALIND : Or else she could not have the wit to do this : the wiser , the waywarder : make the doors upon a woman 's wit and it will out at the casement ; shut that and ' twill out at the key-hole ; stop that , ' twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
ORLANDO : A man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say ' Wit , whither wilt ? '
ROSALIND : Nay , you might keep that cheque for it till you met your wife 's wit going to your neighbour 's bed .
ORLANDO : And what wit could wit have to excuse that ?
ROSALIND : Marry , to say she came to seek you there . You shall never take her without her answer , unless you take her without her tongue . O , that woman that cannot make her fault her husband 's occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool !
ORLANDO : For these two hours , Rosalind , I will leave thee .
ROSALIND : Alas ! dear love , I cannot lack thee two hours .
ORLANDO : I must attend the duke at dinner : by two o 'clock I will be with thee again .
