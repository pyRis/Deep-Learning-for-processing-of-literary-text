ROSALIND : Ay , go your ways , go your ways ; I knew what you would prove : my friends told me as much , and I thought no less : that flattering tongue of yours won me : ' tis but one cast away , and so , come , death ! Two o 'clock is your hour ?
ORLANDO : Ay , sweet Rosalind .
ROSALIND : By my troth , and in good earnest , and so God mend me , and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous , if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour , I will think you the most pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful : therefore beware my censure and keep your promise .
ORLANDO : With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind : so adieu .
ROSALIND : Well , Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let Time try : adieu . Exit ORLANDO
CELIA : You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate : we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head , and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .
ROSALIND : O coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love ! But it cannot be sounded : my affection hath an unknown bottom , like the bay of Portugal .
CELIA : Or rather , bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
ROSALIND : No , that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses every one 's eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep I am in love . I 'll tell thee , Aliena , I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando : I 'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
CELIA : And I 'll sleep . Enter JAQUES , Lords , and Foresters
JAQUES : Which is he that killed the deer ?
A Lord : Sir , it was I.
JAQUES : Let 's present him to the duke , like a Roman conqueror ; and it would do well to set the deer 's horns upon his head , for a branch of victory . Have you no song , forester , for this purpose ?
Forester : Yes , sir .
JAQUES : Sing it : ' tis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough . SONG .
Forester : What shall he have that kill 'd the deer ? His leather skin and horns to wear . Then sing him home ; The rest shall bear this burden Take thou no scorn to wear the horn ; It was a crest ere thou wast born : Thy father 's father wore it , And thy father bore it : The horn , the horn , the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn . Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
ROSALIND : How say you now ? Is it not past two o 'clock ? and here much Orlando !
CELIA : I warrant you , with pure love and troubled brain , he hath ta 'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep . Look , who comes here . Enter SILVIUS
SILVIUS : My errand is to you , fair youth ; My gentle Phebe bid me give you this : I know not the contents ; but , as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it , It bears an angry tenor : pardon me : I am but as a guiltless messenger .
ROSALIND : Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer ; bear this , bear all : She says I am not fair , that I lack manners ; She calls me proud , and that she could not love me , Were man as rare as phoenix . ' Od 's my will ! Her love is not the hare that I do hunt : Why writes she so to me ? Well , shepherd , well , This is a letter of your own device .
SILVIUS : No , I protest , I know not the contents : Phebe did write it .
