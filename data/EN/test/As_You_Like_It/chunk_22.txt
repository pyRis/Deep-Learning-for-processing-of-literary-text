PHEBE : I would not be thy executioner : I fly thee , for I would not injure thee . Thou tell 'st me there is murder in mine eye : ' Tis pretty , sure , and very probable , That eyes , that are the frail 'st and softest things , Who shut their coward gates on atomies , Should be call 'd tyrants , butchers , murderers ! Now I do frown on thee with all my heart ; And if mine eyes can wound , now let them kill thee : Now counterfeit to swoon ; why now fall down ; Or if thou canst not , O , for shame , for shame , Lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers ! Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee : Scratch thee but with a pin , and there remains Some scar of it ; lean but upon a rush , The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps ; but now mine eyes , Which I have darted at thee , hurt thee not , Nor , I am sure , there is no force in eyes That can do hurt .
SILVIUS : O dear Phebe , If ever , --as that ever may be near , -- You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love 's keen arrows make .
PHEBE : But till that time Come not thou near me : and when that time comes , Afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not ; As till that time I shall not pity thee .
ROSALIND : And why , I pray you ? Who might be your mother , That you insult , exult , and all at once , Over the wretched ? What though you have no beauty , -- As , by my faith , I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed-- Must you be therefore proud and pitiless ? Why , what means this ? Why do you look on me ? I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of nature 's sale-work . ' Od 's my little life , I think she means to tangle my eyes too ! No , faith , proud mistress , hope not after it : ' Tis not your inky brows , your black silk hair , Your bugle eyeballs , nor your cheek of cream , That can entame my spirits to your worship . You foolish shepherd , wherefore do you follow her , Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain ? You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman : ' tis such fools as you That makes the world full of ill-favour 'd children : ' Tis not her glass , but you , that flatters her ; And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her . But , mistress , know yourself : down on your knees , And thank heaven , fasting , for a good man 's love : For I must tell you friendly in your ear , Sell when you can : you are not for all markets : Cry the man mercy ; love him ; take his offer : Foul is most foul , being foul to be a scoffer . So take her to thee , shepherd : fare you well .
PHEBE : Sweet youth , I pray you , chide a year together : I had rather hear you chide than this man woo .
ROSALIND : He 's fallen in love with your foulness and she 'll fall in love with my anger . If it be so , as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks , I 'll sauce her with bitter words . Why look you so upon me ?
PHEBE : For no ill will I bear you .
