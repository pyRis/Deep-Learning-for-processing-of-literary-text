JAQUES : By my troth , I was seeking for a fool when I found you .
ORLANDO : He is drowned in the brook : look but in , and you shall see him .
JAQUES : There I shall see mine own figure .
ORLANDO : Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher .
JAQUES : I 'll tarry no longer with you : farewell , good Signior Love .
ORLANDO : I am glad of your departure : adieu , good Monsieur Melancholy . Exit JAQUES
ROSALIND : I will speak to him , like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him . Do you hear , forester ?
ORLANDO : Very well : what would you ?
ROSALIND : I pray you , what is 't o 'clock ?
ORLANDO : You should ask me what time o ' day : there 's no clock in the forest .
ROSALIND : Then there is no true lover in the forest ; else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock .
ORLANDO : And why not the swift foot of Time ? had not that been as proper ?
ROSALIND : By no means , sir : Time travels in divers paces with divers persons . I 'll tell you who Time ambles withal , who Time trots withal , who Time gallops withal and who he stands still withal .
ORLANDO : I prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
ROSALIND : Marry , he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized : if the interim be but a se 'nnight , Time 's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year .
ORLANDO : Who ambles Time withal ?
ROSALIND : With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout , for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study , and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain , the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning , the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury ; these Time ambles withal .
ORLANDO : Who doth he gallop withal ?
ROSALIND : With a thief to the gallows , for though he go as softly as foot can fall , he thinks himself too soon there .
ORLANDO : Who stays it still withal ?
ROSALIND : With lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves .
ORLANDO : Where dwell you , pretty youth ?
ROSALIND : With this shepherdess , my sister ; here in the skirts of the forest , like fringe upon a petticoat .
ORLANDO : Are you native of this place ?
ROSALIND : As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
ORLANDO : Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
ROSALIND : I have been told so of many : but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man ; one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love . I have heard him read many lectures against it , and I thank God I am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .
ORLANDO : Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
ROSALIND : There were none principal ; they were all like one another as half-pence are , every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it .
ORLANDO : I prithee , recount some of them .
ROSALIND : No , I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick . There is a man haunts the forest , that abuses our young plants with carving ' Rosalind ' on their barks ; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of Rosalind : if I could meet that fancy-monger I would give him some good counsel , for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him .
