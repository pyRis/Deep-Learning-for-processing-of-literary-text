CELIA : No , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs ; throw some of them at me ; come , lame me with reasons .
ROSALIND : Then there were two cousins laid up ; when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .
CELIA : But is all this for your father ?
ROSALIND : No , some of it is for my child 's father . O , how full of briers is this working-day world !
CELIA : They are but burs , cousin , thrown upon thee in holiday foolery : if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
ROSALIND : I could shake them off my coat : these burs are in my heart .
CELIA : Hem them away .
ROSALIND : I would try , if I could cry ' hem ' and have him .
CELIA : Come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
ROSALIND : O , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself !
CELIA : O , a good wish upon you ! you will try in time , in despite of a fall . But , turning these jests out of service , let us talk in good earnest : is it possible , on such a sudden , you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland 's youngest son ?
ROSALIND : The duke my father loved his father dearly .
CELIA : Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ? By this kind of chase , I should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly ; yet I hate not Orlando .
ROSALIND : No , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
CELIA : Why should I not ? doth he not deserve well ?
ROSALIND : Let me love him for that , and do you love him because I do . Look , here comes the duke .
CELIA : With his eyes full of anger . Enter DUKE FREDERICK , with Lords
DUKE FREDERICK : Mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste And get you from our court .
ROSALIND : Me , uncle ?
DUKE FREDERICK : You , cousin Within these ten days if that thou be 'st found So near our public court as twenty miles , Thou diest for it .
ROSALIND : I do beseech your grace , Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me : If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires , If that I do not dream or be not frantic , -- As I do trust I am not--then , dear uncle , Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your highness .
DUKE FREDERICK : Thus do all traitors : If their purgation did consist in words , They are as innocent as grace itself : Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not .
ROSALIND : Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor : Tell me whereon the likelihood depends .
DUKE FREDERICK : Thou art thy father 's daughter ; there 's enough .
ROSALIND : So was I when your highness took his dukedom ; So was I when your highness banish 'd him : Treason is not inherited , my lord ; Or , if we did derive it from our friends , What 's that to me ? my father was no traitor : Then , good my liege , mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous .
CELIA : Dear sovereign , hear me speak .
DUKE FREDERICK : Ay , Celia ; we stay 'd her for your sake , Else had she with her father ranged along .
CELIA : I did not then entreat to have her stay ; It was your pleasure and your own remorse : I was too young that time to value her ; But now I know her : if she be a traitor , Why so am I ; we still have slept together , Rose at an instant , learn 'd , play 'd , eat together , And wheresoever we went , like Juno 's swans , Still we went coupled and inseparable .
