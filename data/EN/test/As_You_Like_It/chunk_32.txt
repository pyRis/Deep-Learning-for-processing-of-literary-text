DUKE SENIOR : That would I , had I kingdoms to give with her .
ROSALIND : And you say , you will have her , when I bring her ?
ORLANDO : That would I , were I of all kingdoms king .
ROSALIND : You say , you 'll marry me , if I be willing ?
PHEBE : That will I , should I die the hour after .
ROSALIND : But if you do refuse to marry me , You 'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
PHEBE : So is the bargain .
ROSALIND : You say , that you 'll have Phebe , if she will ?
SILVIUS : Though to have her and death were both one thing .
ROSALIND : I have promised to make all this matter even . Keep you your word , O duke , to give your daughter ; You yours , Orlando , to receive his daughter : Keep your word , Phebe , that you 'll marry me , Or else refusing me , to wed this shepherd : Keep your word , Silvius , that you 'll marry her . If she refuse me : and from hence I go , To make these doubts all even .
DUKE SENIOR : I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter 's favour .
ORLANDO : My lord , the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter : But , my good lord , this boy is forest-born , And hath been tutor 'd in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle , Whom he reports to be a great magician , Obscured in the circle of this forest . Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
JAQUES : There is , sure , another flood toward , and these couples are coming to the ark . Here comes a pair of very strange beasts , which in all tongues are called fools .
TOUCHSTONE : Salutation and greeting to you all !
JAQUES : Good my lord , bid him welcome : this is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest : he hath been a courtier , he swears .
TOUCHSTONE : If any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation . I have trod a measure ; I have flattered a lady ; I have been politic with my friend , smooth with mine enemy ; I have undone three tailors ; I have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
JAQUES : And how was that ta 'en up ?
TOUCHSTONE : Faith , we met , and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
JAQUES : How seventh cause ? Good my lord , like this fellow .
DUKE SENIOR : I like him very well .
TOUCHSTONE : God ' ild you , sir ; I desire you of the like . I press in here , sir , amongst the rest of the country copulatives , to swear and to forswear : according as marriage binds and blood breaks : a poor virgin , sir , an ill-favoured thing , sir , but mine own ; a poor humour of mine , sir , to take that that no man else will : rich honesty dwells like a miser , sir , in a poor house ; as your pearl in your foul oyster .
DUKE SENIOR : By my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
TOUCHSTONE : According to the fool 's bolt , sir , and such dulcet diseases .
JAQUES : But , for the seventh cause ; how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
