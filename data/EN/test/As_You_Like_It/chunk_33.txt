TOUCHSTONE : Upon a lie seven times removed : --bear your body more seeming , Audrey : --as thus , sir . I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier 's beard : he sent me word , if I said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was : this is called the Retort Courteous . If I sent him word again ' it was not well cut , ' he would send me word , he cut it to please himself : this is called the Quip Modest . If again ' it was not well cut , ' he disabled my judgment : this is called the Reply Churlish . If again ' it was not well cut , ' he would answer , I spake not true : this is called the Reproof Valiant . If again ' it was not well cut , ' he would say I lied : this is called the Counter-cheque Quarrelsome : and so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct .
JAQUES : And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?
TOUCHSTONE : I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial , nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct ; and so we measured swords and parted .
JAQUES : Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie ?
TOUCHSTONE : O sir , we quarrel in print , by the book ; as you have books for good manners : I will name you the degrees . The first , the Retort Courteous ; the second , the Quip Modest ; the third , the Reply Churlish ; the fourth , the Reproof Valiant ; the fifth , the Countercheque Quarrelsome ; the sixth , the Lie with Circumstance ; the seventh , the Lie Direct . All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct ; and you may avoid that too , with an If . I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel , but when the parties were met themselves , one of them thought but of an If , as , ' If you said so , then I said so ; ' and they shook hands and swore brothers . Your If is the only peacemaker ; much virtue in If .
JAQUES : Is not this a rare fellow , my lord ? he 's as good at any thing and yet a fool .
DUKE SENIOR : He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit . Enter HYMEN , ROSALIND , and CELIA Still Music
HYMEN : Then is there mirth in heaven , When earthly things made even Atone together . Good duke , receive thy daughter Hymen from heaven brought her , Yea , brought her hither , That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is .
ROSALIND : To you I give myself , for I am yours . To ORLANDO To you I give myself , for I am yours .
DUKE SENIOR : If there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
ORLANDO : If there be truth in sight , you are my Rosalind .
PHEBE : If sight and shape be true , Why then , my love adieu !
ROSALIND : I 'll have no father , if you be not he : I 'll have no husband , if you be not he : Nor ne 'er wed woman , if you be not she .
HYMEN : Peace , ho ! I bar confusion : ' Tis I must make conclusion Of these most strange events : Here 's eight that must take hands To join in Hymen 's bands , If truth holds true contents . You and you no cross shall part : You and you are heart in heart You to his love must accord , Or have a woman to your lord : You and you are sure together , As the winter to foul weather . Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing , Feed yourselves with questioning ; That reason wonder may diminish , How thus we met , and these things finish . SONG . Wedding is great Juno 's crown : O blessed bond of board and bed ! ' Tis Hymen peoples every town ; High wedlock then be honoured : Honour , high honour and renown , To Hymen , god of every town !
DUKE SENIOR : O my dear niece , welcome thou art to me ! Even daughter , welcome , in no less degree .
PHEBE : I will not eat my word , now thou art mine ; Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine . Enter JAQUES DE BOYS
