OLIVER : When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour , and pacing through the forest , Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy , Lo , what befell ! he threw his eye aside , And mark what object did present itself : Under an oak , whose boughs were moss 'd with age And high top bald with dry antiquity , A wretched ragged man , o 'ergrown with hair , Lay sleeping on his back : about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself , Who with her head nimble in threats approach 'd The opening of his mouth ; but suddenly , Seeing Orlando , it unlink 'd itself , And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush : under which bush 's shade A lioness , with udders all drawn dry , Lay couching , head on ground , with catlike watch , When that the sleeping man should stir ; for ' tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead : This seen , Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother , his elder brother .
CELIA : O , I have heard him speak of that same brother ; And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men .
OLIVER : And well he might so do , For well I know he was unnatural .
ROSALIND : But , to Orlando : did he leave him there , Food to the suck 'd and hungry lioness ?
OLIVER : Twice did he turn his back and purposed so ; But kindness , nobler ever than revenge , And nature , stronger than his just occasion , Made him give battle to the lioness , Who quickly fell before him : in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awaked .
CELIA : Are you his brother ?
ROSALIND : Wast you he rescued ?
CELIA : Was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
OLIVER : ' Twas I ; but ' tis not I I do not shame To tell you what I was , since my conversion So sweetly tastes , being the thing I am .
ROSALIND : But , for the bloody napkin ?
OLIVER : By and by . When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed , As how I came into that desert place : -- In brief , he led me to the gentle duke , Who gave me fresh array and entertainment , Committing me unto my brother 's love ; Who led me instantly unto his cave , There stripp 'd himself , and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away , Which all this while had bled ; and now he fainted And cried , in fainting , upon Rosalind . Brief , I recover 'd him , bound up his wound ; And , after some small space , being strong at heart , He sent me hither , stranger as I am , To tell this story , that you might excuse His broken promise , and to give this napkin Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind . ROSALIND swoons
CELIA : Why , how now , Ganymede ! sweet Ganymede !
OLIVER : Many will swoon when they do look on blood .
CELIA : There is more in it . Cousin Ganymede !
OLIVER : Look , he recovers .
ROSALIND : I would I were at home .
CELIA : We 'll lead you thither . I pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
OLIVER : Be of good cheer , youth : you a man ! you lack a man 's heart .
ROSALIND : I do so , I confess it . Ah , sirrah , a body would think this was well counterfeited ! I pray you , tell your brother how well I counterfeited . Heigh-ho !
OLIVER : This was not counterfeit : there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
ROSALIND : Counterfeit , I assure you .
OLIVER : Well then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .
ROSALIND : So I do : but , i ' faith , I should have been a woman by right .
CELIA : Come , you look paler and paler : pray you , draw homewards . Good sir , go with us .
OLIVER : That will I , for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother , Rosalind .
ROSALIND : I shall devise something : but , I pray you , commend my counterfeiting to him . Will you go ? Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
TOUCHSTONE : We shall find a time , Audrey ; patience , gentle Audrey .
AUDREY : Faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman 's saying .
TOUCHSTONE : A most wicked Sir Oliver , Audrey , a most vile Martext . But , Audrey , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .
AUDREY : Ay , I know who ' tis ; he hath no interest in me in the world : here comes the man you mean .
TOUCHSTONE : It is meat and drink to me to see a clown : by my troth , we that have good wits have much to answer for ; we shall be flouting ; we cannot hold . Enter WILLIAM
