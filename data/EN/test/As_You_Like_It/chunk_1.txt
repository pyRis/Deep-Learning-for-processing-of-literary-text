ORLANDO : I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good .
OLIVER : Get you with him , you old dog .
ADAM : Is ' old dog ' my reward ? Most true , I have lost my teeth in your service . God be with my old master ! he would not have spoke such a word .
OLIVER : Is it even so ? begin you to grow upon me ? I will physic your rankness , and yet give no thousand crowns neither . Holla , Dennis ! Enter DENNIS
DENNIS : Calls your worship ?
OLIVER : Was not Charles , the duke 's wrestler , here to speak with me ?
DENNIS : So please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
OLIVER : Call him in . Exit DENNIS ' Twill be a good way ; and to-morrow the wrestling is . Enter CHARLES
CHARLES : Good morrow to your worship .
OLIVER : Good Monsieur Charles , what 's the new news at the new court ?
CHARLES : There 's no news at the court , sir , but the old news : that is , the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke ; and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him , whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke ; therefore he gives them good leave to wander .
OLIVER : Can you tell if Rosalind , the duke 's daughter , be banished with her father ?
CHARLES : O , no ; for the duke 's daughter , her cousin , so loves her , being ever from their cradles bred together , that she would have followed her exile , or have died to stay behind her . She is at the court , and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter ; and never two ladies loved as they do .
OLIVER : Where will the old duke live ?
CHARLES : They say he is already in the forest of Arden , and a many merry men with him ; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England : they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day , and fleet the time carelessly , as they did in the golden world .
OLIVER : What , you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke ?
CHARLES : Marry , do I , sir ; and I came to acquaint you with a matter . I am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall . To-morrow , sir , I wrestle for my credit ; and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well . Your brother is but young and tender ; and , for your love , I would be loath to foil him , as I must , for my own honour , if he come in : therefore , out of my love to you , I came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
