DUKE SENIOR : Welcome , young man ; Thou offer 'st fairly to thy brothers ' wedding : To one his lands withheld , and to the other A land itself at large , a potent dukedom . First , in this forest , let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot : And after , every of this happy number That have endured shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returned fortune , According to the measure of their states . Meantime , forget this new-fall 'n dignity And fall into our rustic revelry . Play , music ! And you , brides and bridegrooms all , With measure heap 'd in joy , to the measures fall .
JAQUES : Sir , by your patience . If I heard you rightly , The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court ?
JAQUES DE BOYS : He hath .
JAQUES : To him will I : out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learn 'd . To DUKE SENIOR You to your former honour I bequeath ; Your patience and your virtue well deserves it : To ORLANDO You to a love that your true faith doth merit : To OLIVER You to your land and love and great allies : To SILVIUS You to a long and well-deserved bed : To TOUCHSTONE And you to wrangling ; for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victuall 'd . So , to your pleasures : I am for other than for dancing measures .
DUKE SENIOR : Stay , Jaques , stay .
JAQUES : To see no pastime I what you would have I 'll stay to know at your abandon 'd cave . Exit
DUKE SENIOR : Proceed , proceed : we will begin these rites , As we do trust they 'll end , in true delights . A dance EPILOGUE
