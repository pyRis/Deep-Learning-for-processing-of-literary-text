First Page : Well met , honest gentleman .
TOUCHSTONE : By my troth , well met . Come , sit , sit , and a song .
Second Page : We are for you : sit i ' the middle .
First Page : Shall we clap into 't roundly , without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse , which are the only prologues to a bad voice ?
Second Page : I 'faith , i 'faith ; and both in a tune , like two gipsies on a horse . SONG . It was a lover and his lass , With a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , That o 'er the green corn-field did pass In the spring time , the only pretty ring time , When birds do sing , hey ding a ding , ding : Sweet lovers love the spring . Between the acres of the rye , With a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino These pretty country folks would lie , In spring time , & c . This carol they began that hour , With a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , How that a life was but a flower In spring time , & c . And therefore take the present time , With a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino ; For love is crowned with the prime In spring time , & c .
TOUCHSTONE : Truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untuneable .
First Page : You are deceived , sir : we kept time , we lost not our time .
TOUCHSTONE : By my troth , yes ; I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song . God be wi ' you ; and God mend your voices ! Come , Audrey . Enter DUKE SENIOR , AMIENS , JAQUES , ORLANDO , OLIVER , and CELIA
DUKE SENIOR : Dost thou believe , Orlando , that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised ?
ORLANDO : I sometimes do believe , and sometimes do not ; As those that fear they hope , and know they fear . Enter ROSALIND , SILVIUS , and PHEBE
ROSALIND : Patience once more , whiles our compact is urged : You say , if I bring in your Rosalind , You will bestow her on Orlando here ?
