SILVIUS : Sure , it is hers .
ROSALIND : Why , ' tis a boisterous and a cruel style . A style for-challengers ; why , she defies me , Like Turk to Christian : women 's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention Such Ethiope words , blacker in their effect Than in their countenance . Will you hear the letter ?
SILVIUS : So please you , for I never heard it yet ; Yet heard too much of Phebe 's cruelty .
ROSALIND : She Phebes me : mark how the tyrant writes . Reads Art thou god to shepherd turn 'd , That a maiden 's heart hath burn 'd ? Can a woman rail thus ?
SILVIUS : Call you this railing ?
ROSALIND : Why , thy godhead laid apart , Warr 'st thou with a woman 's heart ? Did you ever hear such railing ? Whiles the eye of man did woo me , That could do no vengeance to me . Meaning me a beast . If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine , Alack , in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect ! Whiles you chid me , I did love ; How then might your prayers move ! He that brings this love to thee Little knows this love in me : And by him seal up thy mind ; Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make ; Or else by him my love deny , And then I 'll study how to die .
SILVIUS : Call you this chiding ?
CELIA : Alas , poor shepherd !
ROSALIND : Do you pity him ? no , he deserves no pity . Wilt thou love such a woman ? What , to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee ! not to be endured ! Well , go your way to her , for I see love hath made thee a tame snake , and say this to her : that if she love me , I charge her to love thee ; if she will not , I will never have her unless thou entreat for her . If you be a true lover , hence , and not a word ; for here comes more company . Exit SILVIUS Enter OLIVER
OLIVER : Good morrow , fair ones : pray you , if you know , Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees ?
CELIA : West of this place , down in the neighbour bottom : The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place . But at this hour the house doth keep itself ; There 's none within .
OLIVER : If that an eye may profit by a tongue , Then should I know you by description ; Such garments and such years : ' The boy is fair , Of female favour , and bestows himself Like a ripe sister : the woman low And browner than her brother . ' Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for ?
CELIA : It is no boast , being ask 'd , to say we are .
OLIVER : Orlando doth commend him to you both , And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin . Are you he ?
ROSALIND : I am : what must we understand by this ?
OLIVER : Some of my shame ; if you will know of me What man I am , and how , and why , and where This handkercher was stain 'd .
CELIA : I pray you , tell it .
