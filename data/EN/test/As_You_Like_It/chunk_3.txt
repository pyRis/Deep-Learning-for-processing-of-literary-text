ROSALIND : Where learned you that oath , fool ?
TOUCHSTONE : Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught : now I 'll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
CELIA : How prove you that , in the great heap of your knowledge ?
ROSALIND : Ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
TOUCHSTONE : Stand you both forth now : stroke your chins , and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
CELIA : By our beards , if we had them , thou art .
TOUCHSTONE : By my knavery , if I had it , then I were ; but if you swear by that that is not , you are not forsworn : no more was this knight swearing by his honour , for he never had any ; or if he had , he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard .
CELIA : Prithee , who is 't that thou meanest ?
TOUCHSTONE : One that old Frederick , your father , loves .
CELIA : My father 's love is enough to honour him : enough ! speak no more of him ; you 'll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
TOUCHSTONE : The more pity , that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
CELIA : By my troth , thou sayest true ; for since the little wit that fools have was silenced , the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show . Here comes Monsieur Le Beau .
ROSALIND : With his mouth full of news .
CELIA : Which he will put on us , as pigeons feed their young .
ROSALIND : Then shall we be news-crammed .
CELIA : All the better ; we shall be the more marketable . Enter LE BEAU Bon jour , Monsieur Le Beau : what 's the news ?
LE BEAU : Fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
CELIA : Sport ! of what colour ?
LE BEAU : What colour , madam ! how shall I answer you ?
ROSALIND : As wit and fortune will .
TOUCHSTONE : Or as the Destinies decree .
CELIA : Well said : that was laid on with a trowel .
TOUCHSTONE : Nay , if I keep not my rank , --
ROSALIND : Thou losest thy old smell .
LE BEAU : You amaze me , ladies : I would have told you of good wrestling , which you have lost the sight of .
ROSALIND : You tell us the manner of the wrestling .
LE BEAU : I will tell you the beginning ; and , if it please your ladyships , you may see the end ; for the best is yet to do ; and here , where you are , they are coming to perform it .
CELIA : Well , the beginning , that is dead and buried .
LE BEAU : There comes an old man and his three sons , --
CELIA : I could match this beginning with an old tale .
LE BEAU : Three proper young men , of excellent growth and presence .
ROSALIND : With bills on their necks , ' Be it known unto all men by these presents . ' 
LE BEAU : The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles , the duke 's wrestler ; which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him : so he served the second , and so the third . Yonder they lie ; the poor old man , their father , making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
ROSALIND : Alas !
TOUCHSTONE : But what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?
LE BEAU : Why , this that I speak of .
TOUCHSTONE : Thus men may grow wiser every day : it is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies .
CELIA : Or I , I promise thee .
