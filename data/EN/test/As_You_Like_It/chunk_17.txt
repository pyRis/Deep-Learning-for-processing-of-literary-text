CELIA : Nay , he hath but a little beard .
ROSALIND : Why , God will send more , if the man will be thankful : let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
CELIA : It is young Orlando , that tripped up the wrestler 's heels and your heart both in an instant .
ROSALIND : Nay , but the devil take mocking : speak , sad brow and true maid .
CELIA : I ' faith , coz , ' tis he .
ROSALIND : Orlando ?
CELIA : Orlando .
ROSALIND : Alas the day ! what shall I do with my doublet and hose ? What did he when thou sawest him ? What said he ? How looked he ? Wherein went he ? What makes him here ? Did he ask for me ? Where remains he ? How parted he with thee ? and when shalt thou see him again ? Answer me in one word .
CELIA : You must borrow me Gargantua 's mouth first : ' tis a word too great for any mouth of this age 's size . To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism .
ROSALIND : But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man 's apparel ? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
CELIA : It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover ; but take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance . I found him under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
ROSALIND : It may well be called Jove 's tree , when it drops forth such fruit .
CELIA : Give me audience , good madam .
ROSALIND : Proceed .
CELIA : There lay he , stretched along , like a wounded knight .
ROSALIND : Though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
CELIA : Cry ' holla ' to thy tongue , I prithee ; it curvets unseasonably . He was furnished like a hunter .
ROSALIND : O , ominous ! he comes to kill my heart .
CELIA : I would sing my song without a burden : thou bringest me out of tune .
ROSALIND : Do you not know I am a woman ? when I think , I must speak . Sweet , say on .
CELIA : You bring me out . Soft ! comes he not here ? Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
ROSALIND : ' Tis he : slink by , and note him .
JAQUES : I thank you for your company ; but , good faith , I had as lief have been myself alone .
ORLANDO : And so had I ; but yet , for fashion sake , I thank you too for your society .
JAQUES : God be wi ' you : let 's meet as little as we can .
ORLANDO : I do desire we may be better strangers .
JAQUES : I pray you , mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their barks .
ORLANDO : I pray you , mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly .
JAQUES : Rosalind is your love 's name ?
ORLANDO : Yes , just .
JAQUES : I do not like her name .
ORLANDO : There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened .
JAQUES : What stature is she of ?
ORLANDO : Just as high as my heart .
JAQUES : You are full of pretty answers . Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths ' wives , and conned them out of rings ?
ORLANDO : Not so ; but I answer you right painted cloth , from whence you have studied your questions .
JAQUES : You have a nimble wit : I think ' twas made of Atalanta 's heels . Will you sit down with me ? and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery .
ORLANDO : I will chide no breather in the world but myself , against whom I know most faults .
JAQUES : The worst fault you have is to be in love .
