ROSALIND : Ay , be so , good Touchstone . Enter CORIN and SILVIUS Look you , who comes here ; a young man and an old in solemn talk .
CORIN : That is the way to make her scorn you still .
SILVIUS : O Corin , that thou knew 'st how I do love her !
CORIN : I partly guess ; for I have loved ere now .
SILVIUS : No , Corin , being old , thou canst not guess , Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sigh 'd upon a midnight pillow : But if thy love were ever like to mine-- As sure I think did never man love so-- How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?
CORIN : Into a thousand that I have forgotten .
SILVIUS : O , thou didst then ne 'er love so heartily ! If thou remember 'st not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into , Thou hast not loved : Or if thou hast not sat as I do now , Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress ' praise , Thou hast not loved : Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly , as my passion now makes me , Thou hast not loved . O Phebe , Phebe , Phebe ! Exit
ROSALIND : Alas , poor shepherd ! searching of thy wound , I have by hard adventure found mine own .
TOUCHSTONE : And I mine . I remember , when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile ; and I remember the kissing of her batlet and the cow 's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milked ; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom I took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears ' Wear these for my sake . ' We that are true lovers run into strange capers ; but as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
ROSALIND : Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of .
TOUCHSTONE : Nay , I shall ne 'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it .
ROSALIND : Jove , Jove ! this shepherd 's passion Is much upon my fashion .
TOUCHSTONE : And mine ; but it grows something stale with me .
CELIA : I pray you , one of you question yond man If he for gold will give us any food : I faint almost to death .
TOUCHSTONE : Holla , you clown !
ROSALIND : Peace , fool : he 's not thy kinsman .
CORIN : Who calls ?
TOUCHSTONE : Your betters , sir .
CORIN : Else are they very wretched .
ROSALIND : Peace , I say . Good even to you , friend .
CORIN : And to you , gentle sir , and to you all .
ROSALIND : I prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment , Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed : Here 's a young maid with travel much oppress 'd And faints for succor .
CORIN : Fair sir , I pity her And wish , for her sake more than for mine own , My fortunes were more able to relieve her ; But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze : My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality : Besides , his cote , his flocks and bounds of feed Are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , By reason of his absence , there is nothing That you will feed on ; but what is , come see . And in my voice most welcome shall you be .
ROSALIND : What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?
CORIN : That young swain that you saw here but erewhile , That little cares for buying any thing .
ROSALIND : I pray thee , if it stand with honesty , Buy thou the cottage , pasture and the flock , And thou shalt have to pay for it of us .
