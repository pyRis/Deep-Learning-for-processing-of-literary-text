ROSALIND : I pray you , do not fall in love with me , For I am falser than vows made in wine : Besides , I like you not . If you will know my house , ' Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by . Will you go , sister ? Shepherd , ply her hard . Come , sister . Shepherdess , look on him better , And be not proud : though all the world could see , None could be so abused in sight as he . Come , to our flock .
PHEBE : Dead Shepherd , now I find thy saw of might , ' Who ever loved that loved not at first sight ? '
SILVIUS : Sweet Phebe , --
PHEBE : Ha , what say 'st thou , Silvius ?
SILVIUS : Sweet Phebe , pity me .
PHEBE : Why , I am sorry for thee , gentle Silvius .
SILVIUS : Wherever sorrow is , relief would be : If you do sorrow at my grief in love , By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined .
PHEBE : Thou hast my love : is not that neighbourly ?
SILVIUS : I would have you .
PHEBE : Why , that were covetousness . Silvius , the time was that I hated thee , And yet it is not that I bear thee love ; But since that thou canst talk of love so well , Thy company , which erst was irksome to me , I will endure , and I 'll employ thee too : But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employ 'd .
SILVIUS : So holy and so perfect is my love , And I in such a poverty of grace , That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps : loose now and then A scatter 'd smile , and that I 'll live upon .
PHEBE : Know 'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
SILVIUS : Not very well , but I have met him oft ; And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of .
PHEBE : Think not I love him , though I ask for him : ' Tis but a peevish boy ; yet he talks well ; But what care I for words ? yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear . It is a pretty youth : not very pretty : But , sure , he 's proud , and yet his pride becomes him : He 'll make a proper man : the best thing in him Is his complexion ; and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up . He is not very tall ; yet for his years he 's tall : His leg is but so so ; and yet ' tis well : There was a pretty redness in his lip , A little riper and more lusty red Than that mix 'd in his cheek ; ' twas just the difference Between the constant red and mingled damask . There be some women , Silvius , had they mark 'd him In parcels as I did , would have gone near To fall in love with him ; but , for my part , I love him not nor hate him not ; and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him : For what had he to do to chide at me ? He said mine eyes were black and my hair black : And , now I am remember 'd , scorn 'd at me : I marvel why I answer 'd not again : But that 's all one ; omittance is no quittance . I 'll write to him a very taunting letter , And thou shalt bear it : wilt thou , Silvius ?
SILVIUS : Phebe , with all my heart .
PHEBE : I 'll write it straight ; The matter 's in my head and in my heart : I will be bitter with him and passing short . Go with me , Silvius . Enter ROSALIND , CELIA , and JAQUES
JAQUES : I prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
ROSALIND : They say you are a melancholy fellow .
JAQUES : I am so ; I do love it better than laughing .
ROSALIND : Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .
JAQUES : Why , ' tis good to be sad and say nothing .
ROSALIND : Why then , ' tis good to be a post .
