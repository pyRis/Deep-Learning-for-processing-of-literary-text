TOUCHSTONE : Truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
ROSALIND : I 'll graff it with you , and then I shall graff it with a medlar : then it will be the earliest fruit i ' the country ; for you 'll be rotten ere you be half ripe , and that 's the right virtue of the medlar .
TOUCHSTONE : You have said ; but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge . Enter CELIA , with a writing
ROSALIND : Peace ! Here comes my sister , reading : stand aside .
CELIA : Why should this a desert be ? For it is unpeopled ? No : Tongues I 'll hang on every tree , That shall civil sayings show : Some , how brief the life of man Runs his erring pilgrimage , That the stretching of a span Buckles in his sum of age ; Some , of violated vows ' Twixt the souls of friend and friend : But upon the fairest boughs , Or at every sentence end , Will I Rosalinda write , Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show . Therefore Heaven Nature charged That one body should be fill 'd With all graces wide-enlarged : Nature presently distill 'd Helen 's cheek , but not her heart , Cleopatra 's majesty , Atalanta 's better part , Sad Lucretia 's modesty . Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised , Of many faces , eyes and hearts , To have the touches dearest prized . Heaven would that she these gifts should have , And I to live and die her slave .
ROSALIND : O most gentle pulpiter ! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal , and never cried ' Have patience , good people ! '
CELIA : How now ! back , friends ! Shepherd , go off a little . Go with him , sirrah .
TOUCHSTONE : Come , shepherd , let us make an honourable retreat ; though not with bag and baggage , yet with scrip and scrippage .
CELIA : Didst thou hear these verses ?
ROSALIND : O , yes , I heard them all , and more too ; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
CELIA : That 's no matter : the feet might bear the verses .
ROSALIND : Ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
CELIA : But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?
ROSALIND : I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came ; for look here what I found on a palm-tree . I was never so be-rhymed since Pythagoras ' time , that I was an Irish rat , which I can hardly remember .
CELIA : Trow you who hath done this ?
ROSALIND : Is it a man ?
CELIA : And a chain , that you once wore , about his neck . Change you colour ?
ROSALIND : I prithee , who ?
CELIA : O Lord , Lord ! it is a hard matter for friends to meet ; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
ROSALIND : Nay , but who is it ?
CELIA : Is it possible ?
ROSALIND : Nay , I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .
CELIA : O wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful ! and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all hooping !
ROSALIND : Good my complexion ! dost thou think , though I am caparisoned like a man , I have a doublet and hose in my disposition ? One inch of delay more is a South-sea of discovery ; I prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace . I would thou couldst stammer , that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth , as wine comes out of a narrow- mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all . I prithee , take the cork out of thy mouth that may drink thy tidings .
CELIA : So you may put a man in your belly .
