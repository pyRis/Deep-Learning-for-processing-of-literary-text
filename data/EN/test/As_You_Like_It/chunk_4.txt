ROSALIND : But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking ? Shall we see this wrestling , cousin ?
LE BEAU : You must , if you stay here ; for here is the place appointed for the wrestling , and they are ready to perform it .
CELIA : Yonder , sure , they are coming : let us now stay and see it . Flourish . Enter DUKE FREDERICK , Lords , ORLANDO , CHARLES , and Attendants
DUKE FREDERICK : Come on : since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
ROSALIND : Is yonder the man ?
LE BEAU : Even he , madam .
CELIA : Alas , he is too young ! yet he looks successfully .
DUKE FREDERICK : How now , daughter and cousin ! are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
ROSALIND : Ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
DUKE FREDERICK : You will take little delight in it , I can tell you ; there is such odds in the man . In pity of the challenger 's youth I would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated . Speak to him , ladies ; see if you can move him .
CELIA : Call him hither , good Monsieur Le Beau .
DUKE FREDERICK : Do so : I 'll not be by .
LE BEAU : Monsieur the challenger , the princesses call for you .
ORLANDO : I attend them with all respect and duty .
ROSALIND : Young man , have you challenged Charles the wrestler ?
ORLANDO : No , fair princess ; he is the general challenger : I come but in , as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
CELIA : Young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years . You have seen cruel proof of this man 's strength : if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise . We pray you , for your own sake , to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
ROSALIND : Do , young sir ; your reputation shall not therefore be misprised : we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward .
ORLANDO : I beseech you , punish me not with your hard thoughts ; wherein I confess me much guilty , to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing . But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial : wherein if I be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious ; if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so : I shall do my friends no wrong , for I have none to lament me , the world no injury , for in it I have nothing ; only in the world I fill up a place , which may be better supplied when I have made it empty .
ROSALIND : The little strength that I have , I would it were with you .
CELIA : And mine , to eke out hers .
ROSALIND : Fare you well : pray heaven I be deceived in you !
CELIA : Your heart 's desires be with you !
CHARLES : Come , where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ?
ORLANDO : Ready , sir ; but his will hath in it a more modest working .
DUKE FREDERICK : You shall try but one fall .
CHARLES : No , I warrant your grace , you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
ORLANDO : An you mean to mock me after , you should not have mocked me before : but come your ways .
ROSALIND : Now Hercules be thy speed , young man !
CELIA : I would I were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg . They wrestle
ROSALIND : O excellent young man !
CELIA : If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye , I can tell who should down . Shout . CHARLES is thrown
DUKE FREDERICK : No more , no more .
ORLANDO : Yes , I beseech your grace : I am not yet well breathed .
DUKE FREDERICK : How dost thou , Charles ?
