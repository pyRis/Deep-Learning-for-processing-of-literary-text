ADAM : What , my young master ? O , my gentle master ! O my sweet master ! O you memory Of old Sir Rowland ! why , what make you here ? Why are you virtuous ? why do people love you ? And wherefore are you gentle , strong and valiant ? Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny priser of the humorous duke ? Your praise is come too swiftly home before you . Know you not , master , to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies ? No more do yours : your virtues , gentle master , Are sanctified and holy traitors to you . O , what a world is this , when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it !
ORLANDO : Why , what 's the matter ?
ADAM : O unhappy youth ! Come not within these doors ; within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives : Your brother--no , no brother ; yet the son-- Yet not the son , I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father-- Hath heard your praises , and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie And you within it : if he fail of that , He will have other means to cut you off . I overheard him and his practises . This is no place ; this house is but a butchery : Abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
ORLANDO : Why , whither , Adam , wouldst thou have me go ?
ADAM : No matter whither , so you come not here .
ORLANDO : What , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food ? Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road ? This I must do , or know not what to do : Yet this I will not do , do how I can ; I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
ADAM : But do not so . I have five hundred crowns , The thrifty hire I saved under your father , Which I did store to be my foster-nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame And unregarded age in corners thrown : Take that , and He that doth the ravens feed , Yea , providently caters for the sparrow , Be comfort to my age ! Here is the gold ; And all this I give you . Let me be your servant : Though I look old , yet I am strong and lusty ; For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood , Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility ; Therefore my age is as a lusty winter , Frosty , but kindly : let me go with you ; I 'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities .
ORLANDO : O good old man , how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world , When service sweat for duty , not for meed ! Thou art not for the fashion of these times , Where none will sweat but for promotion , And having that , do choke their service up Even with the having : it is not so with thee . But , poor old man , thou prunest a rotten tree , That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry But come thy ways ; well go along together , And ere we have thy youthful wages spent , We 'll light upon some settled low content .
ADAM : Master , go on , and I will follow thee , To the last gasp , with truth and loyalty . From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I , but now live here no more . At seventeen years many their fortunes seek ; But at fourscore it is too late a week : Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well and not my master 's debtor . Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede , CELIA for Aliena , and TOUCHSTONE
ROSALIND : O Jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
TOUCHSTONE : I care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
ROSALIND : I could find in my heart to disgrace my man 's apparel and to cry like a woman ; but I must comfort the weaker vessel , as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat : therefore courage , good Aliena !
CELIA : I pray you , bear with me ; I cannot go no further .
TOUCHSTONE : For my part , I had rather bear with you than bear you ; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you , for I think you have no money in your purse .
ROSALIND : Well , this is the forest of Arden .
