ROSALIND : There is none of my uncle 's marks upon you : he taught me how to know a man in love ; in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner .
ORLANDO : What were his marks ?
ROSALIND : A lean cheek , which you have not , a blue eye and sunken , which you have not , an unquestionable spirit , which you have not , a beard neglected , which you have not ; but I pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother 's revenue : then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation ; but you are no such man ; you are rather point-device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
ORLANDO : Fair youth , I would I could make thee believe I love .
ROSALIND : Me believe it ! you may as soon make her that you love believe it ; which , I warrant , she is apter to do than to confess she does : that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences . But , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees , wherein Rosalind is so admired ?
ORLANDO : I swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of Rosalind , I am that he , that unfortunate he .
ROSALIND : But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
ORLANDO : Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
ROSALIND : Love is merely a madness , and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do : and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is , that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too . Yet I profess curing it by counsel .
ORLANDO : Did you ever cure any so ?
ROSALIND : Yes , one , and in this manner . He was to imagine me his love , his mistress ; and I set him every day to woo me : at which time would I , being but a moonish youth , grieve , be effeminate , changeable , longing and liking , proud , fantastical , apish , shallow , inconstant , full of tears , full of smiles , for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing , as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour ; would now like him , now loathe him ; then entertain him , then forswear him ; now weep for him , then spit at him ; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness ; which was , to forswear the full stream of the world , and to live in a nook merely monastic . And thus I cured him ; and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep 's heart , that there shall not be one spot of love in 't .
ORLANDO : I would not be cured , youth .
ROSALIND : I would cure you , if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
ORLANDO : Now , by the faith of my love , I will : tell me where it is .
ROSALIND : Go with me to it and I 'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live . Will you go ?
ORLANDO : With all my heart , good youth .
ROSALIND : Nay you must call me Rosalind . Come , sister , will you go ? Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY ; JAQUES behind
TOUCHSTONE : Come apace , good Audrey : I will fetch up your goats , Audrey . And how , Audrey ? am I the man yet ? doth my simple feature content you ?
AUDREY : Your features ! Lord warrant us ! what features !
TOUCHSTONE : I am here with thee and thy goats , as the most capricious poet , honest Ovid , was among the Goths .
