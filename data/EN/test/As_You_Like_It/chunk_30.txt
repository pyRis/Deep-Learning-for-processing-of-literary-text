ROSALIND : I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
ORLANDO : Wounded it is , but with the eyes of a lady .
ROSALIND : Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkerchief ?
ORLANDO : Ay , and greater wonders than that .
ROSALIND : O , I know where you are : nay , ' tis true : there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar 's thrasonical brag of ' I came , saw , and overcame : ' for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked , no sooner looked but they loved , no sooner loved but they sighed , no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason , no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy ; and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent , or else be incontinent before marriage : they are in the very wrath of love and they will together ; clubs cannot part them .
ORLANDO : They shall be married to-morrow , and I will bid the duke to the nuptial . But , O , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man 's eyes ! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness , by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
ROSALIND : Why then , to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind ?
ORLANDO : I can live no longer by thinking .
ROSALIND : I will weary you then no longer with idle talking . Know of me then , for now I speak to some purpose , that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit : I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch I say I know you are ; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you , to do yourself good and not to grace me . Believe then , if you please , that I can do strange things : I have , since I was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable . If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries Aliena , shall you marry her : I know into what straits of fortune she is driven ; and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger .
ORLANDO : Speakest thou in sober meanings ?
ROSALIND : By my life , I do ; which I tender dearly , though I say I am a magician . Therefore , put you in your best array : bid your friends ; for if you will be married to-morrow , you shall , and to Rosalind , if you will . Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE Look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
PHEBE : Youth , you have done me much ungentleness , To show the letter that I writ to you .
ROSALIND : I care not if I have : it is my study To seem despiteful and ungentle to you : You are there followed by a faithful shepherd ; Look upon him , love him ; he worships you .
PHEBE : Good shepherd , tell this youth what ' tis to love .
SILVIUS : It is to be all made of sighs and tears ; And so am I for Phebe .
PHEBE : And I for Ganymede .
ORLANDO : And I for Rosalind .
ROSALIND : And I for no woman .
SILVIUS : It is to be all made of faith and service ; And so am I for Phebe .
PHEBE : And I for Ganymede .
ORLANDO : And I for Rosalind .
ROSALIND : And I for no woman .
SILVIUS : It is to be all made of fantasy , All made of passion and all made of wishes , All adoration , duty , and observance , All humbleness , all patience and impatience , All purity , all trial , all observance ; And so am I for Phebe .
