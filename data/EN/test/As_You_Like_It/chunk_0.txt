ORLANDO : As I remember , Adam , it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns , and , as thou sayest , charged my brother , on his blessing , to breed me well : and there begins my sadness . My brother Jaques he keeps at school , and report speaks goldenly of his profit : for my part , he keeps me rustically at home , or , to speak more properly , stays me here at home unkept ; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth , that differs not from the stalling of an ox ? His horses are bred better ; for , besides that they are fair with their feeding , they are taught their manage , and to that end riders dearly hired : but I , his brother , gain nothing under him but growth ; for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me , the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me : he lets me feed with his hinds , bars me the place of a brother , and , as much as in him lies , mines my gentility with my education . This is it , Adam , that grieves me ; and the spirit of my father , which I think is within me , begins to mutiny against this servitude : I will no longer endure it , though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it .
ADAM : Yonder comes my master , your brother .
ORLANDO : Go apart , Adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up . Enter OLIVER
OLIVER : Now , sir ! what make you here ?
ORLANDO : Nothing : I am not taught to make any thing .
OLIVER : What mar you then , sir ?
ORLANDO : Marry , sir , I am helping you to mar that which God made , a poor unworthy brother of yours , with idleness .
OLIVER : Marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
ORLANDO : Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them ? What prodigal portion have I spent , that I should come to such penury ?
OLIVER : Know you where your are , sir ?
ORLANDO : O , sir , very well ; here in your orchard .
OLIVER : Know you before whom , sir ?
ORLANDO : Ay , better than him I am before knows me . I know you are my eldest brother ; and , in the gentle condition of blood , you should so know me . The courtesy of nations allows you my better , in that you are the first-born ; but the same tradition takes not away my blood , were there twenty brothers betwixt us : I have as much of my father in me as you ; albeit , I confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
OLIVER : What , boy !
ORLANDO : Come , come , elder brother , you are too young in this .
OLIVER : Wilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?
ORLANDO : I am no villain ; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys ; he was my father , and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains . Wert thou not my brother , I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so : thou hast railed on thyself .
ADAM : Sweet masters , be patient : for your father 's remembrance , be at accord .
OLIVER : Let me go , I say .
ORLANDO : I will not , till I please : you shall hear me . My father charged you in his will to give me good education : you have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities . The spirit of my father grows strong in me , and I will no longer endure it : therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman , or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament ; with that I will go buy my fortunes .
