First Lord : Indeed , my lord , The melancholy Jaques grieves at that , And , in that kind , swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banish 'd you . To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood : To the which place a poor sequester 'd stag , That from the hunter 's aim had ta 'en a hurt , Did come to languish , and indeed , my lord , The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting , and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase ; and thus the hairy fool Much marked of the melancholy Jaques , Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook , Augmenting it with tears .
DUKE SENIOR : But what said Jaques ? Did he not moralize this spectacle ?
First Lord : O , yes , into a thousand similes . First , for his weeping into the needless stream ; ' Poor deer , ' quoth he , ' thou makest a testament As worldlings do , giving thy sum of more To that which had too much : ' then , being there alone , Left and abandon 'd of his velvet friends , ' ' Tis right : ' quoth he ; ' thus misery doth part The flux of company : ' anon a careless herd , Full of the pasture , jumps along by him And never stays to greet him ; ' Ay ' quoth Jaques , ' Sweep on , you fat and greasy citizens ; ' Tis just the fashion : wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there ? ' Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country , city , court , Yea , and of this our life , swearing that we Are mere usurpers , tyrants and what 's worse , To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assign 'd and native dwelling-place .
DUKE SENIOR : And did you leave him in this contemplation ?
Second Lord : We did , my lord , weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer .
DUKE SENIOR : Show me the place : I love to cope him in these sullen fits , For then he 's full of matter .
First Lord : I 'll bring you to him straight . Enter DUKE FREDERICK , with Lords
DUKE FREDERICK : Can it be possible that no man saw them ? It cannot be : some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this .
First Lord : I cannot hear of any that did see her . The ladies , her attendants of her chamber , Saw her abed , and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
Second Lord : My lord , the roynish clown , at whom so oft Your grace was wont to laugh , is also missing . Hisperia , the princess ' gentlewoman , Confesses that she secretly o 'erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles ; And she believes , wherever they are gone , That youth is surely in their company .
DUKE FREDERICK : Send to his brother ; fetch that gallant hither ; If he be absent , bring his brother to me ; I 'll make him find him : do this suddenly , And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways . Enter ORLANDO and ADAM , meeting
ORLANDO : Who 's there ?
