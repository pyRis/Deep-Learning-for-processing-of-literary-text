TOUCHSTONE : Such a one is a natural philosopher . Wast ever in court , shepherd ?
CORIN : No , truly .
TOUCHSTONE : Then thou art damned .
CORIN : Nay , I hope .
TOUCHSTONE : Truly , thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg , all on one side .
CORIN : For not being at court ? Your reason .
TOUCHSTONE : Why , if thou never wast at court , thou never sawest good manners ; if thou never sawest good manners , then thy manners must be wicked ; and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation . Thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
CORIN : Not a whit , Touchstone : those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court . You told me you salute not at the court , but you kiss your hands : that courtesy would be uncleanly , if courtiers were shepherds .
TOUCHSTONE : Instance , briefly ; come , instance .
CORIN : Why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
TOUCHSTONE : Why , do not your courtier 's hands sweat ? and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ? Shallow , shallow . A better instance , I say ; come .
CORIN : Besides , our hands are hard .
TOUCHSTONE : Your lips will feel them the sooner . Shallow again . A more sounder instance , come .
CORIN : And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep : and would you have us kiss tar ? The courtier 's hands are perfumed with civet .
TOUCHSTONE : Most shallow man ! thou worms-meat , in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed ! Learn of the wise , and perpend : civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat . Mend the instance , shepherd .
CORIN : You have too courtly a wit for me : I 'll rest .
TOUCHSTONE : Wilt thou rest damned ? God help thee , shallow man ! God make incision in thee ! thou art raw .
CORIN : Sir , I am a true labourer : I earn that I eat , get that I wear , owe no man hate , envy no man 's happiness , glad of other men 's good , content with my harm , and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck .
TOUCHSTONE : That is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bell-wether , and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated , old , cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match . If thou beest not damned for this , the devil himself will have no shepherds ; I cannot see else how thou shouldst ' scape .
CORIN : Here comes young Master Ganymede , my new mistress 's brother . Enter ROSALIND , with a paper , reading
ROSALIND : From the east to western Ind , No jewel is like Rosalind . Her worth , being mounted on the wind , Through all the world bears Rosalind . All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind . Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind .
TOUCHSTONE : I 'll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping-hours excepted : it is the right butter-women 's rank to market .
ROSALIND : Out , fool !
TOUCHSTONE : For a taste : If a hart do lack a hind , Let him seek out Rosalind . If the cat will after kind , So be sure will Rosalind . Winter garments must be lined , So must slender Rosalind . They that reap must sheaf and bind ; Then to cart with Rosalind . Sweetest nut hath sourest rind , Such a nut is Rosalind . He that sweetest rose will find Must find love 's prick and Rosalind . This is the very false gallop of verses : why do you infect yourself with them ?
