DUKE SENIOR : I think he be transform 'd into a beast ; For I can no where find him like a man .
First Lord : My lord , he is but even now gone hence : Here was he merry , hearing of a song .
DUKE SENIOR : If he , compact of jars , grow musical , We shall have shortly discord in the spheres . Go , seek him : tell him I would speak with him . Enter JAQUES
First Lord : He saves my labour by his own approach .
DUKE SENIOR : Why , how now , monsieur ! what a life is this , That your poor friends must woo your company ? What , you look merrily !
JAQUES : A fool , a fool ! I met a fool i ' the forest , A motley fool ; a miserable world ! As I do live by food , I met a fool Who laid him down and bask 'd him in the sun , And rail 'd on Lady Fortune in good terms , In good set terms and yet a motley fool . ' Good morrow , fool , ' quoth I. ' No , sir , ' quoth he , ' Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune : ' And then he drew a dial from his poke , And , looking on it with lack-lustre eye , Says very wisely , ' It is ten o 'clock : Thus we may see , ' quoth he , ' how the world wags : ' Tis but an hour ago since it was nine , And after one hour more ' twill be eleven ; And so , from hour to hour , we ripe and ripe , And then , from hour to hour , we rot and rot ; And thereby hangs a tale . ' When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time , My lungs began to crow like chanticleer , That fools should be so deep-contemplative , And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial . O noble fool ! A worthy fool ! Motley 's the only wear .
DUKE SENIOR : What fool is this ?
JAQUES : O worthy fool ! One that hath been a courtier , And says , if ladies be but young and fair , They have the gift to know it : and in his brain , Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage , he hath strange places cramm 'd With observation , the which he vents In mangled forms . O that I were a fool ! I am ambitious for a motley coat .
DUKE SENIOR : Thou shalt have one .
JAQUES : It is my only suit ; Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise . I must have liberty Withal , as large a charter as the wind , To blow on whom I please ; for so fools have ; And they that are most galled with my folly , They most must laugh . And why , sir , must they so ? The ' why ' is plain as way to parish church : He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly , although he smart , Not to seem senseless of the bob : if not , The wise man 's folly is anatomized Even by the squandering glances of the fool . Invest me in my motley ; give me leave To speak my mind , and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of the infected world , If they will patiently receive my medicine .
DUKE SENIOR : Fie on thee ! I can tell what thou wouldst do .
JAQUES : What , for a counter , would I do but good ?
DUKE SENIOR : Most mischievous foul sin , in chiding sin : For thou thyself hast been a libertine , As sensual as the brutish sting itself ; And all the embossed sores and headed evils , That thou with licence of free foot hast caught , Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .
