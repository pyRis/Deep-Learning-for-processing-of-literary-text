JAQUES : Why , who cries out on pride , That can therein tax any private party ? Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea , Till that the weary very means do ebb ? What woman in the city do I name , When that I say the city-woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders ? Who can come in and say that I mean her , When such a one as she such is her neighbour ? Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not of my cost , Thinking that I mean him , but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech ? There then ; how then ? what then ? Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong 'd him : if it do him right , Then he hath wrong 'd himself ; if he be free , Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies , Unclaim 'd of any man . But who comes here ? Enter ORLANDO , with his sword drawn
ORLANDO : Forbear , and eat no more .
JAQUES : Why , I have eat none yet .
ORLANDO : Nor shalt not , till necessity be served .
JAQUES : Of what kind should this cock come of ?
DUKE SENIOR : Art thou thus bolden 'd , man , by thy distress , Or else a rude despiser of good manners , That in civility thou seem 'st so empty ?
ORLANDO : You touch 'd my vein at first : the thorny point Of bare distress hath ta 'en from me the show Of smooth civility : yet am I inland bred And know some nurture . But forbear , I say : He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answered .
JAQUES : An you will not be answered with reason , I must die .
DUKE SENIOR : What would you have ? Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness .
ORLANDO : I almost die for food ; and let me have it .
DUKE SENIOR : Sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
ORLANDO : Speak you so gently ? Pardon me , I pray you : I thought that all things had been savage here ; And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment . But whate 'er you are That in this desert inaccessible , Under the shade of melancholy boughs , Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look 'd on better days , If ever been where bells have knoll 'd to church , If ever sat at any good man 's feast , If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what ' tis to pity and be pitied , Let gentleness my strong enforcement be : In the which hope I blush , and hide my sword .
DUKE SENIOR : True is it that we have seen better days , And have with holy bell been knoll 'd to church And sat at good men 's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engender 'd : And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be minister 'd .
ORLANDO : Then but forbear your food a little while , Whiles , like a doe , I go to find my fawn And give it food . There is an old poor man , Who after me hath many a weary step Limp 'd in pure love : till he be first sufficed , Oppress 'd with two weak evils , age and hunger , I will not touch a bit .
DUKE SENIOR : Go find him out , And we will nothing waste till you return .
ORLANDO : I thank ye ; and be blest for your good comfort ! Exit
DUKE SENIOR : Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy : This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in .
