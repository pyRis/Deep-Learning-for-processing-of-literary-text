CHARLES : I am heartily glad I came hither to you . If he come to-morrow , I 'll give him his payment : if ever he go alone again , I 'll never wrestle for prize more : and so God keep your worship !
OLIVER : Farewell , good Charles . Exit CHARLES Now will I stir this gamester : I hope I shall see an end of him ; for my soul , yet I know not why , hates nothing more than he . Yet he 's gentle , never schooled and yet learned , full of noble device , of all sorts enchantingly beloved , and indeed so much in the heart of the world , and especially of my own people , who best know him , that I am altogether misprised : but it shall not be so long ; this wrestler shall clear all : nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither ; which now I 'll go about . Exit Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
CELIA : I pray thee , Rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
ROSALIND : Dear Celia , I show more mirth than I am mistress of ; and would you yet I were merrier ? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
CELIA : Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee . If my uncle , thy banished father , had banished thy uncle , the duke my father , so thou hadst been still with me , I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine : so wouldst thou , if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee .
ROSALIND : Well , I will forget the condition of my estate , to rejoice in yours .
CELIA : You know my father hath no child but I , nor none is like to have : and , truly , when he dies , thou shalt be his heir , for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce , I will render thee again in affection ; by mine honour , I will ; and when I break that oath , let me turn monster : therefore , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be merry .
ROSALIND : From henceforth I will , coz , and devise sports . Let me see ; what think you of falling in love ?
CELIA : Marry , I prithee , do , to make sport withal : but love no man in good earnest ; nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again .
ROSALIND : What shall be our sport , then ?
CELIA : Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
ROSALIND : I would we could do so , for her benefits are mightily misplaced , and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women .
CELIA : ' Tis true ; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest , and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly .
ROSALIND : Nay , now thou goest from Fortune 's office to Nature 's : Fortune reigns in gifts of the world , not in the lineaments of Nature . Enter TOUCHSTONE
CELIA : No ? when Nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by Fortune fall into the fire ? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune , hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
ROSALIND : Indeed , there is Fortune too hard for Nature , when Fortune makes Nature 's natural the cutter-off of Nature 's wit .
CELIA : Peradventure this is not Fortune 's work neither , but Nature 's ; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone ; for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits . How now , wit ! whither wander you ?
TOUCHSTONE : Mistress , you must come away to your father .
CELIA : Were you made the messenger ?
