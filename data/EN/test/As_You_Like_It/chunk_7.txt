DUKE FREDERICK : She is too subtle for thee ; and her smoothness , Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people , and they pity her . Thou art a fool : she robs thee of thy name ; And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone . Then open not thy lips : Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have pass 'd upon her ; she is banish 'd .
CELIA : Pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege : I cannot live out of her company .
DUKE FREDERICK : You are a fool . You , niece , provide yourself : If you outstay the time , upon mine honour , And in the greatness of my word , you die .
CELIA : O my poor Rosalind , whither wilt thou go ? Wilt thou change fathers ? I will give thee mine . I charge thee , be not thou more grieved than I am .
ROSALIND : I have more cause .
CELIA : Thou hast not , cousin ; Prithee be cheerful : know 'st thou not , the duke Hath banish 'd me , his daughter ?
ROSALIND : That he hath not .
CELIA : No , hath not ? Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one : Shall we be sunder 'd ? shall we part , sweet girl ? No : let my father seek another heir . Therefore devise with me how we may fly , Whither to go and what to bear with us ; And do not seek to take your change upon you , To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out ; For , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , Say what thou canst , I 'll go along with thee .
ROSALIND : Why , whither shall we go ?
CELIA : To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden .
ROSALIND : Alas , what danger will it be to us , Maids as we are , to travel forth so far ! Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
CELIA : I 'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face ; The like do you : so shall we pass along And never stir assailants .
ROSALIND : Were it not better , Because that I am more than common tall , That I did suit me all points like a man ? A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh , A boar-spear in my hand ; and--in my heart Lie there what hidden woman 's fear there will-- We 'll have a swashing and a martial outside , As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances .
CELIA : What shall I call thee when thou art a man ?
ROSALIND : I 'll have no worse a name than Jove 's own page ; And therefore look you call me Ganymede . But what will you be call 'd ?
CELIA : Something that hath a reference to my state No longer Celia , but Aliena .
ROSALIND : But , cousin , what if we assay 'd to steal The clownish fool out of your father 's court ? Would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
CELIA : He 'll go along o 'er the wide world with me ; Leave me alone to woo him . Let 's away , And get our jewels and our wealth together , Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight . Now go we in content To liberty and not to banishment . Enter DUKE SENIOR , AMIENS , and two or three Lords , like foresters
DUKE SENIOR : Now , my co-mates and brothers in exile , Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp ? Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court ? Here feel we but the penalty of Adam , The seasons ' difference , as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winter 's wind , Which , when it bites and blows upon my body , Even till I shrink with cold , I smile and say ' This is no flattery : these are counsellors That feelingly persuade me what I am . ' Sweet are the uses of adversity , Which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , Wears yet a precious jewel in his head ; And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones and good in every thing . I would not change it .
