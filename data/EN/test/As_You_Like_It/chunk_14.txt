DUKE SENIOR : Welcome . Set down your venerable burthen , And let him feed .
ORLANDO : I thank you most for him .
ADAM : So had you need : I scarce can speak to thank you for myself .
DUKE SENIOR : Welcome ; fall to : I will not trouble you As yet , to question you about your fortunes . Give us some music ; and , good cousin , sing . SONG .
AMIENS : Blow , blow , thou winter wind . Thou art not so unkind As man 's ingratitude ; Thy tooth is not so keen , Because thou art not seen , Although thy breath be rude . Heigh-ho ! sing , heigh-ho ! unto the green holly : Most friendship is feigning , most loving mere folly : Then , heigh-ho , the holly ! This life is most jolly . Freeze , freeze , thou bitter sky , That dost not bite so nigh As benefits forgot : Though thou the waters warp , Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remember 'd not . Heigh-ho ! sing , & c .
DUKE SENIOR : If that you were the good Sir Rowland 's son , As you have whisper 'd faithfully you were , And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limn 'd and living in your face , Be truly welcome hither : I am the duke That loved your father : the residue of your fortune , Go to my cave and tell me . Good old man , Thou art right welcome as thy master is . Support him by the arm . Give me your hand , And let me all your fortunes understand . Enter DUKE FREDERICK , Lords , and OLIVER
DUKE FREDERICK : Not see him since ? Sir , sir , that cannot be : But were I not the better part made mercy , I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge , thou present . But look to it : Find out thy brother , wheresoe 'er he is ; Seek him with candle ; bring him dead or living Within this twelvemonth , or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory . Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure do we seize into our hands , Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth Of what we think against thee .
OLIVER : O that your highness knew my heart in this ! I never loved my brother in my life .
DUKE FREDERICK : More villain thou . Well , push him out of doors ; And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands : Do this expediently and turn him going . Enter ORLANDO , with a paper
ORLANDO : Hang there , my verse , in witness of my love : And thou , thrice-crowned queen of night , survey With thy chaste eye , from thy pale sphere above , Thy huntress ' name that my full life doth sway . O Rosalind ! these trees shall be my books And in their barks my thoughts I 'll character ; That every eye which in this forest looks Shall see thy virtue witness 'd every where . Run , run , Orlando ; carve on every tree The fair , the chaste and unexpressive she . Exit Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
CORIN : And how like you this shepherd 's life , Master Touchstone ?
TOUCHSTONE : Truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life , but in respect that it is a shepherd 's life , it is naught . In respect that it is solitary , I like it very well ; but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life . Now , in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious . As is it a spare life , look you , it fits my humour well ; but as there is no more plenty in it , it goes much against my stomach . Hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
