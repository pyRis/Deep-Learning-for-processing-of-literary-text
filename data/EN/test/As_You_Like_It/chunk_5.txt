DUKE FREDERICK : Bear him away . What is thy name , young man ?
ORLANDO : Orlando , my liege ; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
DUKE FREDERICK : I would thou hadst been son to some man else : The world esteem 'd thy father honourable , But I did find him still mine enemy : Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed , Hadst thou descended from another house . But fare thee well ; thou art a gallant youth : I would thou hadst told me of another father .
CELIA : Were I my father , coz , would I do this ?
ORLANDO : I am more proud to be Sir Rowland 's son , His youngest son ; and would not change that calling , To be adopted heir to Frederick .
ROSALIND : My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul , And all the world was of my father 's mind : Had I before known this young man his son , I should have given him tears unto entreaties , Ere he should thus have ventured .
CELIA : Gentle cousin , Let us go thank him and encourage him : My father 's rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart . Sir , you have well deserved : If you do keep your promises in love But justly , as you have exceeded all promise , Your mistress shall be happy .
ROSALIND : Gentleman , Giving him a chain from her neck Wear this for me , one out of suits with fortune , That could give more , but that her hand lacks means . Shall we go , coz ?
CELIA : Ay . Fare you well , fair gentleman .
ORLANDO : Can I not say , I thank you ? My better parts Are all thrown down , and that which here stands up Is but a quintain , a mere lifeless block .
ROSALIND : He calls us back : my pride fell with my fortunes ; I 'll ask him what he would . Did you call , sir ? Sir , you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemies .
CELIA : Will you go , coz ?
ROSALIND : Have with you . Fare you well .
ORLANDO : What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ? I cannot speak to her , yet she urged conference . O poor Orlando , thou art overthrown ! Or Charles or something weaker masters thee . Re-enter LE BEAU
LE BEAU : Good sir , I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place . Albeit you have deserved High commendation , true applause and love , Yet such is now the duke 's condition That he misconstrues all that you have done . The duke is humorous ; what he is indeed , More suits you to conceive than I to speak of .
ORLANDO : I thank you , sir : and , pray you , tell me this : Which of the two was daughter of the duke That here was at the wrestling ?
LE BEAU : Neither his daughter , if we judge by manners ; But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter The other is daughter to the banish 'd duke , And here detain 'd by her usurping uncle , To keep his daughter company ; whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters . But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta 'en displeasure ' gainst his gentle niece , Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father 's sake ; And , on my life , his malice ' gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth . Sir , fare you well : Hereafter , in a better world than this , I shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
ORLANDO : I rest much bounden to you : fare you well . Exit LE BEAU Thus must I from the smoke into the smother ; From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother : But heavenly Rosalind ! Exit Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
CELIA : Why , cousin ! why , Rosalind ! Cupid have mercy ! not a word ?
ROSALIND : Not one to throw at a dog .
