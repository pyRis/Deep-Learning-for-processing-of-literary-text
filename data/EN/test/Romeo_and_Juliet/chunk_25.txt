ROMEO : Let me be ta 'en , let me be put to death ; I am content , so thou wilt have it so . I 'll say yon grey is not the morning 's eye , ' Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia 's brow ; Nor that is not the lark , whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads : I have more care to stay than will to go : Come , death , and welcome ! Juliet wills it so . How is 't , my soul ? let 's talk ; it is not day .
JULIET : It is , it is : hie hence , be gone , away ! It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps . Some say the lark makes sweet division ; This doth not so , for she divideth us : Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes , O , now I would they had changed voices too ! Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray , Hunting thee hence with hunt 's-up to the day , O , now be gone ; more light and light it grows .
ROMEO : More light and light ; more dark and dark our woes ! Enter Nurse , to the chamber
Nurse : Madam !
JULIET : Nurse ?
Nurse : Your lady mother is coming to your chamber : The day is broke ; be wary , look about . Exit
JULIET : Then , window , let day in , and let life out .
ROMEO : Farewell , farewell ! one kiss , and I 'll descend . He goeth down
JULIET : Art thou gone so ? love , lord , ay , husband , friend ! I must hear from thee every day in the hour , For in a minute there are many days : O , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo !
ROMEO : Farewell ! I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
JULIET : O think 'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
ROMEO : I doubt it not ; and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come .
JULIET : O God , I have an ill-divining soul ! Methinks I see thee , now thou art below , As one dead in the bottom of a tomb : Either my eyesight fails , or thou look 'st pale .
ROMEO : And trust me , love , in my eye so do you : Dry sorrow drinks our blood . Adieu , adieu ! Exit
JULIET : O fortune , fortune ! all men call thee fickle : If thou art fickle , what dost thou with him . That is renown 'd for faith ? Be fickle , fortune ; For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .
LADY CAPULET : Ho , daughter ! are you up ?
JULIET : Who is 't that calls ? is it my lady mother ? Is she not down so late , or up so early ? What unaccustom 'd cause procures her hither ? Enter LADY CAPULET
LADY CAPULET : Why , how now , Juliet !
JULIET : Madam , I am not well .
LADY CAPULET : Evermore weeping for your cousin 's death ? What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ? An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live ; Therefore , have done : some grief shows much of love ; But much of grief shows still some want of wit .
JULIET : Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
LADY CAPULET : So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
JULIET : Feeling so the loss , Cannot choose but ever weep the friend .
LADY CAPULET : Well , girl , thou weep 'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughter 'd him .
JULIET : What villain madam ?
LADY CAPULET : That same villain , Romeo .
