ROMEO : Give me a torch : I am not for this ambling ; Being but heavy , I will bear the light .
MERCUTIO : Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
ROMEO : Not I , believe me : you have dancing shoes With nimble soles : I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move .
MERCUTIO : You are a lover ; borrow Cupid 's wings , And soar with them above a common bound .
ROMEO : I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe : Under love 's heavy burden do I sink .
MERCUTIO : And , to sink in it , should you burden love ; Too great oppression for a tender thing .
ROMEO : Is love a tender thing ? it is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
MERCUTIO : If love be rough with you , be rough with love ; Prick love for pricking , and you beat love down . Give me a case to put my visage in : A visor for a visor ! what care I What curious eye doth quote deformities ? Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me .
BENVOLIO : Come , knock and enter ; and no sooner in , But every man betake him to his legs .
ROMEO : A torch for me : let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels , For I am proverb 'd with a grandsire phrase ; I 'll be a candle-holder , and look on . The game was ne 'er so fair , and I am done .
MERCUTIO : Tut , dun 's the mouse , the constable 's own word : If thou art dun , we 'll draw thee from the mire Of this sir-reverence love , wherein thou stick 'st Up to the ears . Come , we burn daylight , ho !
ROMEO : Nay , that 's not so .
MERCUTIO : I mean , sir , in delay We waste our lights in vain , like lamps by day . Take our good meaning , for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits .
ROMEO : And we mean well in going to this mask ; But ' tis no wit to go .
MERCUTIO : Why , may one ask ?
ROMEO : I dream 'd a dream to-night .
MERCUTIO : And so did I.
ROMEO : Well , what was yours ?
MERCUTIO : That dreamers often lie .
ROMEO : In bed asleep , while they do dream things true .
