JULIET : Tell me not , friar , that thou hear 'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it : If , in thy wisdom , thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I 'll help it presently . God join 'd my heart and Romeo 's , thou our hands ; And ere this hand , by thee to Romeo seal 'd , Shall be the label to another deed , Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another , this shall slay them both : Therefore , out of thy long-experienced time , Give me some present counsel , or , behold , ' Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire , arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring . Be not so long to speak ; I long to die , If what thou speak 'st speak not of remedy .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold , daughter : I do spy a kind of hope , Which craves as desperate an execution . As that is desperate which we would prevent . If , rather than to marry County Paris , Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame , That copest with death himself to scape from it : And , if thou darest , I 'll give thee remedy .
JULIET : O , bid me leap , rather than marry Paris , From off the battlements of yonder tower ; Or walk in thievish ways ; or bid me lurk Where serpents are ; chain me with roaring bears ; Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house , O 'er-cover 'd quite with dead men 's rattling bones , With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls ; Or bid me go into a new-made grave And hide me with a dead man in his shroud ; Things that , to hear them told , have made me tremble ; And I will do it without fear or doubt , To live an unstain 'd wife to my sweet love .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold , then ; go home , be merry , give consent To marry Paris : Wednesday is to-morrow : To-morrow night look that thou lie alone ; Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber : Take thou this vial , being then in bed , And this distilled liquor drink thou off ; When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour , for no pulse Shall keep his native progress , but surcease : No warmth , no breath , shall testify thou livest ; The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes , thy eyes ' windows fall , Like death , when he shuts up the day of life ; Each part , deprived of supple government , Shall , stiff and stark and cold , appear like death : And in this borrow 'd likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours , And then awake as from a pleasant sleep . Now , when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead : Then , as the manner of our country is , In thy best robes uncover 'd on the bier Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie . In the mean time , against thou shalt awake , Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift , And hither shall he come : and he and I Will watch thy waking , and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua . And this shall free thee from this present shame ; If no inconstant toy , nor womanish fear , Abate thy valour in the acting it .
JULIET : Give me , give me ! O , tell not me of fear !
FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold ; get you gone , be strong and prosperous In this resolve : I 'll send a friar with speed To Mantua , with my letters to thy lord .
JULIET : Love give me strength ! and strength shall help afford . Farewell , dear father ! Enter CAPULET , LADY CAPULET , Nurse , and two Servingmen
CAPULET : So many guests invite as here are writ . Exit First Servant Sirrah , go hire me twenty cunning cooks .
Second Servant : You shall have none ill , sir ; for I 'll try if they can lick their fingers .
CAPULET : How canst thou try them so ?
Second Servant : Marry , sir , ' tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers : therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me .
CAPULET : Go , be gone . Exit Second Servant We shall be much unfurnished for this time . What , is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence ?
Nurse : Ay , forsooth .
CAPULET : Well , he may chance to do some good on her : A peevish self-will 'd harlotry it is .
Nurse : See where she comes from shrift with merry look . Enter JULIET
CAPULET : How now , my headstrong ! where have you been gadding ?
