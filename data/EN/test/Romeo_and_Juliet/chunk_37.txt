First Watchman : A great suspicion : stay the friar too . Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
PRINCE : What misadventure is so early up , That calls our person from our morning 's rest ? Enter CAPULET , LADY CAPULET , and others
CAPULET : What should it be , that they so shriek abroad ?
LADY CAPULET : The people in the street cry Romeo , Some Juliet , and some Paris ; and all run , With open outcry toward our monument .
PRINCE : What fear is this which startles in our ears ?
First Watchman : Sovereign , here lies the County Paris slain ; And Romeo dead ; and Juliet , dead before , Warm and new kill 'd .
PRINCE : Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
First Watchman : Here is a friar , and slaughter 'd Romeo 's man ; With instruments upon them , fit to open These dead men 's tombs .
CAPULET : O heavens ! O wife , look how our daughter bleeds ! This dagger hath mista 'en--for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , -- And it mis-sheathed in my daughter 's bosom !
LADY CAPULET : O me ! this sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulchre . Enter MONTAGUE and others
PRINCE : Come , Montague ; for thou art early up , To see thy son and heir more early down .
MONTAGUE : Alas , my liege , my wife is dead to-night ; Grief of my son 's exile hath stopp 'd her breath : What further woe conspires against mine age ?
PRINCE : Look , and thou shalt see .
MONTAGUE : O thou untaught ! what manners is in this ? To press before thy father to a grave ?
PRINCE : Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities , And know their spring , their head , their true descent ; And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death : meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience . Bring forth the parties of suspicion .
FRIAR LAURENCE : I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me of this direful murder ; And here I stand , both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excused .
PRINCE : Then say at once what thou dost know in this .
