BENVOLIO : Go , then ; for ' tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found . Enter ROMEO
ROMEO : He jests at scars that never felt a wound . JULIET appears above at a window But , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? It is the east , and Juliet is the sun . Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , Who is already sick and pale with grief , That thou her maid art far more fair than she : Be not her maid , since she is envious ; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it ; cast it off . It is my lady , O , it is my love ! O , that she knew she were ! She speaks yet she says nothing : what of that ? Her eye discourses ; I will answer it . I am too bold , ' tis not to me she speaks : Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return . What if her eyes were there , they in her head ? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars , As daylight doth a lamp ; her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night . See , how she leans her cheek upon her hand ! O , that I were a glove upon that hand , That I might touch that cheek !
JULIET : Ay me !
ROMEO : She speaks : O , speak again , bright angel ! for thou art As glorious to this night , being o 'er my head As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air .
JULIET : O Romeo , Romeo ! wherefore art thou Romeo ? Deny thy father and refuse thy name ; Or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , And I 'll no longer be a Capulet .
ROMEO : Shall I hear more , or shall I speak at this ?
JULIET : ' Tis but thy name that is my enemy ; Thou art thyself , though not a Montague . What 's Montague ? it is nor hand , nor foot , Nor arm , nor face , nor any other part Belonging to a man . O , be some other name ! What 's in a name ? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet ; So Romeo would , were he not Romeo call 'd , Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title . Romeo , doff thy name , And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself .
ROMEO : I take thee at thy word : Call me but love , and I 'll be new baptized ; Henceforth I never will be Romeo .
JULIET : What man art thou that thus bescreen 'd in night So stumblest on my counsel ?
ROMEO : By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am : My name , dear saint , is hateful to myself , Because it is an enemy to thee ; Had I it written , I would tear the word .
JULIET : My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue 's utterance , yet I know the sound : Art thou not Romeo and a Montague ?
ROMEO : Neither , fair saint , if either thee dislike .
JULIET : How camest thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .
ROMEO : With love 's light wings did I o 'er-perch these walls ; For stony limits cannot hold love out , And what love can do that dares love attempt ; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .
JULIET : If they do see thee , they will murder thee .
