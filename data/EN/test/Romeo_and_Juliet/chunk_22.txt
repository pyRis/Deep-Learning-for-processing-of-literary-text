Nurse : Weeping and wailing over Tybalt 's corse : Will you go to them ? I will bring you thither .
JULIET : Wash they his wounds with tears : mine shall be spent , When theirs are dry , for Romeo 's banishment . Take up those cords : poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I ; for Romeo is exiled : He made you for a highway to my bed ; But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed . Come , cords , come , nurse ; I 'll to my wedding-bed ; And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !
Nurse : Hie to your chamber : I 'll find Romeo To comfort you : I wot well where he is . Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night : I 'll to him ; he is hid at Laurence ' cell .
JULIET : O , find him ! give this ring to my true knight , And bid him come to take his last farewell . Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
FRIAR LAURENCE : Romeo , come forth ; come forth , thou fearful man : Affliction is enamour 'd of thy parts , And thou art wedded to calamity . Enter ROMEO
ROMEO : Father , what news ? what is the prince 's doom ? What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand , That I yet know not ?
FRIAR LAURENCE : Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company : I bring thee tidings of the prince 's doom .
ROMEO : What less than dooms-day is the prince 's doom ?
FRIAR LAURENCE : A gentler judgment vanish 'd from his lips , Not body 's death , but body 's banishment .
ROMEO : Ha , banishment ! be merciful , say ' death ; ' For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death : do not say ' banishment . ' 
FRIAR LAURENCE : Hence from Verona art thou banished : Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
ROMEO : There is no world without Verona walls , But purgatory , torture , hell itself . Hence-banished is banish 'd from the world , And world 's exile is death : then banished , Is death mis-term 'd : calling death banishment , Thou cutt 'st my head off with a golden axe , And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
FRIAR LAURENCE : O deadly sin ! O rude unthankfulness ! Thy fault our law calls death ; but the kind prince , Taking thy part , hath rush 'd aside the law , And turn 'd that black word death to banishment : This is dear mercy , and thou seest it not .
ROMEO : ' Tis torture , and not mercy : heaven is here , Where Juliet lives ; and every cat and dog And little mouse , every unworthy thing , Live here in heaven and may look on her ; But Romeo may not : more validity , More honourable state , more courtship lives In carrion-flies than Romeo : they my seize On the white wonder of dear Juliet 's hand And steal immortal blessing from her lips , Who even in pure and vestal modesty , Still blush , as thinking their own kisses sin ; But Romeo may not ; he is banished : Flies may do this , but I from this must fly : They are free men , but I am banished . And say 'st thou yet that exile is not death ? Hadst thou no poison mix 'd , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne 'er so mean , But ' banished ' to kill me ? -- ' banished ' ? O friar , the damned use that word in hell ; Howlings attend it : how hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend profess 'd , To mangle me with that word ' banished ' ?
FRIAR LAURENCE : Thou fond mad man , hear me but speak a word .
ROMEO : O , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
FRIAR LAURENCE : I 'll give thee armour to keep off that word : Adversity 's sweet milk , philosophy , To comfort thee , though thou art banished .
