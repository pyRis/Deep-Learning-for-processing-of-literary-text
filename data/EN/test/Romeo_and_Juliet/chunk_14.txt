BENVOLIO : The what ?
MERCUTIO : The pox of such antic , lisping , affecting fantasticoes ; these new tuners of accents ! ' By Jesu , a very good blade ! a very tall man ! a very good whore ! ' Why , is not this a lamentable thing , grandsire , that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies , these fashion-mongers , these perdona-mi 's , who stand so much on the new form , that they cannot at ease on the old bench ? O , their bones , their bones ! Enter ROMEO
BENVOLIO : Here comes Romeo , here comes Romeo .
MERCUTIO : Without his roe , like a dried herring : flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified ! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in : Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench ; marry , she had a better love to be-rhyme her ; Dido a dowdy ; Cleopatra a gipsy ; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots ; Thisbe a grey eye or so , but not to the purpose . Signior Romeo , bon jour ! there 's a French salutation to your French slop . You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
ROMEO : Good morrow to you both . What counterfeit did I give you ?
MERCUTIO : The ship , sir , the slip ; can you not conceive ?
ROMEO : Pardon , good Mercutio , my business was great ; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .
MERCUTIO : That 's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .
ROMEO : Meaning , to court 'sy .
MERCUTIO : Thou hast most kindly hit it .
ROMEO : A most courteous exposition .
MERCUTIO : Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .
ROMEO : Pink for flower .
MERCUTIO : Right .
ROMEO : Why , then is my pump well flowered .
MERCUTIO : Well said : follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump , that when the single sole of it is worn , the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular .
ROMEO : O single-soled jest , solely singular for the singleness .
MERCUTIO : Come between us , good Benvolio ; my wits faint .
ROMEO : Switch and spurs , switch and spurs ; or I 'll cry a match .
MERCUTIO : Nay , if thy wits run the wild-goose chase , I have done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five : was I with you there for the goose ?
ROMEO : Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast not there for the goose .
MERCUTIO : I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
ROMEO : Nay , good goose , bite not .
MERCUTIO : Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting ; it is a most sharp sauce .
ROMEO : And is it not well served in to a sweet goose ?
MERCUTIO : O here 's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
ROMEO : I stretch it out for that word ' broad ; ' which added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
MERCUTIO : Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ? now art thou sociable , now art thou Romeo ; now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature : for this drivelling love is like a great natural , that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole .
BENVOLIO : Stop there , stop there .
MERCUTIO : Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair .
BENVOLIO : Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
MERCUTIO : O , thou art deceived ; I would have made it short : for I was come to the whole depth of my tale ; and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .
ROMEO : Here 's goodly gear ! Enter Nurse and PETER
MERCUTIO : A sail , a sail !
