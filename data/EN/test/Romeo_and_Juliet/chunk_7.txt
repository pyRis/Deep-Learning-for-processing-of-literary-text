MERCUTIO : O , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you . She is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman , Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart men 's noses as they lie asleep ; Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders ' legs , The cover of the wings of grasshoppers , The traces of the smallest spider 's web , The collars of the moonshine 's watery beams , Her whip of cricket 's bone , the lash of film , Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat , Not so big as a round little worm Prick 'd from the lazy finger of a maid ; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub , Time out o ' mind the fairies ' coachmakers . And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love ; O 'er courtiers ' knees , that dream on court 'sies straight , O 'er lawyers ' fingers , who straight dream on fees , O 'er ladies ' lips , who straight on kisses dream , Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues , Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are : Sometime she gallops o 'er a courtier 's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit ; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig 's tail Tickling a parson 's nose as a ' lies asleep , Then dreams , he of another benefice : Sometime she driveth o 'er a soldier 's neck , And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , Of breaches , ambuscadoes , Spanish blades , Of healths five-fathom deep ; and then anon Drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes , And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again . This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night , And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs , Which once untangled , much misfortune bodes : This is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , That presses them and learns them first to bear , Making them women of good carriage : This is she--
ROMEO : Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace ! Thou talk 'st of nothing .
MERCUTIO : True , I talk of dreams , Which are the children of an idle brain , Begot of nothing but vain fantasy , Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind , who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north , And , being anger 'd , puffs away from thence , Turning his face to the dew-dropping south .
BENVOLIO : This wind , you talk of , blows us from ourselves ; Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
ROMEO : I fear , too early : for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night 's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death . But He , that hath the steerage of my course , Direct my sail ! On , lusty gentlemen .
BENVOLIO : Strike , drum . Musicians waiting . Enter Servingmen with napkins
First Servant : Where 's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ? He shift a trencher ? he scrape a trencher !
Second Servant : When good manners shall lie all in one or two men 's hands and they unwashed too , ' tis a foul thing .
First Servant : Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate . Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane ; and , as thou lovest me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell . Antony , and Potpan !
Second Servant : Ay , boy , ready .
First Servant : You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
Second Servant : We cannot be here and there too . Cheerly , boys ; be brisk awhile , and the longer liver take all . Enter CAPULET , with JULIET and others of his house , meeting the Guests and Maskers
CAPULET : Welcome , gentlemen ! ladies that have their toes Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you . Ah ha , my mistresses ! which of you all Will now deny to dance ? she that makes dainty , She , I 'll swear , hath corns ; am I come near ye now ? Welcome , gentlemen ! I have seen the day That I have worn a visor and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady 's ear , Such as would please : ' tis gone , ' tis gone , ' tis gone : You are welcome , gentlemen ! come , musicians , play . A hall , a hall ! give room ! and foot it , girls . Music plays , and they dance More light , you knaves ; and turn the tables up , And quench the fire , the room is grown too hot . Ah , sirrah , this unlook 'd-for sport comes well . Nay , sit , nay , sit , good cousin Capulet ; For you and I are past our dancing days : How long is 't now since last yourself and I Were in a mask ?
Second Capulet : By 'r lady , thirty years .
CAPULET : What , man ! ' tis not so much , ' tis not so much : ' Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio , Come pentecost as quickly as it will , Some five and twenty years ; and then we mask 'd .
Second Capulet : ' Tis more , ' tis more , his son is elder , sir ; His son is thirty .
CAPULET : Will you tell me that ? His son was but a ward two years ago .
ROMEO : What lady is that , which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight ?
Servant : I know not , sir .
