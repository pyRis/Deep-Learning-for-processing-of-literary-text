LADY CAPULET : Fie , fie ! what , are you mad ?
JULIET : Good father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .
CAPULET : Hang thee , young baggage ! disobedient wretch ! I tell thee what : get thee to church o ' Thursday , Or never after look me in the face : Speak not , reply not , do not answer me ; My fingers itch . Wife , we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child ; But now I see this one is one too much , And that we have a curse in having her : Out on her , hilding !
Nurse : God in heaven bless her ! You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
CAPULET : And why , my lady wisdom ? hold your tongue , Good prudence ; smatter with your gossips , go .
Nurse : I speak no treason .
CAPULET : O , God ye god-den .
Nurse : May not one speak ?
CAPULET : Peace , you mumbling fool ! Utter your gravity o 'er a gossip 's bowl ; For here we need it not .
LADY CAPULET : You are too hot .
CAPULET : God 's bread ! it makes me mad : Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , Alone , in company , still my care hath been To have her match 'd : and having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage , Of fair demesnes , youthful , and nobly train 'd , Stuff 'd , as they say , with honourable parts , Proportion 'd as one 's thought would wish a man ; And then to have a wretched puling fool , A whining mammet , in her fortune 's tender , To answer ' I 'll not wed ; I cannot love , I am too young ; I pray you , pardon me . ' But , as you will not wed , I 'll pardon you : Graze where you will you shall not house with me : Look to 't , think on 't , I do not use to jest . Thursday is near ; lay hand on heart , advise : An you be mine , I 'll give you to my friend ; And you be not , hang , beg , starve , die in the streets , For , by my soul , I 'll ne 'er acknowledge thee , Nor what is mine shall never do thee good : Trust to 't , bethink you ; I 'll not be forsworn . Exit
JULIET : Is there no pity sitting in the clouds , That sees into the bottom of my grief ? O , sweet my mother , cast me not away ! Delay this marriage for a month , a week ; Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .
LADY CAPULET : Talk not to me , for I 'll not speak a word : Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee . Exit
JULIET : O God ! --O nurse , how shall this be prevented ? My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven ; How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth ? comfort me , counsel me . Alack , alack , that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself ! What say 'st thou ? hast thou not a word of joy ? Some comfort , nurse .
