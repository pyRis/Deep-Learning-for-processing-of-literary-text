CAPULET : What noise is this ? Give me my long sword , ho !
LADY CAPULET : A crutch , a crutch ! why call you for a sword ?
CAPULET : My sword , I say ! Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me . Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
MONTAGUE : Thou villain Capulet , --Hold me not , let me go .
LADY MONTAGUE : Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe . Enter PRINCE , with Attendants
PRINCE : Rebellious subjects , enemies to peace , Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel , -- Will they not hear ? What , ho ! you men , you beasts , That quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins , On pain of torture , from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper 'd weapons to the ground , And hear the sentence of your moved prince . Three civil brawls , bred of an airy word , By thee , old Capulet , and Montague , Have thrice disturb 'd the quiet of our streets , And made Verona 's ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments , To wield old partisans , in hands as old , Canker 'd with peace , to part your canker 'd hate : If ever you disturb our streets again , Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace . For this time , all the rest depart away : You Capulet ; shall go along with me : And , Montague , come you this afternoon , To know our further pleasure in this case , To old Free-town , our common judgment-place . Once more , on pain of death , all men depart .
MONTAGUE : Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach ? Speak , nephew , were you by when it began ?
BENVOLIO : Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach : I drew to part them : in the instant came The fiery Tybalt , with his sword prepared , Which , as he breathed defiance to my ears , He swung about his head and cut the winds , Who nothing hurt withal hiss 'd him in scorn : While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the prince came , who parted either part .
LADY MONTAGUE : O , where is Romeo ? saw you him to-day ? Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
BENVOLIO : Madam , an hour before the worshipp 'd sun Peer 'd forth the golden window of the east , A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad ; Where , underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city 's side , So early walking did I see your son : Towards him I made , but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood : I , measuring his affections by my own , That most are busied when they 're most alone , Pursued my humour not pursuing his , And gladly shunn 'd who gladly fled from me .
MONTAGUE : Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew . Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs ; But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora 's bed , Away from the light steals home my heavy son , And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks far daylight out And makes himself an artificial night : Black and portentous must this humour prove , Unless good counsel may the cause remove .
BENVOLIO : My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
MONTAGUE : I neither know it nor can learn of him .
BENVOLIO : Have you importuned him by any means ?
