Nurse : Madam !
JULIET : I come , anon.--But if thou mean 'st not well , I do beseech thee--
Nurse : Madam !
JULIET : By and by , I come : -- To cease thy suit , and leave me to my grief : To-morrow will I send .
ROMEO : So thrive my soul--
JULIET : A thousand times good night ! Exit , above
ROMEO : A thousand times the worse , to want thy light . Love goes toward love , as schoolboys from their books , But love from love , toward school with heavy looks . Retiring Re-enter JULIET , above
JULIET : Hist ! Romeo , hist ! O , for a falconer 's voice , To lure this tassel-gentle back again ! Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud ; Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of my Romeo 's name .
ROMEO : It is my soul that calls upon my name : How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears !
JULIET : Romeo !
ROMEO : My dear ?
JULIET : At what o 'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee ?
ROMEO : At the hour of nine .
JULIET : I will not fail : ' tis twenty years till then . I have forgot why I did call thee back .
ROMEO : Let me stand here till thou remember it .
JULIET : I shall forget , to have thee still stand there , Remembering how I love thy company .
ROMEO : And I 'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
JULIET : ' Tis almost morning ; I would have thee gone : And yet no further than a wanton 's bird ; Who lets it hop a little from her hand , Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silk thread plucks it back again , So loving-jealous of his liberty .
ROMEO : I would I were thy bird .
JULIET : Sweet , so would I : Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing . Good night , good night ! parting is such sweet sorrow , That I shall say good night till it be morrow . Exit above
ROMEO : Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast ! Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest ! Hence will I to my ghostly father 's cell , His help to crave , and my dear hap to tell . Exit Enter FRIAR LAURENCE , with a basket
FRIAR LAURENCE : The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day 's path and Titan 's fiery wheels : Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night 's dank dew to dry , I must up-fill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers . The earth that 's nature 's mother is her tomb ; What is her burying grave that is her womb , And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different . O , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities : For nought so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give , Nor aught so good but strain 'd from that fair use Revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse : Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied ; And vice sometimes by action dignified . Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power : For this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part ; Being tasted , slays all senses with the heart . Two such opposed kings encamp them still In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will ; And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant . Enter ROMEO
ROMEO : Good morrow , father .
