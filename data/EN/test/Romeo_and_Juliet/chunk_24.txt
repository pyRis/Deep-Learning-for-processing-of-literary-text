FRIAR LAURENCE : Hold thy desperate hand : Art thou a man ? thy form cries out thou art : Thy tears are womanish ; thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast : Unseemly woman in a seeming man ! Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both ! Thou hast amazed me : by my holy order , I thought thy disposition better temper 'd . Hast thou slain Tybalt ? wilt thou slay thyself ? And stay thy lady too that lives in thee , By doing damned hate upon thyself ? Why rail 'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ? Since birth , and heaven , and earth , all three do meet In thee at once ; which thou at once wouldst lose . Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit ; Which , like a usurer , abound 'st in all , And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit : Thy noble shape is but a form of wax , Digressing from the valour of a man ; Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury , Killing that love which thou hast vow 'd to cherish ; Thy wit , that ornament to shape and love , Misshapen in the conduct of them both , Like powder in a skitless soldier 's flask , Is set afire by thine own ignorance , And thou dismember 'd with thine own defence . What , rouse thee , man ! thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead ; There art thou happy : Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew 'st Tybalt ; there are thou happy too : The law that threaten 'd death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile ; there art thou happy : A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back ; Happiness courts thee in her best array ; But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout 'st upon thy fortune and thy love : Take heed , take heed , for such die miserable . Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed , Ascend her chamber , hence and comfort her : But look thou stay not till the watch be set , For then thou canst not pass to Mantua ; Where thou shalt live , till we can find a time To blaze your marriage , reconcile your friends , Beg pardon of the prince , and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went 'st forth in lamentation . Go before , nurse : commend me to thy lady ; And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto : Romeo is coming .
Nurse : O Lord , I could have stay 'd here all the night To hear good counsel : O , what learning is ! My lord , I 'll tell my lady you will come .
ROMEO : Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
Nurse : Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir : Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late . Exit
ROMEO : How well my comfort is revived by this !
FRIAR LAURENCE : Go hence ; good night ; and here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence : Sojourn in Mantua ; I 'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here : Give me thy hand ; ' tis late : farewell ; good night .
ROMEO : But that a joy past joy calls out on me , It were a grief , so brief to part with thee : Farewell . Enter CAPULET , LADY CAPULET , and PARIS
CAPULET : Things have fall 'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter : Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I : --Well , we were born to die . ' Tis very late , she 'll not come down to-night : I promise you , but for your company , I would have been a-bed an hour ago .
PARIS : These times of woe afford no time to woo . Madam , good night : commend me to your daughter .
LADY CAPULET : I will , and know her mind early to-morrow ; To-night she is mew 'd up to her heaviness .
CAPULET : Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child 's love : I think she will be ruled In all respects by me ; nay , more , I doubt it not . Wife , go you to her ere you go to bed ; Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love ; And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next-- But , soft ! what day is this ?
PARIS : Monday , my lord ,
CAPULET : Monday ! ha , ha ! Well , Wednesday is too soon , O ' Thursday let it be : o ' Thursday , tell her , She shall be married to this noble earl . Will you be ready ? do you like this haste ? We 'll keep no great ado , --a friend or two ; For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much : Therefore we 'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end . But what say you to Thursday ?
PARIS : My lord , I would that Thursday were to-morrow .
CAPULET : Well get you gone : o ' Thursday be it , then . Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed , Prepare her , wife , against this wedding-day . Farewell , my lord . Light to my chamber , ho ! Afore me ! it is so very very late , That we may call it early by and by . Good night . Enter ROMEO and JULIET above , at the window
JULIET : Wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day : It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear ; Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree : Believe me , love , it was the nightingale .
ROMEO : It was the lark , the herald of the morn , No nightingale : look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east : Night 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . I must be gone and live , or stay and die .
