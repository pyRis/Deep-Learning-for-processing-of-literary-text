Nurse : I will tell her , sir , that you do protest ; which , as I take it , is a gentlemanlike offer .
ROMEO : Bid her devise Some means to come to shrift this afternoon ; And there she shall at Friar Laurence ' cell Be shrived and married . Here is for thy pains .
Nurse : No truly sir ; not a penny .
ROMEO : Go to ; I say you shall .
Nurse : This afternoon , sir ? well , she shall be there .
ROMEO : And stay , good nurse , behind the abbey wall : Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair ; Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night . Farewell ; be trusty , and I 'll quit thy pains : Farewell ; commend me to thy mistress .
Nurse : Now God in heaven bless thee ! Hark you , sir .
ROMEO : What say 'st thou , my dear nurse ?
Nurse : Is your man secret ? Did you ne 'er hear say , Two may keep counsel , putting one away ?
ROMEO : I warrant thee , my man 's as true as steel .
NURSE : Well , sir ; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord , Lord ! when ' twas a little prating thing : --O , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard ; but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him . I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man ; but , I 'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world . Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter ?
ROMEO : Ay , nurse ; what of that ? both with an R.
Nurse : Ah. mocker ! that 's the dog 's name ; R is for the--No ; I know it begins with some other letter : --and she hath the prettiest sententious of it , of you and rosemary , that it would do you good to hear it .
ROMEO : Commend me to thy lady .
Nurse : Ay , a thousand times . Exit Romeo Peter !
PETER : Anon !
Nurse : Peter , take my fan , and go before and apace . Enter JULIET
JULIET : The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse ; In half an hour she promised to return . Perchance she cannot meet him : that 's not so . O , she is lame ! love 's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun 's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills : Therefore do nimble-pinion 'd doves draw love , And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings . Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day 's journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come . Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball ; My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me : But old folks , many feign as they were dead ; Unwieldy , slow , heavy and pale as lead . O God , she comes ! Enter Nurse and PETER O honey nurse , what news ? Hast thou met with him ? Send thy man away .
Nurse : Peter , stay at the gate . Exit PETER
JULIET : Now , good sweet nurse , --O Lord , why look 'st thou sad ? Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily ; If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .
Nurse : I am a-weary , give me leave awhile : Fie , how my bones ache ! what a jaunt have I had !
JULIET : I would thou hadst my bones , and I thy news : Nay , come , I pray thee , speak ; good , good nurse , speak .
Nurse : Jesu , what haste ? can you not stay awhile ? Do you not see that I am out of breath ?
