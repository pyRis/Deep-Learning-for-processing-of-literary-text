FRIAR LAURENCE : Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
CAPULET : Ready to go , but never to return . O son ! the night before thy wedding-day Hath Death lain with thy wife . There she lies , Flower as she was , deflowered by him . Death is my son-in-law , Death is my heir ; My daughter he hath wedded : I will die , And leave him all ; life , living , all is Death 's .
PARIS : Have I thought long to see this morning 's face , And doth it give me such a sight as this ?
LADY CAPULET : Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day ! Most miserable hour that e 'er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage ! But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catch 'd it from my sight !
Nurse : O woe ! O woful , woful , woful day ! Most lamentable day , most woful day , That ever , ever , I did yet behold ! O day ! O day ! O day ! O hateful day ! Never was seen so black a day as this : O woful day , O woful day !
PARIS : Beguiled , divorced , wronged , spited , slain ! Most detestable death , by thee beguil 'd , By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown ! O love ! O life ! not life , but love in death !
CAPULET : Despised , distressed , hated , martyr 'd , kill 'd ! Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity ? O child ! O child ! my soul , and not my child ! Dead art thou ! Alack ! my child is dead ; And with my child my joys are buried .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Peace , ho , for shame ! confusion 's cure lives not In these confusions . Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid ; now heaven hath all , And all the better is it for the maid : Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life . The most you sought was her promotion ; For ' twas your heaven she should be advanced : And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ? O , in this love , you love your child so ill , That you run mad , seeing that she is well : She 's not well married that lives married long ; But she 's best married that dies married young . Dry up your tears , and stick your rosemary On this fair corse ; and , as the custom is , In all her best array bear her to church : For though fond nature bids us an lament , Yet nature 's tears are reason 's merriment .
CAPULET : All things that we ordained festival , Turn from their office to black funeral ; Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast , Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Sir , go you in ; and , madam , go with him ; And go , Sir Paris ; every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave : The heavens do lour upon you for some ill ; Move them no more by crossing their high will .
First Musician : Faith , we may put up our pipes , and be gone .
Nurse : Honest goodfellows , ah , put up , put up ; For , well you know , this is a pitiful case . Exit
First Musician : Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended . Enter PETER
PETER : Musicians , O , musicians , ' Heart 's ease , Heart 's ease : ' O , an you will have me live , play ' Heart 's ease . ' 
First Musician : Why ' Heart 's ease ? '
