Nurse : Ay , ay , the cords . Throws them down
JULIET : Ay me ! what news ? why dost thou wring thy hands ?
Nurse : Ah , well-a-day ! he 's dead , he 's dead , he 's dead ! We are undone , lady , we are undone ! Alack the day ! he 's gone , he 's kill 'd , he 's dead !
JULIET : Can heaven be so envious ?
Nurse : Romeo can , Though heaven cannot : O Romeo , Romeo ! Who ever would have thought it ? Romeo !
JULIET : What devil art thou , that dost torment me thus ? This torture should be roar 'd in dismal hell . Hath Romeo slain himself ? say thou but ' I , ' And that bare vowel ' I ' shall poison more Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice : I am not I , if there be such an I ; Or those eyes shut , that make thee answer ' I. ' If he be slain , say ' I ' ; or if not , no : Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
Nurse : I saw the wound , I saw it with mine eyes , -- God save the mark ! --here on his manly breast : A piteous corse , a bloody piteous corse ; Pale , pale as ashes , all bedaub 'd in blood , All in gore-blood ; I swounded at the sight .
JULIET : O , break , my heart ! poor bankrupt , break at once ! To prison , eyes , ne 'er look on liberty ! Vile earth , to earth resign ; end motion here ; And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier !
Nurse : O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had ! O courteous Tybalt ! honest gentleman ! That ever I should live to see thee dead !
JULIET : What storm is this that blows so contrary ? Is Romeo slaughter 'd , and is Tybalt dead ? My dear-loved cousin , and my dearer lord ? Then , dreadful trumpet , sound the general doom ! For who is living , if those two are gone ?
Nurse : Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished ; Romeo that kill 'd him , he is banished .
JULIET : O God ! did Romeo 's hand shed Tybalt 's blood ?
Nurse : It did , it did ; alas the day , it did !
JULIET : O serpent heart , hid with a flowering face ! Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ? Beautiful tyrant ! fiend angelical ! Dove-feather 'd raven ! wolvish-ravening lamb ! Despised substance of divinest show ! Just opposite to what thou justly seem 'st , A damned saint , an honourable villain ! O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell , When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ? Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ? O that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace !
Nurse : There 's no trust , No faith , no honesty in men ; all perjured , All forsworn , all naught , all dissemblers . Ah , where 's my man ? give me some aqua vitae : These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old . Shame come to Romeo !
JULIET : Blister 'd be thy tongue For such a wish ! he was not born to shame : Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit ; For ' tis a throne where honour may be crown 'd Sole monarch of the universal earth . O , what a beast was I to chide at him !
Nurse : Will you speak well of him that kill 'd your cousin ?
