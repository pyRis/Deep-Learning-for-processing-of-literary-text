BENVOLIO : See , where he comes : so please you , step aside ; I 'll know his grievance , or be much denied .
MONTAGUE : I would thou wert so happy by thy stay , To hear true shrift . Come , madam , let 's away .
BENVOLIO : Good-morrow , cousin .
ROMEO : Is the day so young ?
BENVOLIO : But new struck nine .
ROMEO : Ay me ! sad hours seem long . Was that my father that went hence so fast ?
BENVOLIO : It was . What sadness lengthens Romeo 's hours ?
ROMEO : Not having that , which , having , makes them short .
BENVOLIO : In love ?
ROMEO : Out--
BENVOLIO : Of love ?
ROMEO : Out of her favour , where I am in love .
BENVOLIO : Alas , that love , so gentle in his view , Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof !
ROMEO : Alas , that love , whose view is muffled still , Should , without eyes , see pathways to his will ! Where shall we dine ? O me ! What fray was here ? Yet tell me not , for I have heard it all . Here 's much to do with hate , but more with love . Why , then , O brawling love ! O loving hate ! O any thing , of nothing first create ! O heavy lightness ! serious vanity ! Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms ! Feather of lead , bright smoke , cold fire , sick health ! Still-waking sleep , that is not what it is ! This love feel I , that feel no love in this . Dost thou not laugh ?
BENVOLIO : No , coz , I rather weep .
ROMEO : Good heart , at what ?
BENVOLIO : At thy good heart 's oppression .
ROMEO : Why , such is love 's transgression . Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast , Which thou wilt propagate , to have it prest With more of thine : this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own . Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs ; Being purged , a fire sparkling in lovers ' eyes ; Being vex 'd a sea nourish 'd with lovers ' tears : What is it else ? a madness most discreet , A choking gall and a preserving sweet . Farewell , my coz .
BENVOLIO : Soft ! I will go along ; An if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
ROMEO : Tut , I have lost myself ; I am not here ; This is not Romeo , he 's some other where .
BENVOLIO : Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
ROMEO : What , shall I groan and tell thee ?
BENVOLIO : Groan ! why , no . But sadly tell me who .
ROMEO : Bid a sick man in sadness make his will : Ah , word ill urged to one that is so ill ! In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
BENVOLIO : I aim 'd so near , when I supposed you loved .
ROMEO : A right good mark-man ! And she 's fair I love .
BENVOLIO : A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
ROMEO : Well , in that hit you miss : she 'll not be hit With Cupid 's arrow ; she hath Dian 's wit ; And , in strong proof of chastity well arm 'd , From love 's weak childish bow she lives unharm 'd . She will not stay the siege of loving terms , Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes , Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold : O , she is rich in beauty , only poor , That when she dies with beauty dies her store .
BENVOLIO : Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?
