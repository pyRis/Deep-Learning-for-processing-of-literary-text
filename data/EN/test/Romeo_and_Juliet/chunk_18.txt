ROMEO : Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heap 'd like mine and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbour air , and let rich music 's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .
JULIET : Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament : They are but beggars that can count their worth ; But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Come , come with me , and we will make short work ; For , by your leaves , you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one . Enter MERCUTIO , BENVOLIO , Page , and Servants
BENVOLIO : I pray thee , good Mercutio , let 's retire : The day is hot , the Capulets abroad , And , if we meet , we shall not scape a brawl ; For now , these hot days , is the mad blood stirring .
MERCUTIO : Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says ' God send me no need of thee ! ' and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .
BENVOLIO : Am I like such a fellow ?
MERCUTIO : Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
BENVOLIO : And what to ?
MERCUTIO : Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other . Thou ! why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more , or a hair less , in his beard , than thou hast : thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes : what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ? Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling : thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street , because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun : didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ? with another , for tying his new shoes with old riband ? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling !
BENVOLIO : An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
MERCUTIO : The fee-simple ! O simple !
BENVOLIO : By my head , here come the Capulets .
MERCUTIO : By my heel , I care not . Enter TYBALT and others
TYBALT : Follow me close , for I will speak to them . Gentlemen , good den : a word with one of you .
MERCUTIO : And but one word with one of us ? couple it with something ; make it a word and a blow .
TYBALT : You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
MERCUTIO : Could you not take some occasion without giving ?
TYBALT : Mercutio , thou consort 'st with Romeo , --
MERCUTIO : Consort ! what , dost thou make us minstrels ? an thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords : here 's my fiddlestick ; here 's that shall make you dance . ' Zounds , consort !
BENVOLIO : We talk here in the public haunt of men : Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart ; here all eyes gaze on us .
MERCUTIO : Men 's eyes were made to look , and let them gaze ; I will not budge for no man 's pleasure , I. Enter ROMEO
TYBALT : Well , peace be with you , sir : here comes my man .
MERCUTIO : But I 'll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery : Marry , go before to field , he 'll be your follower ; Your worship in that sense may call him ' man . '
