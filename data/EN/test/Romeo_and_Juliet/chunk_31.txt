JULIET : Farewell ! God knows when we shall meet again . I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins , That almost freezes up the heat of life : I 'll call them back again to comfort me : Nurse ! What should she do here ? My dismal scene I needs must act alone . Come , vial . What if this mixture do not work at all ? Shall I be married then to-morrow morning ? No , no : this shall forbid it : lie thou there . Laying down her dagger What if it be a poison , which the friar Subtly hath minister 'd to have me dead , Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour 'd , Because he married me before to Romeo ? I fear it is : and yet , methinks , it should not , For he hath still been tried a holy man . How if , when I am laid into the tomb , I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me ? there 's a fearful point ! Shall I not , then , be stifled in the vault , To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in , And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes ? Or , if I live , is it not very like , The horrible conceit of death and night , Together with the terror of the place , -- As in a vault , an ancient receptacle , Where , for these many hundred years , the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed : Where bloody Tybalt , yet but green in earth , Lies festering in his shroud ; where , as they say , At some hours in the night spirits resort ; -- Alack , alack , is it not like that I , So early waking , what with loathsome smells , And shrieks like mandrakes ' torn out of the earth , That living mortals , hearing them , run mad : -- O , if I wake , shall I not be distraught , Environed with all these hideous fears ? And madly play with my forefather 's joints ? And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud ? And , in this rage , with some great kinsman 's bone , As with a club , dash out my desperate brains ? O , look ! methinks I see my cousin 's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier 's point : stay , Tybalt , stay ! Romeo , I come ! this do I drink to thee .

Nurse : O lamentable day !
LADY CAPULET : O woful time !
