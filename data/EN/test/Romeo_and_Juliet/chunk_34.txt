ROMEO : No matter : get thee gone , And hire those horses ; I 'll be with thee straight . Exit BALTHASAR Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee to-night . Let 's see for means : O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men ! I do remember an apothecary , -- And hereabouts he dwells , --which late I noted In tatter 'd weeds , with overwhelming brows , Culling of simples ; meagre were his looks , Sharp misery had worn him to the bones : And in his needy shop a tortoise hung , An alligator stuff 'd , and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes ; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes , Green earthen pots , bladders and musty seeds , Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses , Were thinly scatter 'd , to make up a show . Noting this penury , to myself I said ' An if a man did need a poison now , Whose sale is present death in Mantua , Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him . ' O , this same thought did but forerun my need ; And this same needy man must sell it me . As I remember , this should be the house . Being holiday , the beggar 's shop is shut . What , ho ! apothecary ! Enter Apothecary
Apothecary : Who calls so loud ?
ROMEO : Come hither , man . I see that thou art poor : Hold , there is forty ducats : let me have A dram of poison , such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead And that the trunk may be discharged of breath As violently as hasty powder fired Doth hurry from the fatal cannon 's womb .
Apothecary : Such mortal drugs I have ; but Mantua 's law Is death to any he that utters them .
ROMEO : Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear 'st to die ? famine is in thy cheeks , Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes , Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back ; The world is not thy friend nor the world 's law ; The world affords no law to make thee rich ; Then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
Apothecary : My poverty , but not my will , consents .
ROMEO : I pay thy poverty , and not thy will .
Apothecary : Put this in any liquid thing you will , And drink it off ; and , if you had the strength Of twenty men , it would dispatch you straight .
ROMEO : There is thy gold , worse poison to men 's souls , Doing more murders in this loathsome world , Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell . I sell thee poison ; thou hast sold me none . Farewell : buy food , and get thyself in flesh . Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet 's grave ; for there must I use thee . Enter FRIAR JOHN
FRIAR JOHN : Holy Franciscan friar ! brother , ho ! Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
FRIAR LAURENCE : This same should be the voice of Friar John . Welcome from Mantua : what says Romeo ? Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
FRIAR JOHN : Going to find a bare-foot brother out One of our order , to associate me , Here in this city visiting the sick , And finding him , the searchers of the town , Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign , Seal 'd up the doors , and would not let us forth ; So that my speed to Mantua there was stay 'd .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?
FRIAR JOHN : I could not send it , --here it is again , -- Nor get a messenger to bring it thee , So fearful were they of infection .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Unhappy fortune ! by my brotherhood , The letter was not nice but full of charge Of dear import , and the neglecting it May do much danger . Friar John , go hence ; Get me an iron crow , and bring it straight Unto my cell .
FRIAR JOHN : Brother , I 'll go and bring it thee . Exit
FRIAR LAURENCE : Now must I to the monument alone ; Within three hours will fair Juliet wake : She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents ; But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come ; Poor living corse , closed in a dead man 's tomb ! Exit Enter PARIS , and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
PARIS : Give me thy torch , boy : hence , and stand aloof : Yet put it out , for I would not be seen . Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along , Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground ; So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread , Being loose , unfirm , with digging up of graves , But thou shalt hear it : whistle then to me , As signal that thou hear 'st something approach . Give me those flowers . Do as I bid thee , go .
PAGE : I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard ; yet I will adventure . Retires
