Servant : Perhaps you have learned it without book : but , I pray , can you read any thing you see ?
ROMEO : Ay , if I know the letters and the language .
Servant : Ye say honestly : rest you merry !
ROMEO : Stay , fellow ; I can read . Reads ' Signior Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; the lady widow of Vitravio ; Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; my fair niece Rosaline ; Livia ; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt , Lucio and the lively Helena . ' A fair assembly : whither should they come ?
Servant : Up .
ROMEO : Whither ?
Servant : To supper ; to our house .
ROMEO : Whose house ?
Servant : My master 's .
ROMEO : Indeed , I should have ask 'd you that before .
Servant : Now I 'll tell you without asking : my master is the great rich Capulet ; and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray , come and crush a cup of wine . Rest you merry ! Exit
BENVOLIO : At this same ancient feast of Capulet 's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest , With all the admired beauties of Verona : Go thither ; and , with unattainted eye , Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
ROMEO : When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood , then turn tears to fires ; And these , who often drown 'd could never die , Transparent heretics , be burnt for liars ! One fairer than my love ! the all-seeing sun Ne 'er saw her match since first the world begun .
BENVOLIO : Tut , you saw her fair , none else being by , Herself poised with herself in either eye : But in that crystal scales let there be weigh 'd Your lady 's love against some other maid That I will show you shining at this feast , And she shall scant show well that now shows best .
ROMEO : I 'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own . Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
LADY CAPULET : Nurse , where 's my daughter ? call her forth to me .
Nurse : Now , by my maidenhead , at twelve year old , I bade her come . What , lamb ! what , ladybird ! God forbid ! Where 's this girl ? What , Juliet ! Enter JULIET
JULIET : How now ! who calls ?
Nurse : Your mother .
JULIET : Madam , I am here . What is your will ?
LADY CAPULET : This is the matter : --Nurse , give leave awhile , We must talk in secret : --nurse , come back again ; I have remember 'd me , thou 's hear our counsel . Thou know 'st my daughter 's of a pretty age .
Nurse : Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .
LADY CAPULET : She 's not fourteen .
Nurse : I 'll lay fourteen of my teeth , -- And yet , to my teeth be it spoken , I have but four-- She is not fourteen . How long is it now To Lammas-tide ?
LADY CAPULET : A fortnight and odd days .
