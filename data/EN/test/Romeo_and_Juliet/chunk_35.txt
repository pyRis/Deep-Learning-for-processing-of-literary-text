ROMEO : Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron . Hold , take this letter ; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father . Give me the light : upon thy life , I charge thee , Whate 'er thou hear 'st or seest , stand all aloof , And do not interrupt me in my course . Why I descend into this bed of death , Is partly to behold my lady 's face ; But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring , a ring that I must use In dear employment : therefore hence , be gone : But if thou , jealous , dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do , By heaven , I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs : The time and my intents are savage-wild , More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea .
BALTHASAR : I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
ROMEO : So shalt thou show me friendship . Take thou that : Live , and be prosperous : and farewell , good fellow .
BALTHASAR : For all this same , I 'll hide me hereabout : His looks I fear , and his intents I doubt . Retires
ROMEO : Thou detestable maw , thou womb of death , Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth , Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open , And , in despite , I 'll cram thee with more food ! Opens the tomb
PARIS : This is that banish 'd haughty Montague , That murder 'd my love 's cousin , with which grief , It is supposed , the fair creature died ; And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies : I will apprehend him . Comes forward Stop thy unhallow 'd toil , vile Montague ! Can vengeance be pursued further than death ? Condemned villain , I do apprehend thee : Obey , and go with me ; for thou must die .
ROMEO : I must indeed ; and therefore came I hither . Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man ; Fly hence , and leave me : think upon these gone ; Let them affright thee . I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head , By urging me to fury : O , be gone ! By heaven , I love thee better than myself ; For I come hither arm 'd against myself : Stay not , be gone ; live , and hereafter say , A madman 's mercy bade thee run away .
PARIS : I do defy thy conjurations , And apprehend thee for a felon here .
ROMEO : Wilt thou provoke me ? then have at thee , boy ! They fight
PAGE : O Lord , they fight ! I will go call the watch . Exit
PARIS : O , I am slain ! Falls If thou be merciful , Open the tomb , lay me with Juliet . Dies
