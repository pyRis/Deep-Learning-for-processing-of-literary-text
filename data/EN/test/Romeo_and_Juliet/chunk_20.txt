ROMEO : This shall determine that . They fight ; TYBALT falls
BENVOLIO : Romeo , away , be gone ! The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain . Stand not amazed : the prince will doom thee death , If thou art taken : hence , be gone , away !
ROMEO : O , I am fortune 's fool !
BENVOLIO : Why dost thou stay ? Exit ROMEO Enter Citizens , & c
First Citizen : Which way ran he that kill 'd Mercutio ? Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
BENVOLIO : There lies that Tybalt .
First Citizen : Up , sir , go with me ; I charge thee in the princes name , obey . Enter Prince , attended ; MONTAGUE , CAPULET , their Wives , and others
PRINCE : Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
BENVOLIO : O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl : There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .
LADY CAPULET : Tybalt , my cousin ! O my brother 's child ! O prince ! O cousin ! husband ! O , the blood is spilt O my dear kinsman ! Prince , as thou art true , For blood of ours , shed blood of Montague . O cousin , cousin !
PRINCE : Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?
BENVOLIO : Tybalt , here slain , whom Romeo 's hand did slay ; Romeo that spoke him fair , bade him bethink How nice the quarrel was , and urged withal Your high displeasure : all this uttered With gentle breath , calm look , knees humbly bow 'd , Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace , but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutio 's breast , Who all as hot , turns deadly point to point , And , with a martial scorn , with one hand beats Cold death aside , and with the other sends It back to Tybalt , whose dexterity , Retorts it : Romeo he cries aloud , ' Hold , friends ! friends , part ! ' and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And ' twixt them rushes ; underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled ; But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertain 'd revenge , And to ' t they go like lightning , for , ere I Could draw to part them , was stout Tybalt slain . And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly . This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
LADY CAPULET : He is a kinsman to the Montague ; Affection makes him false ; he speaks not true : Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life . I beg for justice , which thou , prince , must give ; Romeo slew Tybalt , Romeo must not live .
PRINCE : Romeo slew him , he slew Mercutio ; Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
MONTAGUE : Not Romeo , prince , he was Mercutio 's friend ; His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .
PRINCE : And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence : I have an interest in your hate 's proceeding , My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding ; But I 'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine : I will be deaf to pleading and excuses ; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses : Therefore use none : let Romeo hence in haste , Else , when he 's found , that hour is his last . Bear hence this body and attend our will : Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill . Enter JULIET
