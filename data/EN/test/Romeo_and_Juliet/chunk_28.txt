Nurse : Faith , here it is . Romeo is banish 'd ; and all the world to nothing , That he dares ne 'er come back to challenge you ; Or , if he do , it needs must be by stealth . Then , since the case so stands as now it doth , I think it best you married with the county . O , he 's a lovely gentleman ! Romeo 's a dishclout to him : an eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath . Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first : or if it did not , Your first is dead ; or ' twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .
JULIET : Speakest thou from thy heart ?
Nurse : And from my soul too ; Or else beshrew them both .
JULIET : Amen !
Nurse : What ?
JULIET : Well , thou hast comforted me marvellous much . Go in : and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Laurence ' cell , To make confession and to be absolved .
Nurse : Marry , I will ; and this is wisely done . Exit
JULIET : Ancient damnation ! O most wicked fiend ! Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn , Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath praised him with above compare So many thousand times ? Go , counsellor ; Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain . I 'll to the friar , to know his remedy : If all else fail , myself have power to die . Exit Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
FRIAR LAURENCE : On Thursday , sir ? the time is very short .
PARIS : My father Capulet will have it so ; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste .
FRIAR LAURENCE : You say you do not know the lady 's mind : Uneven is the course , I like it not .
PARIS : Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt 's death , And therefore have I little talk 'd of love ; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears . Now , sir , her father counts it dangerous That she doth give her sorrow so much sway , And in his wisdom hastes our marriage , To stop the inundation of her tears ; Which , too much minded by herself alone , May be put from her by society : Now do you know the reason of this haste .
FRIAR LAURENCE : I would I knew not why it should be slow 'd . Look , sir , here comes the lady towards my cell . Enter JULIET
PARIS : Happily met , my lady and my wife !
JULIET : That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
PARIS : That may be must be , love , on Thursday next .
JULIET : What must be shall be .
FRIAR LAURENCE : That 's a certain text .
PARIS : Come you to make confession to this father ?
JULIET : To answer that , I should confess to you .
PARIS : Do not deny to him that you love me .
JULIET : I will confess to you that I love him .
PARIS : So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .
JULIET : If I do so , it will be of more price , Being spoke behind your back , than to your face .
PARIS : Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
JULIET : The tears have got small victory by that ; For it was bad enough before their spite .
PARIS : Thou wrong 'st it , more than tears , with that report .
JULIET : That is no slander , sir , which is a truth ; And what I spake , I spake it to my face .
PARIS : Thy face is mine , and thou hast slander 'd it .
JULIET : It may be so , for it is not mine own . Are you at leisure , holy father , now ; Or shall I come to you at evening mass ?
FRIAR LAURENCE : My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now . My lord , we must entreat the time alone .
PARIS : God shield I should disturb devotion ! Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye : Till then , adieu ; and keep this holy kiss . Exit
JULIET : O shut the door ! and when thou hast done so , Come weep with me ; past hope , past cure , past help !
FRIAR LAURENCE : Ah , Juliet , I already know thy grief ; It strains me past the compass of my wits : I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .
