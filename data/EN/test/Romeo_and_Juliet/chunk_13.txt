FRIAR LAURENCE : Benedicite ! What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ? Young son , it argues a distemper 'd head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed : Care keeps his watch in every old man 's eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie ; But where unbruised youth with unstuff 'd brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign : Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art up-roused by some distemperature ; Or if not so , then here I hit it right , Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night .
ROMEO : That last is true ; the sweeter rest was mine .
FRIAR LAURENCE : God pardon sin ! wast thou with Rosaline ?
ROMEO : With Rosaline , my ghostly father ? no ; I have forgot that name , and that name 's woe .
FRIAR LAURENCE : That 's my good son : but where hast thou been , then ?
ROMEO : I 'll tell thee , ere thou ask it me again . I have been feasting with mine enemy , Where on a sudden one hath wounded me , That 's by me wounded : both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies : I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift ; Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
ROMEO : Then plainly know my heart 's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet : As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine ; And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage : when and where and how We met , we woo 'd and made exchange of vow , I 'll tell thee as we pass ; but this I pray , That thou consent to marry us to-day .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here ! Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken ? young men 's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes . Jesu Maria , what a deal of brine Hath wash 'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline ! How much salt water thrown away in waste , To season love , that of it doth not taste ! The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears ; Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not wash 'd off yet : If e 'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline : And art thou changed ? pronounce this sentence then , Women may fall , when there 's no strength in men .
ROMEO : Thou chid 'st me oft for loving Rosaline .
FRIAR LAURENCE : For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
ROMEO : And bad 'st me bury love .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
ROMEO : I pray thee , chide not ; she whom I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow ; The other did not so .
FRIAR LAURENCE : O , she knew well Thy love did read by rote and could not spell . But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I 'll thy assistant be ; For this alliance may so happy prove , To turn your households ' rancour to pure love .
ROMEO : O , let us hence ; I stand on sudden haste .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Wisely and slow ; they stumble that run fast . Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
MERCUTIO : Where the devil should this Romeo be ? Came he not home to-night ?
BENVOLIO : Not to his father 's ; I spoke with his man .
MERCUTIO : Ah , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline . Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
BENVOLIO : Tybalt , the kinsman of old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father 's house .
MERCUTIO : A challenge , on my life .
BENVOLIO : Romeo will answer it .
MERCUTIO : Any man that can write may answer a letter .
BENVOLIO : Nay , he will answer the letter 's master , how he dares , being dared .
MERCUTIO : Alas poor Romeo ! he is already dead ; stabbed with a white wench 's black eye ; shot through the ear with a love-song ; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy 's butt-shaft : and is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?
BENVOLIO : Why , what is Tybalt ?
