CAPULET : Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone ; We have a trifling foolish banquet towards . Is it e 'en so ? why , then , I thank you all I thank you , honest gentlemen ; good night . More torches here ! Come on then , let 's to bed . Ah , sirrah , by my fay , it waxes late : I 'll to my rest .
JULIET : Come hither , nurse . What is yond gentleman ?
Nurse : The son and heir of old Tiberio .
JULIET : What 's he that now is going out of door ?
Nurse : Marry , that , I think , be young Petrucio .
JULIET : What 's he that follows there , that would not dance ?
Nurse : I know not .
JULIET : Go ask his name : if he be married . My grave is like to be my wedding bed .
Nurse : His name is Romeo , and a Montague ; The only son of your great enemy .
JULIET : My only love sprung from my only hate ! Too early seen unknown , and known too late ! Prodigious birth of love it is to me , That I must love a loathed enemy .
Nurse : What 's this ? what 's this ?
JULIET : A rhyme I learn 'd even now Of one I danced withal . One calls within ' Juliet . ' 
Nurse : Anon , anon ! Come , let 's away ; the strangers all are gone . Enter Chorus
Chorus : Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie , And young affection gapes to be his heir ; That fair for which love groan 'd for and would die , With tender Juliet match 'd , is now not fair . Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike betwitched by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love 's sweet bait from fearful hooks : Being held a foe , he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear ; And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new-beloved any where : But passion lends them power , time means , to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet . Exit Enter ROMEO
ROMEO : Can I go forward when my heart is here ? Turn back , dull earth , and find thy centre out . He climbs the wall , and leaps down within it Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
BENVOLIO : Romeo ! my cousin Romeo !
MERCUTIO : He is wise ; And , on my lie , hath stol 'n him home to bed .
BENVOLIO : He ran this way , and leap 'd this orchard wall : Call , good Mercutio .
MERCUTIO : Nay , I 'll conjure too . Romeo ! humours ! madman ! passion ! lover ! Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh : Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied ; Cry but ' Ay me ! ' pronounce but ' love ' and ' dove ; ' Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nick-name for her purblind son and heir , Young Adam Cupid , he that shot so trim , When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid ! He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not ; The ape is dead , and I must conjure him . I conjure thee by Rosaline 's bright eyes , By her high forehead and her scarlet lip , By her fine foot , straight leg and quivering thigh And the demesnes that there adjacent lie , That in thy likeness thou appear to us !
BENVOLIO : And if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
MERCUTIO : This cannot anger him : ' twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress ' circle Of some strange nature , letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjured it down ; That were some spite : my invocation Is fair and honest , and in his mistres s ' name I conjure only but to raise up him .
BENVOLIO : Come , he hath hid himself among these trees , To be consorted with the humorous night : Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
