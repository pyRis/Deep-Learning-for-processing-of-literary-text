JULIET : I would not for the world they saw thee here .
ROMEO : I have night 's cloak to hide me from their sight ; And but thou love me , let them find me here : My life were better ended by their hate , Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
JULIET : By whose direction found 'st thou out this place ?
ROMEO : By love , who first did prompt me to inquire ; He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes . I am no pilot ; yet , wert thou as far As that vast shore wash 'd with the farthest sea , I would adventure for such merchandise .
JULIET : Thou know 'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form , fain , fain deny What I have spoke : but farewell compliment ! Dost thou love me ? I know thou wilt say ' Ay , ' And I will take thy word : yet if thou swear 'st , Thou mayst prove false ; at lovers ' perjuries Then say , Jove laughs . O gentle Romeo , If thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully : Or if thou think 'st I am too quickly won , I 'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay , So thou wilt woo ; but else , not for the world . In truth , fair Montague , I am too fond , And therefore thou mayst think my ' havior light : But trust me , gentleman , I 'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange . I should have been more strange , I must confess , But that thou overheard 'st , ere I was ware , My true love 's passion : therefore pardon me , And not impute this yielding to light love , Which the dark night hath so discovered .
ROMEO : Lady , by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
JULIET : O , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon , That monthly changes in her circled orb , Lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
ROMEO : What shall I swear by ?
JULIET : Do not swear at all ; Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I 'll believe thee .
ROMEO : If my heart 's dear love--
JULIET : Well , do not swear : although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract to-night : It is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden ; Too like the lightning , which doth cease to be Ere one can say ' It lightens . ' Sweet , good night ! This bud of love , by summer 's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . Good night , good night ! as sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast !
ROMEO : O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
JULIET : What satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?
ROMEO : The exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine .
JULIET : I gave thee mine before thou didst request it : And yet I would it were to give again .
ROMEO : Wouldst thou withdraw it ? for what purpose , love ?
JULIET : But to be frank , and give it thee again . And yet I wish but for the thing I have : My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep ; the more I give to thee , The more I have , for both are infinite . Nurse calls within I hear some noise within ; dear love , adieu ! Anon , good nurse ! Sweet Montague , be true . Stay but a little , I will come again . Exit , above
ROMEO : O blessed , blessed night ! I am afeard . Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering-sweet to be substantial . Re-enter JULIET , above
