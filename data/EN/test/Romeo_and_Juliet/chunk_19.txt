TYBALT : Romeo , the hate I bear thee can afford No better term than this , --thou art a villain .
ROMEO : Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting : villain am I none ; Therefore farewell ; I see thou know 'st me not .
TYBALT : Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me ; therefore turn and draw .
ROMEO : I do protest , I never injured thee , But love thee better than thou canst devise , Till thou shalt know the reason of my love : And so , good Capulet , --which name I tender As dearly as my own , --be satisfied .
MERCUTIO : O calm , dishonourable , vile submission ! Alla stoccata carries it away . Draws Tybalt , you rat-catcher , will you walk ?
TYBALT : What wouldst thou have with me ?
MERCUTIO : Good king of cats , nothing but one of your nine lives ; that I mean to make bold withal , and as you shall use me hereafter , drybeat the rest of the eight . Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears ? make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
TYBALT : I am for you . Drawing
ROMEO : Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
MERCUTIO : Come , sir , your passado . They fight
ROMEO : Draw , Benvolio ; beat down their weapons . Gentlemen , for shame , forbear this outrage ! Tybalt , Mercutio , the prince expressly hath Forbidden bandying in Verona streets : Hold , Tybalt ! good Mercutio ! TYBALT under ROMEO 's arm stabs MERCUTIO , and flies with his followers
MERCUTIO : I am hurt . A plague o ' both your houses ! I am sped . Is he gone , and hath nothing ?
BENVOLIO : What , art thou hurt ?
MERCUTIO : Ay , ay , a scratch , a scratch ; marry , ' tis enough . Where is my page ? Go , villain , fetch a surgeon . Exit Page
ROMEO : Courage , man ; the hurt cannot be much .
MERCUTIO : No , ' tis not so deep as a well , nor so wide as a church-door ; but ' tis enough , ' twill serve : ask for me to-morrow , and you shall find me a grave man . I am peppered , I warrant , for this world . A plague o ' both your houses ! ' Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat , to scratch a man to death ! a braggart , a rogue , a villain , that fights by the book of arithmetic ! Why the devil came you between us ? I was hurt under your arm .
ROMEO : I thought all for the best .
MERCUTIO : Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint . A plague o ' both your houses ! They have made worms ' meat of me : I have it , And soundly too : your houses !
ROMEO : This gentleman , the prince 's near ally , My very friend , hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf ; my reputation stain 'd With Tybalt 's slander , --Tybalt , that an hour Hath been my kinsman ! O sweet Juliet , Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper soften 'd valour 's steel ! Re-enter BENVOLIO
BENVOLIO : O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio 's dead ! That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds , Which too untimely here did scorn the earth .
ROMEO : This day 's black fate on more days doth depend ; This but begins the woe , others must end .
BENVOLIO : Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
ROMEO : Alive , in triumph ! and Mercutio slain ! Away to heaven , respective lenity , And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now ! Re-enter TYBALT Now , Tybalt , take the villain back again , That late thou gavest me ; for Mercutio 's soul Is but a little way above our heads , Staying for thine to keep him company : Either thou , or I , or both , must go with him .
TYBALT : Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here , Shalt with him hence .
