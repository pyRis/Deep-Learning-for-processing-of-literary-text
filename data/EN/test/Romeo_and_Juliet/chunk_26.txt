JULIET : Villain and he be many miles asunder.-- God Pardon him ! I do , with all my heart ; And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart .
LADY CAPULET : That is , because the traitor murderer lives .
JULIET : Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands : Would none but I might venge my cousin 's death !
LADY CAPULET : We will have vengeance for it , fear thou not : Then weep no more . I 'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banish 'd runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustom 'd dram , That he shall soon keep Tybalt company : And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
JULIET : Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him--dead-- Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex 'd . Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it ; That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet . O , how my heart abhors To hear him named , and cannot come to him . To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughter 'd him !
LADY CAPULET : Find thou the means , and I 'll find such a man . But now I 'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
JULIET : And joy comes well in such a needy time : What are they , I beseech your ladyship ?
LADY CAPULET : Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child ; One who , to put thee from thy heaviness , Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy , That thou expect 'st not nor I look 'd not for .
JULIET : Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
LADY CAPULET : Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter 's Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
JULIET : Now , by Saint Peter 's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride . I wonder at this haste ; that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo . I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet ; and , when I do , I swear , It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris . These are news indeed !
LADY CAPULET : Here comes your father ; tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands . Enter CAPULET and Nurse
CAPULET : When the sun sets , the air doth drizzle dew ; But for the sunset of my brother 's son It rains downright . How now ! a conduit , girl ? what , still in tears ? Evermore showering ? In one little body Thou counterfeit 'st a bark , a sea , a wind ; For still thy eyes , which I may call the sea , Do ebb and flow with tears ; the bark thy body is , Sailing in this salt flood ; the winds , thy sighs ; Who , raging with thy tears , and they with them , Without a sudden calm , will overset Thy tempest-tossed body . How now , wife ! Have you deliver 'd to her our decree ?
LADY CAPULET : Ay , sir ; but she will none , she gives you thanks . I would the fool were married to her grave !
CAPULET : Soft ! take me with you , take me with you , wife . How ! will she none ? doth she not give us thanks ? Is she not proud ? doth she not count her blest , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom ?
JULIET : Not proud , you have ; but thankful , that you have : Proud can I never be of what I hate ; But thankful even for hate , that is meant love .
