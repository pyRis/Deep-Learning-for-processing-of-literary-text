FRIAR LAURENCE : I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale . Romeo , there dead , was husband to that Juliet ; And she , there dead , that Romeo 's faithful wife : I married them ; and their stol 'n marriage-day Was Tybalt 's dooms-day , whose untimely death Banish 'd the new-made bridegroom from the city , For whom , and not for Tybalt , Juliet pined . You , to remove that siege of grief from her , Betroth 'd and would have married her perforce To County Paris : then comes she to me , And , with wild looks , bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage , Or in my cell there would she kill herself . Then gave I her , so tutor 'd by my art , A sleeping potion ; which so took effect As I intended , for it wrought on her The form of death : meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrow 'd grave , Being the time the potion 's force should cease . But he which bore my letter , Friar John , Was stay 'd by accident , and yesternight Return 'd my letter back . Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking , Came I to take her from her kindred 's vault ; Meaning to keep her closely at my cell , Till I conveniently could send to Romeo : But when I came , some minute ere the time Of her awaking , here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead . She wakes ; and I entreated her come forth , And bear this work of heaven with patience : But then a noise did scare me from the tomb ; And she , too desperate , would not go with me , But , as it seems , did violence on herself . All this I know ; and to the marriage Her nurse is privy : and , if aught in this Miscarried by my fault , let my old life Be sacrificed , some hour before his time , Unto the rigour of severest law .
PRINCE : We still have known thee for a holy man . Where 's Romeo 's man ? what can he say in this ?
BALTHASAR : I brought my master news of Juliet 's death ; And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place , to this same monument . This letter he early bid me give his father , And threatened me with death , going in the vault , I departed not and left him there .
PRINCE : Give me the letter ; I will look on it . Where is the county 's page , that raised the watch ? Sirrah , what made your master in this place ?
PAGE : He came with flowers to strew his lady 's grave ; And bid me stand aloof , and so I did : Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb ; And by and by my master drew on him ; And then I ran away to call the watch .
PRINCE : This letter doth make good the friar 's words , Their course of love , the tidings of her death : And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ' pothecary , and therewithal Came to this vault to die , and lie with Juliet . Where be these enemies ? Capulet ! Montague ! See , what a scourge is laid upon your hate , That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love . And I for winking at your discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen : all are punish 'd .
CAPULET : O brother Montague , give me thy hand : This is my daughter 's jointure , for no more Can I demand .
MONTAGUE : But I can give thee more : For I will raise her statue in pure gold ; That while Verona by that name is known , There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet .
CAPULET : As rich shall Romeo 's by his lady 's lie ; Poor sacrifices of our enmity !
