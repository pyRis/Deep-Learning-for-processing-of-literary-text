PRINCE : We still have known thee for a holy man . Where 's Romeo 's man ? what can he say in this ?
BALTHASAR : I brought my master news of Juliet 's death ; And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place , to this same monument . This letter he early bid me give his father , And threatened me with death , going in the vault , I departed not and left him there .
PRINCE : Give me the letter ; I will look on it . Where is the county 's page , that raised the watch ? Sirrah , what made your master in this place ?
PAGE : He came with flowers to strew his lady 's grave ; And bid me stand aloof , and so I did : Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb ; And by and by my master drew on him ; And then I ran away to call the watch .
PRINCE : This letter doth make good the friar 's words , Their course of love , the tidings of her death : And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ' pothecary , and therewithal Came to this vault to die , and lie with Juliet . Where be these enemies ? Capulet ! Montague ! See , what a scourge is laid upon your hate , That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love . And I for winking at your discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen : all are punish 'd .
CAPULET : O brother Montague , give me thy hand : This is my daughter 's jointure , for no more Can I demand .
MONTAGUE : But I can give thee more : For I will raise her statue in pure gold ; That while Verona by that name is known , There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet .
CAPULET : As rich shall Romeo 's by his lady 's lie ; Poor sacrifices of our enmity !
