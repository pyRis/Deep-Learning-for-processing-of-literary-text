ROMEO : In faith , I will . Let me peruse this face . Mercutio 's kinsman , noble County Paris ! What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet : Said he not so ? or did I dream it so ? Or am I mad , hearing him talk of Juliet , To think it was so ? O , give me thy hand , One writ with me in sour misfortune 's book ! I 'll bury thee in a triumphant grave ; A grave ? O no ! a lantern , slaughter 'd youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light . Death , lie thou there , by a dead man interr 'd . Laying PARIS in the tomb How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry ! which their keepers call A lightning before death : O , how may I Call this a lightning ? O my love ! my wife ! Death , that hath suck 'd the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty : Thou art not conquer 'd ; beauty 's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks , And death 's pale flag is not advanced there . Tybalt , liest thou there in thy bloody sheet ? O , what more favour can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ? Forgive me , cousin ! Ah , dear Juliet , Why art thou yet so fair ? shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour ? For fear of that , I still will stay with thee ; And never from this palace of dim night Depart again : here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber-maids ; O , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh . Eyes , look your last ! Arms , take your last embrace ! and , lips , O you The doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death ! Come , bitter conduct , come , unsavoury guide ! Thou desperate pilot , now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark ! Here 's to my love ! Drinks O true apothecary ! Thy drugs are quick . Thus with a kiss I die . Dies Enter , at the other end of the churchyard , FRIAR LAURENCE , with a lantern , crow , and spade
FRIAR LAURENCE : Saint Francis be my speed ! how oft to-night Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! Who 's there ?
BALTHASAR : Here 's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Bliss be upon you ! Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond , that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ? as I discern , It burneth in the Capel 's monument .
BALTHASAR : It doth so , holy sir ; and there 's my master , One that you love .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Who is it ?
BALTHASAR : Romeo .
FRIAR LAURENCE : How long hath he been there ?
BALTHASAR : Full half an hour .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Go with me to the vault .
BALTHASAR : I dare not , sir My master knows not but I am gone hence ; And fearfully did menace me with death , If I did stay to look on his intents .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Stay , then ; I 'll go alone . Fear comes upon me : O , much I fear some ill unlucky thing .
BALTHASAR : As I did sleep under this yew-tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Romeo ! Advances Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre ? What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour 'd by this place of peace ? Enters the tomb Romeo ! O , pale ! Who else ? what , Paris too ? And steep 'd in blood ? Ah , what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance ! The lady stirs . JULIET wakes
JULIET : O comfortable friar ! where is my lord ? I do remember well where I should be , And there I am . Where is my Romeo ? Noise within
FRIAR LAURENCE : I hear some noise . Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep : A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents . Come , come away . Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead ; And Paris too . Come , I 'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns : Stay not to question , for the watch is coming ; Come , go , good Juliet , Noise again I dare no longer stay .
JULIET : Go , get thee hence , for I will not away . Exit FRIAR LAURENCE What 's here ? a cup , closed in my true love 's hand ? Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end : O churl ! drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ? I will kiss thy lips ; Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make die with a restorative . Kisses him Thy lips are warm .
First Watchman : Lead , boy : which way ?
JULIET : Yea , noise ? then I 'll be brief . O happy dagger ! Snatching ROMEO 's dagger This is thy sheath ; Stabs herself there rust , and let me die . Falls on ROMEO 's body , and dies Enter Watch , with the Page of PARIS
PAGE : This is the place ; there , where the torch doth burn .
First Watchman : The ground is bloody ; search about the churchyard : Go , some of you , whoe 'er you find attach . Pitiful sight ! here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm , and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried . Go , tell the prince : run to the Capulets : Raise up the Montagues : some others search : We see the ground whereon these woes do lie ; But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry . Re-enter some of the Watch , with BALTHASAR
Second Watchman : Here 's Romeo 's man ; we found him in the churchyard .
First Watchman : Hold him in safety , till the prince come hither . Re-enter others of the Watch , with FRIAR LAURENCE
