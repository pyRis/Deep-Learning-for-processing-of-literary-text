JULIET : Where I have learn 'd me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoin 'd By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here , And beg your pardon : pardon , I beseech you ! Henceforward I am ever ruled by you .
CAPULET : Send for the county ; go tell him of this : I 'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning .
JULIET : I met the youthful lord at Laurence ' cell ; And gave him what becomed love I might , Not step o 'er the bounds of modesty .
CAPULET : Why , I am glad on 't ; this is well : stand up : This is as 't should be . Let me see the county ; Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither . Now , afore God ! this reverend holy friar , Our whole city is much bound to him .
JULIET : Nurse , will you go with me into my closet , To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow ?
LADY CAPULET : No , not till Thursday ; there is time enough .
CAPULET : Go , nurse , go with her : we 'll to church to-morrow .
LADY CAPULET : We shall be short in our provision : ' Tis now near night .
CAPULET : Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife : Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her ; I 'll not to bed to-night ; let me alone ; I 'll play the housewife for this once . What , ho ! They are all forth . Well , I will walk myself To County Paris , to prepare him up Against to-morrow : my heart is wondrous light , Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim 'd . Enter JULIET and Nurse
JULIET : Ay , those attires are best : but , gentle nurse , I pray thee , leave me to my self to-night , For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state , Which , well thou know 'st , is cross , and full of sin . Enter LADY CAPULET
LADY CAPULET : What , are you busy , ho ? need you my help ?
JULIET : No , madam ; we have cull 'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow : So please you , let me now be left alone , And let the nurse this night sit up with you ; For , I am sure , you have your hands full all , In this so sudden business .
LADY CAPULET : Good night : Get thee to bed , and rest ; for thou hast need .
