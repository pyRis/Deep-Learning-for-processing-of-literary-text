SAMPSON : Gregory , o ' my word , we 'll not carry coals .
GREGORY : No , for then we should be colliers .
SAMPSON : I mean , an we be in choler , we 'll draw .
GREGORY : Ay , while you live , draw your neck out o ' the collar .
SAMPSON : I strike quickly , being moved .
GREGORY : But thou art not quickly moved to strike .
SAMPSON : A dog of the house of Montague moves me .
GREGORY : To move is to stir ; and to be valiant is to stand : therefore , if thou art moved , thou runn 'st away .
SAMPSON : A dog of that house shall move me to stand : I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague 's .
GREGORY : That shows thee a weak slave ; for the weakest goes to the wall .
SAMPSON : True ; and therefore women , being the weaker vessels , are ever thrust to the wall : therefore I will push Montague 's men from the wall , and thrust his maids to the wall .
GREGORY : The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .
SAMPSON : ' Tis all one , I will show myself a tyrant : when I have fought with the men , I will be cruel with the maids , and cut off their heads .
GREGORY : The heads of the maids ?
SAMPSON : Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads ; take it in what sense thou wilt .
GREGORY : They must take it in sense that feel it .
SAMPSON : Me they shall feel while I am able to stand : and ' tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .
GREGORY : ' Tis well thou art not fish ; if thou hadst , thou hadst been poor John . Draw thy tool ! here comes two of the house of the Montagues .
SAMPSON : My naked weapon is out : quarrel , I will back thee .
GREGORY : How ! turn thy back and run ?
SAMPSON : Fear me not .
GREGORY : No , marry ; I fear thee !
SAMPSON : Let us take the law of our sides ; let them begin .
GREGORY : I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .
SAMPSON : Nay , as they dare . I will bite my thumb at them ; which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it . Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
ABRAHAM : Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
SAMPSON : I do bite my thumb , sir .
ABRAHAM : Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
SAMPSON : Is the law of our side , if I say ay ?
GREGORY : No .
SAMPSON : No , sir , I do not bite my thumb at you , sir , but I bite my thumb , sir .
GREGORY : Do you quarrel , sir ?
ABRAHAM : Quarrel sir ! no , sir .
SAMPSON : If you do , sir , I am for you : I serve as good a man as you .
ABRAHAM : No better .
SAMPSON : Well , sir .
GREGORY : Say ' better : ' here comes one of my master 's kinsmen .
SAMPSON : Yes , better , sir .
ABRAHAM : You lie .
SAMPSON : Draw , if you be men . Gregory , remember thy swashing blow . They fight Enter BENVOLIO
BENVOLIO : Part , fools ! Put up your swords ; you know not what you do . Beats down their swords Enter TYBALT
TYBALT : What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ? Turn thee , Benvolio , look upon thy death .
BENVOLIO : I do but keep the peace : put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
TYBALT : What , drawn , and talk of peace ! I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee : Have at thee , coward ! They fight Enter , several of both houses , who join the fray ; then enter Citizens , with clubs
