First Musician : Not a dump we ; ' tis no time to play now .
PETER : You will not , then ?
First Musician : No .
PETER : I will then give it you soundly .
First Musician : What will you give us ?
PETER : No money , on my faith , but the gleek ; I will give you the minstrel .
First Musician : Then I will give you the serving-creature .
PETER : Then will I lay the serving-creature 's dagger on your pate . I will carry no crotchets : I 'll re you , I 'll fa you ; do you note me ?
First Musician : An you re us and fa us , you note us .
Second Musician : Pray you , put up your dagger , and put out your wit .
PETER : Then have at you with my wit ! I will dry-beat you with an iron wit , and put up my iron dagger . Answer me like men : ' When griping grief the heart doth wound , And doleful dumps the mind oppress , Then music with her silver sound ' -- why ' silver sound ' ? why ' music with her silver sound ' ? What say you , Simon Catling ?
Musician : Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
PETER : Pretty ! What say you , Hugh Rebeck ?
Second Musician : I say ' silver sound , ' because musicians sound for silver .
PETER : Pretty too ! What say you , James Soundpost ?
Third Musician : Faith , I know not what to say .
PETER : O , I cry you mercy ; you are the singer : I will say for you . It is ' music with her silver sound , ' because musicians have no gold for sounding : ' Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress . ' Exit
First Musician : What a pestilent knave is this same !
Second Musician : Hang him , Jack ! Come , we 'll in here ; tarry for the mourners , and stay dinner . Enter ROMEO
ROMEO : If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand : My bosom 's lord sits lightly in his throne ; And all this day an unaccustom 'd spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts . I dreamt my lady came and found me dead-- Strange dream , that gives a dead man leave to think ! -- And breathed such life with kisses in my lips , That I revived , and was an emperor . Ah me ! how sweet is love itself possess 'd , When but love 's shadows are so rich in joy ! Enter BALTHASAR , booted News from Verona ! --How now , Balthasar ! Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ? How doth my lady ? Is my father well ? How fares my Juliet ? that I ask again ; For nothing can be ill , if she be well .
BALTHASAR : Then she is well , and nothing can be ill : Her body sleeps in Capel 's monument , And her immortal part with angels lives . I saw her laid low in her kindred 's vault , And presently took post to tell it you : O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .
ROMEO : Is it even so ? then I defy you , stars ! Thou know 'st my lodging : get me ink and paper , And hire post-horses ; I will hence to-night .
BALTHASAR : I do beseech you , sir , have patience : Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .
ROMEO : Tush , thou art deceived : Leave me , and do the thing I bid thee do . Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
BALTHASAR : No , my good lord .
