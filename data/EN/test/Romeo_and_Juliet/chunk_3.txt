BENVOLIO : Be ruled by me , forget to think of her .
ROMEO : O , teach me how I should forget to think .
BENVOLIO : By giving liberty unto thine eyes ; Examine other beauties .
ROMEO : ' Tis the way To call hers exquisite , in question more : These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows Being black put us in mind they hide the fair ; He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost : Show me a mistress that is passing fair , What doth her beauty serve , but as a note Where I may read who pass 'd that passing fair ? Farewell : thou canst not teach me to forget .
BENVOLIO : I 'll pay that doctrine , or else die in debt . Enter CAPULET , PARIS , and Servant
CAPULET : But Montague is bound as well as I , In penalty alike ; and ' tis not hard , I think , For men so old as we to keep the peace .
PARIS : Of honourable reckoning are you both ; And pity ' tis you lived at odds so long . But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
CAPULET : But saying o 'er what I have said before : My child is yet a stranger in the world ; She hath not seen the change of fourteen years , Let two more summers wither in their pride , Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride .
PARIS : Younger than she are happy mothers made .
CAPULET : And too soon marr 'd are those so early made . The earth hath swallow 'd all my hopes but she , She is the hopeful lady of my earth : But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart , My will to her consent is but a part ; An she agree , within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice . This night I hold an old accustom 'd feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest , Such as I love ; and you , among the store , One more , most welcome , makes my number more . At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light : Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-apparell 'd April on the heel Of limping winter treads , even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house ; hear all , all see , And like her most whose merit most shall be : Which on more view , of many mine being one May stand in number , though in reckoning none , Come , go with me . To Servant , giving a paper Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona ; find those persons out Whose names are written there , and to them say , My house and welcome on their pleasure stay .
Servant : Find them out whose names are written here ! It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard , and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil , and the painter with his nets ; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ . I must to the learned.--In good time . Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
BENVOLIO : Tut , man , one fire burns out another 's burning , One pain is lessen 'd by another 's anguish ; Turn giddy , and be holp by backward turning ; One desperate grief cures with another 's languish : Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .
ROMEO : Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that .
BENVOLIO : For what , I pray thee ?
ROMEO : For your broken shin .
BENVOLIO : Why , Romeo , art thou mad ?
ROMEO : Not mad , but bound more than a mad-man is ; Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipp 'd and tormented and--God-den , good fellow .
Servant : God gi ' god-den . I pray , sir , can you read ?
ROMEO : Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
