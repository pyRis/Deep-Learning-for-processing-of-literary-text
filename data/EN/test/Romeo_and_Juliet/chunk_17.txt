Nurse : Well , you have made a simple choice ; you know not how to choose a man : Romeo ! no , not he ; though his face be better than any man 's , yet his leg excels all men 's ; and for a hand , and a foot , and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare : he is not the flower of courtesy , but , I 'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb . Go thy ways , wench ; serve God . What , have you dined at home ?
JULIET : No , no : but all this did I know before . What says he of our marriage ? what of that ?
Nurse : Lord , how my head aches ! what a head have I ! It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces . My back o ' t ' other side , --O , my back , my back ! Beshrew your heart for sending me about , To catch my death with jaunting up and down !
JULIET : I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well . Sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
Nurse : Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , --Where is your mother ?
JULIET : Where is my mother ! why , she is within ; Where should she be ? How oddly thou repliest ! ' Your love says , like an honest gentleman , Where is your mother ? '
Nurse : O God 's lady dear ! Are you so hot ? marry , come up , I trow ; Is this the poultice for my aching bones ? Henceforward do your messages yourself .
JULIET : Here 's such a coil ! come , what says Romeo ?
Nurse : Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day ?
JULIET : I have .
Nurse : Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence ' cell ; There stays a husband to make you a wife : Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks , They 'll be in scarlet straight at any news . Hie you to church ; I must another way , To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird 's nest soon when it is dark : I am the drudge and toil in your delight , But you shall bear the burden soon at night . Go ; I 'll to dinner : hie you to the cell .
JULIET : Hie to high fortune ! Honest nurse , farewell . Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
FRIAR LAURENCE : So smile the heavens upon this holy act , That after hours with sorrow chide us not !
ROMEO : Amen , amen ! but come what sorrow can , It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight : Do thou but close our hands with holy words , Then love-devouring death do what he dare ; It is enough I may but call her mine .
FRIAR LAURENCE : These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die , like fire and powder , Which as they kiss consume : the sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite : Therefore love moderately ; long love doth so ; Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow . Enter JULIET Here comes the lady : O , so light a foot Will ne 'er wear out the everlasting flint : A lover may bestride the gossamer That idles in the wanton summer air , And yet not fall ; so light is vanity .
JULIET : Good even to my ghostly confessor .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
JULIET : As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
