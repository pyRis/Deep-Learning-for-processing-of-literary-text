Nurse : Peter !
PETER : Anon !
Nurse : My fan , Peter .
MERCUTIO : Good Peter , to hide her face ; for her fan 's the fairer face .
Nurse : God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
MERCUTIO : God ye good den , fair gentlewoman .
Nurse : Is it good den ?
MERCUTIO : ' Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
Nurse : Out upon you ! what a man are you !
ROMEO : One , gentlewoman , that God hath made for himself to mar .
Nurse : By my troth , it is well said ; ' for himself to mar , ' quoth a ' ? Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?
ROMEO : I can tell you ; but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him : I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
Nurse : You say well .
MERCUTIO : Yea , is the worst well ? very well took , i ' faith ; wisely , wisely .
Nurse : if you be he , sir , I desire some confidence with you .
BENVOLIO : She will indite him to some supper .
MERCUTIO : A bawd , a bawd , a bawd ! so ho !
ROMEO : What hast thou found ?
MERCUTIO : No hare , sir ; unless a hare , sir , in a lenten pie , that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent . Sings An old hare hoar , And an old hare hoar , Is very good meat in lent But a hare that is hoar Is too much for a score , When it hoars ere it be spent . Romeo , will you come to your father 's ? we 'll to dinner , thither .
ROMEO : I will follow you .
MERCUTIO : Farewell , ancient lady ; farewell , Singing ' lady , lady , lady . ' 
Nurse : Marry , farewell ! I pray you , sir , what saucy merchant was this , that was so full of his ropery ?
ROMEO : A gentleman , nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
Nurse : An a ' speak any thing against me , I 'll take him down , an a ' were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks ; and if I cannot , I 'll find those that shall . Scurvy knave ! I am none of his flirt-gills ; I am none of his skains-mates . And thou must stand by too , and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure ?
PETER : I saw no man use you a pleasure ; if I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you : I dare draw as soon as another man , if I see occasion in a good quarrel , and the law on my side .
Nurse : Now , afore God , I am so vexed , that every part about me quivers . Scurvy knave ! Pray you , sir , a word : and as I told you , my young lady bade me inquire you out ; what she bade me say , I will keep to myself : but first let me tell ye , if ye should lead her into a fool 's paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behavior , as they say : for the gentlewoman is young ; and , therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman , and very weak dealing .
ROMEO : Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress . I protest unto thee--
Nurse : Good heart , and , i ' faith , I will tell her as much : Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .
ROMEO : What wilt thou tell her , nurse ? thou dost not mark me .
