FRIAR LAURENCE : O , then I see that madmen have no ears .
ROMEO : How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
FRIAR LAURENCE : Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
ROMEO : Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel : Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair , And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave . Knocking within
FRIAR LAURENCE : Arise ; one knocks ; good Romeo , hide thyself .
ROMEO : Not I ; unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mist-like , infold me from the search of eyes . Knocking
FRIAR LAURENCE : Hark , how they knock ! Who 's there ? Romeo , arise ; Thou wilt be taken . Stay awhile ! Stand up ; Knocking Run to my study . By and by ! God 's will , What simpleness is this ! I come , I come ! Knocking Who knocks so hard ? whence come you ? what 's your will ?
Nurse : Let me come in , and you shall know my errand ; I come from Lady Juliet .
FRIAR LAURENCE : Welcome , then . Enter Nurse
Nurse : O holy friar , O , tell me , holy friar , Where is my lady 's lord , where 's Romeo ?
FRIAR LAURENCE : There on the ground , with his own tears made drunk .
Nurse : O , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case ! O woful sympathy ! Piteous predicament ! Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering . Stand up , stand up ; stand , and you be a man : For Juliet 's sake , for her sake , rise and stand ; Why should you fall into so deep an O ?
ROMEO : Nurse !
Nurse : Ah sir ! ah sir ! Well , death 's the end of all .
ROMEO : Spakest thou of Juliet ? how is it with her ? Doth she not think me an old murderer , Now I have stain 'd the childhood of our joy With blood removed but little from her own ? Where is she ? and how doth she ? and what says My conceal 'd lady to our cancell 'd love ?
Nurse : O , she says nothing , sir , but weeps and weeps ; And now falls on her bed ; and then starts up , And Tybalt calls ; and then on Romeo cries , And then down falls again .
ROMEO : As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her ; as that name 's cursed hand Murder 'd her kinsman . O , tell me , friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ? tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion . Drawing his sword
