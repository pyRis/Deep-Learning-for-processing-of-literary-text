PROSPERO : Let them be hunted soundly . At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies : Shortly shall all my labours end , and thou Shalt have the air at freedom : for a little Follow , and do me service . Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes , and ARIEL
PROSPERO : Now does my project gather to a head : My charms crack not ; my spirits obey ; and time Goes upright with his carriage . How 's the day ?
ARIEL : On the sixth hour ; at which time , my lord , You said our work should cease .
PROSPERO : I did say so , When first I raised the tempest . Say , my spirit , How fares the king and 's followers ?
ARIEL : Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge , Just as you left them ; all prisoners , sir , In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell ; They cannot budge till your release . The king , His brother and yours , abide all three distracted And the remainder mourning over them , Brimful of sorrow and dismay ; but chiefly Him that you term 'd , sir , ' The good old lord Gonzalo ; ' His tears run down his beard , like winter 's drops From eaves of reeds . Your charm so strongly works ' em That if you now beheld them , your affections Would become tender .
PROSPERO : Dost thou think so , spirit ?
ARIEL : Mine would , sir , were I human .
PROSPERO : And mine shall . Hast thou , which art but air , a touch , a feeling Of their afflictions , and shall not myself , One of their kind , that relish all as sharply , Passion as they , be kindlier moved than thou art ? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick , Yet with my nobler reason ' gaitist my fury Do I take part : the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance : they being penitent , The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further . Go release them , Ariel : My charms I 'll break , their senses I 'll restore , And they shall be themselves .
ARIEL : I 'll fetch them , sir . Exit
