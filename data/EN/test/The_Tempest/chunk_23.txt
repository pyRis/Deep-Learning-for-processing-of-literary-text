PROSPERO : Dost thou think so , spirit ?
ARIEL : Mine would , sir , were I human .
PROSPERO : And mine shall . Hast thou , which art but air , a touch , a feeling Of their afflictions , and shall not myself , One of their kind , that relish all as sharply , Passion as they , be kindlier moved than thou art ? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick , Yet with my nobler reason ' gaitist my fury Do I take part : the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance : they being penitent , The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further . Go release them , Ariel : My charms I 'll break , their senses I 'll restore , And they shall be themselves .
ARIEL : I 'll fetch them , sir . Exit
