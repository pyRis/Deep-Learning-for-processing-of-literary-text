CALIBAN : I 'll show thee every fertile inch o ' th ' island ; And I will kiss thy foot : I prithee , be my god .
TRINCULO : By this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster ! when ' s god 's asleep , he 'll rob his bottle .
CALIBAN : I 'll kiss thy foot ; I 'll swear myself thy subject .
STEPHANO : Come on then ; down , and swear .
TRINCULO : I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster . A most scurvy monster ! I could find in my heart to beat him , --
STEPHANO : Come , kiss .
TRINCULO : But that the poor monster 's in drink : an abominable monster !
CALIBAN : I 'll show thee the best springs ; I 'll pluck thee berries ; I 'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough . A plague upon the tyrant that I serve ! I 'll bear him no more sticks , but follow thee , Thou wondrous man .
TRINCULO : A most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a Poor drunkard !
CALIBAN : I prithee , let me bring thee where crabs grow ; And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts ; Show thee a jay 's nest and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset ; I 'll bring thee To clustering filberts and sometimes I 'll get thee Young scamels from the rock . Wilt thou go with me ?
STEPHANO : I prithee now , lead the way without any more talking . Trinculo , the king and all our company else being drowned , we will inherit here : here ; bear my bottle : fellow Trinculo , we 'll fill him by and by again .
CALIBAN : Farewell master ; farewell , farewell !
TRINCULO : A howling monster : a drunken monster !
CALIBAN : No more dams I 'll make for fish Nor fetch in firing At requiring ; Nor scrape trencher , nor wash dish ' Ban , ' Ban , Cacaliban Has a new master : get a new man . Freedom , hey-day ! hey-day , freedom ! freedom , hey-day , freedom !
STEPHANO : O brave monster ! Lead the way . Enter FERDINAND , bearing a log
FERDINAND : There be some sports are painful , and their labour Delight in them sets off : some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone and most poor matters Point to rich ends . This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious , but The mistress which I serve quickens what 's dead And makes my labours pleasures : O , she is Ten times more gentle than her father 's crabbed , And he 's composed of harshness . I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up , Upon a sore injunction : my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work , and says , such baseness Had never like executor . I forget : But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours , Most busy lest , when I do it . Enter MIRANDA ; and PROSPERO at a distance , unseen
MIRANDA : Alas , now , pray you , Work not so hard : I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin 'd to pile ! Pray , set it down and rest you : when this burns , ' Twill weep for having wearied you . My father Is hard at study ; pray now , rest yourself ; He 's safe for these three hours .
FERDINAND : O most dear mistress , The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do .
MIRANDA : If you 'll sit down , I 'll bear your logs the while : pray , give me that ; I 'll carry it to the pile .
FERDINAND : No , precious creature ; I had rather crack my sinews , break my back , Than you should such dishonour undergo , While I sit lazy by .
MIRANDA : It would become me As well as it does you : and I should do it With much more ease ; for my good will is to it , And yours it is against .
PROSPERO : Poor worm , thou art infected ! This visitation shows it .
