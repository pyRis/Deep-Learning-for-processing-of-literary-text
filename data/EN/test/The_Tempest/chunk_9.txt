ALONSO : You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense . Would I had never Married my daughter there ! for , coming thence , My son is lost and , in my rate , she too , Who is so far from Italy removed I ne 'er again shall see her . O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan , what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee ?
FRANCISCO : Sir , he may live : I saw him beat the surges under him , And ride upon their backs ; he trod the water , Whose enmity he flung aside , and breasted The surge most swoln that met him ; his bold head ' Bove the contentious waves he kept , and oar 'd Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To the shore , that o 'er his wave-worn basis bow 'd , As stooping to relieve him : I not doubt He came alive to land .
ALONSO : No , no , he 's gone .
SEBASTIAN : Sir , you may thank yourself for this great loss , That would not bless our Europe with your daughter , But rather lose her to an African ; Where she at least is banish 'd from your eye , Who hath cause to wet the grief on 't .
ALONSO : Prithee , peace .
SEBASTIAN : You were kneel 'd to and importuned otherwise By all of us , and the fair soul herself Weigh 'd between loathness and obedience , at Which end o ' the beam should bow . We have lost your son , I fear , for ever : Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business ' making Than we bring men to comfort them : The fault 's your own .
ALONSO : So is the dear 'st o ' the loss .
GONZALO : My lord Sebastian , The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in : you rub the sore , When you should bring the plaster .
SEBASTIAN : Very well .
ANTONIO : And most chirurgeonly .
GONZALO : It is foul weather in us all , good sir , When you are cloudy .
SEBASTIAN : Foul weather ?
ANTONIO : Very foul .
GONZALO : Had I plantation of this isle , my lord , --
ANTONIO : He 'ld sow 't with nettle-seed .
SEBASTIAN : Or docks , or mallows .
GONZALO : And were the king on 't , what would I do ?
SEBASTIAN : ' Scape being drunk for want of wine .
GONZALO : I ' the commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things ; for no kind of traffic Would I admit ; no name of magistrate ; Letters should not be known ; riches , poverty , And use of service , none ; contract , succession , Bourn , bound of land , tilth , vineyard , none ; No use of metal , corn , or wine , or oil ; No occupation ; all men idle , all ; And women too , but innocent and pure ; No sovereignty ; --
SEBASTIAN : Yet he would be king on 't .
ANTONIO : The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning .
GONZALO : All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavour : treason , felony , Sword , pike , knife , gun , or need of any engine , Would I not have ; but nature should bring forth , Of its own kind , all foison , all abundance , To feed my innocent people .
SEBASTIAN : No marrying ' mong his subjects ?
ANTONIO : None , man ; all idle : whores and knaves .
GONZALO : I would with such perfection govern , sir , To excel the golden age .
SEBASTIAN : God save his majesty !
ANTONIO : Long live Gonzalo !
GONZALO : And , --do you mark me , sir ?
ALONSO : Prithee , no more : thou dost talk nothing to me .
GONZALO : I do well believe your highness ; and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen , who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing .
ANTONIO : ' Twas you we laughed at .
GONZALO : Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you : so you may continue and laugh at nothing still .
ANTONIO : What a blow was there given !
SEBASTIAN : An it had not fallen flat-long .
GONZALO : You are gentlemen of brave metal ; you would lift the moon out of her sphere , if she would continue in it five weeks without changing . Enter ARIEL , invisible , playing solemn music
