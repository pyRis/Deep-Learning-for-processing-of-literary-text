PROSPERO : I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates Against my life : the minute of their plot Is almost come . To the Spirits Well done ! avoid ; no more !
FERDINAND : This is strange : your father 's in some passion That works him strongly .
MIRANDA : Never till this day Saw I him touch 'd with anger so distemper 'd .
PROSPERO : You do look , my son , in a moved sort , As if you were dismay 'd : be cheerful , sir . Our revels now are ended . These our actors , As I foretold you , were all spirits and Are melted into air , into thin air : And , like the baseless fabric of this vision , The cloud-capp 'd towers , the gorgeous palaces , The solemn temples , the great globe itself , Ye all which it inherit , shall dissolve And , like this insubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a rack behind . We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep . Sir , I am vex 'd ; Bear with my weakness ; my , brain is troubled : Be not disturb 'd with my infirmity : If you be pleased , retire into my cell And there repose : a turn or two I 'll walk , To still my beating mind .
FERDINAND MIRANDA : We wish your peace .
PROSPERO : Come with a thought I thank thee , Ariel : come . Enter ARIEL
ARIEL : Thy thoughts I cleave to . What 's thy pleasure ?
PROSPERO : Spirit , We must prepare to meet with Caliban .
ARIEL : Ay , my commander : when I presented Ceres , I thought to have told thee of it , but I fear 'd Lest I might anger thee .
PROSPERO : Say again , where didst thou leave these varlets ?
ARIEL : I told you , sir , they were red-hot with drinking ; So fun of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces ; beat the ground For kissing of their feet ; yet always bending Towards their project . Then I beat my tabour ; At which , like unback 'd colts , they prick 'd their ears , Advanced their eyelids , lifted up their noses As they smelt music : so I charm 'd their ears That calf-like they my lowing follow 'd through Tooth 'd briers , sharp furzes , pricking goss and thorns , Which entered their frail shins : at last I left them I ' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell , There dancing up to the chins , that the foul lake O 'erstunk their feet .
PROSPERO : This was well done , my bird . Thy shape invisible retain thou still : The trumpery in my house , go bring it hither , For stale to catch these thieves .
ARIEL : I go , I go . Exit
PROSPERO : A devil , a born devil , on whose nature Nurture can never stick ; on whom my pains , Humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost ; And as with age his body uglier grows , So his mind cankers . I will plague them all , Even to roaring . Re-enter ARIEL , loaden with glistering apparel , & c Come , hang them on this line . PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible . Enter CALIBAN , STEPHANO , and TRINCULO , all wet
CALIBAN : Pray you , tread softly , that the blind mole may not Hear a foot fall : we now are near his cell .
STEPHANO : Monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the Jack with us .
TRINCULO : Monster , I do smell all horse-piss ; at which my nose is in great indignation .
STEPHANO : So is mine . Do you hear , monster ? If I should take a displeasure against you , look you , --
TRINCULO : Thou wert but a lost monster .
CALIBAN : Good my lord , give me thy favour still . Be patient , for the prize I 'll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance : therefore speak softly . All 's hush 'd as midnight yet .
