GONZALO : Well , I have done : but yet , --
SEBASTIAN : He will be talking .
ANTONIO : Which , of he or Adrian , for a good wager , first begins to crow ?
SEBASTIAN : The old cock .
ANTONIO : The cockerel .
SEBASTIAN : Done . The wager ?
ANTONIO : A laughter .
SEBASTIAN : A match !
ADRIAN : Though this island seem to be desert , --
SEBASTIAN : Ha , ha , ha ! So , you 're paid .
ADRIAN : Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible , --
SEBASTIAN : Yet , --
ADRIAN : Yet , --
ANTONIO : He could not miss 't .
ADRIAN : It must needs be of subtle , tender and delicate temperance .
ANTONIO : Temperance was a delicate wench .
SEBASTIAN : Ay , and a subtle ; as he most learnedly delivered .
ADRIAN : The air breathes upon us here most sweetly .
SEBASTIAN : As if it had lungs and rotten ones .
ANTONIO : Or as ' twere perfumed by a fen .
GONZALO : Here is everything advantageous to life .
ANTONIO : True ; save means to live .
SEBASTIAN : Of that there 's none , or little .
GONZALO : How lush and lusty the grass looks ! how green !
ANTONIO : The ground indeed is tawny .
SEBASTIAN : With an eye of green in 't .
ANTONIO : He misses not much .
SEBASTIAN : No ; he doth but mistake the truth totally .
GONZALO : But the rarity of it is , --which is indeed almost beyond credit , --
SEBASTIAN : As many vouched rarities are .
GONZALO : That our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the sea , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses , being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water .
ANTONIO : If but one of his pockets could speak , would it not say he lies ?
SEBASTIAN : Ay , or very falsely pocket up his report
GONZALO : Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric , at the marriage of the king 's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
SEBASTIAN : ' Twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
ADRIAN : Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen .
GONZALO : Not since widow Dido 's time .
ANTONIO : Widow ! a pox o ' that ! How came that widow in ? widow Dido !
SEBASTIAN : What if he had said ' widower AEneas ' too ? Good Lord , how you take it !
ADRIAN : ' Widow Dido ' said you ? you make me study of that : she was of Carthage , not of Tunis .
GONZALO : This Tunis , sir , was Carthage .
ADRIAN : Carthage ?
GONZALO : I assure you , Carthage .
SEBASTIAN : His word is more than the miraculous harp ; he hath raised the wall and houses too .
ANTONIO : What impossible matter will he make easy next ?
SEBASTIAN : I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
ANTONIO : And , sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .
GONZALO : Ay .
ANTONIO : Why , in good time .
GONZALO : Sir , we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter , who is now queen .
ANTONIO : And the rarest that e 'er came there .
SEBASTIAN : Bate , I beseech you , widow Dido .
ANTONIO : O , widow Dido ! ay , widow Dido .
GONZALO : Is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it ? I mean , in a sort .
ANTONIO : That sort was well fished for .
GONZALO : When I wore it at your daughter 's marriage ?
