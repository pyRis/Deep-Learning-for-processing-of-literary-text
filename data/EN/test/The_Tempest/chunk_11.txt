SEBASTIAN : What stuff is this ! how say you ? ' Tis true , my brother 's daughter 's queen of Tunis ; So is she heir of Naples ; ' twixt which regions There is some space .
ANTONIO : A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out , ' How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples ? Keep in Tunis , And let Sebastian wake . ' Say , this were death That now hath seized them ; why , they were no worse Than now they are . There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps ; lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo ; I myself could make A chough of as deep chat . O , that you bore The mind that I do ! what a sleep were this For your advancement ! Do you understand me ?
SEBASTIAN : Methinks I do .
ANTONIO : And how does your content Tender your own good fortune ?
SEBASTIAN : I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero .
ANTONIO : True : And look how well my garments sit upon me ; Much feater than before : my brother 's servants Were then my fellows ; now they are my men .
SEBASTIAN : But , for your conscience ?
ANTONIO : Ay , sir ; where lies that ? if ' twere a kibe , ' Twould put me to my slipper : but I feel not This deity in my bosom : twenty consciences , That stand ' twixt me and Milan , candied be they And melt ere they molest ! Here lies your brother , No better than the earth he lies upon , If he were that which now he 's like , that 's dead ; Whom I , with this obedient steel , three inches of it , Can lay to bed for ever ; whiles you , doing thus , To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel , this Sir Prudence , who Should not upbraid our course . For all the rest , They 'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk ; They 'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour .
SEBASTIAN : Thy case , dear friend , Shall be my precedent ; as thou got 'st Milan , I 'll come by Naples . Draw thy sword : one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest ; And I the king shall love thee .
ANTONIO : Draw together ; And when I rear my hand , do you the like , To fall it on Gonzalo .
SEBASTIAN : O , but one word . They talk apart Re-enter ARIEL , invisible
ARIEL : My master through his art foresees the danger That you , his friend , are in ; and sends me forth-- For else his project dies--to keep them living . Sings in GONZALO 's ear While you here do snoring lie , Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take . If of life you keep a care , Shake off slumber , and beware : Awake , awake !
ANTONIO : Then let us both be sudden .
GONZALO : Now , good angels Preserve the king . They wake
ALONSO : Why , how now ? ho , awake ! Why are you drawn ? Wherefore this ghastly looking ?
GONZALO : What 's the matter ?
SEBASTIAN : Whiles we stood here securing your repose , Even now , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls , or rather lions : did 't not wake you ? It struck mine ear most terribly .
ALONSO : I heard nothing .
ANTONIO : O , ' twas a din to fright a monster 's ear , To make an earthquake ! sure , it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions .
ALONSO : Heard you this , Gonzalo ?
GONZALO : Upon mine honour , sir , I heard a humming , And that a strange one too , which did awake me : I shaked you , sir , and cried : as mine eyes open 'd , I saw their weapons drawn : there was a noise , That 's verily . ' Tis best we stand upon our guard , Or that we quit this place ; let 's draw our weapons .
ALONSO : Lead off this ground ; and let 's make further search For my poor son .
GONZALO : Heavens keep him from these beasts ! For he is , sure , i ' the island .
ALONSO : Lead away .
