FERDINAND : No , noble mistress ; ' tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night . I do beseech you-- Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers-- What is your name ?
MIRANDA : Miranda.--O my father , I have broke your hest to say so !
FERDINAND : Admired Miranda ! Indeed the top of admiration ! worth What 's dearest to the world ! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear : for several virtues Have I liked several women ; never any With so fun soul , but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed And put it to the foil : but you , O you , So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature 's best !
MIRANDA : I do not know One of my sex ; no woman 's face remember , Save , from my glass , mine own ; nor have I seen More that I may call men than you , good friend , And my dear father : how features are abroad , I am skilless of ; but , by my modesty , The jewel in my dower , I would not wish Any companion in the world but you , Nor can imagination form a shape , Besides yourself , to like of . But I prattle Something too wildly and my father 's precepts I therein do forget .
FERDINAND : I am in my condition A prince , Miranda ; I do think , a king ; I would , not so ! --and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth . Hear my soul speak : The very instant that I saw you , did My heart fly to your service ; there resides , To make me slave to it ; and for your sake Am I this patient log--man .
MIRANDA : Do you love me ?
FERDINAND : O heaven , O earth , bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event If I speak true ! if hollowly , invert What best is boded me to mischief ! I Beyond all limit of what else i ' the world Do love , prize , honour you .
MIRANDA : I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of .
PROSPERO : Fair encounter Of two most rare affections ! Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between ' em !
FERDINAND : Wherefore weep you ?
MIRANDA : At mine unworthiness that dare not offer What I desire to give , and much less take What I shall die to want . But this is trifling ; And all the more it seeks to hide itself , The bigger bulk it shows . Hence , bashful cunning ! And prompt me , plain and holy innocence ! I am your wife , if you will marry me ; If not , I 'll die your maid : to be your fellow You may deny me ; but I 'll be your servant , Whether you will or no .
FERDINAND : My mistress , dearest ; And I thus humble ever .
MIRANDA : My husband , then ?
FERDINAND : Ay , with a heart as willing As bondage e 'er of freedom : here 's my hand .
MIRANDA : And mine , with my heart in 't ; and now farewell Till half an hour hence .
FERDINAND : A thousand thousand !
PROSPERO : So glad of this as they I cannot be , Who are surprised withal ; but my rejoicing At nothing can be more . I 'll to my book , For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining . Exit Enter CALIBAN , STEPHANO , and TRINCULO
STEPHANO : Tell not me ; when the butt is out , we will drink water ; not a drop before : therefore bear up , and board ' em . Servant-monster , drink to me .
TRINCULO : Servant-monster ! the folly of this island ! They say there 's but five upon this isle : we are three of them ; if th ' other two be brained like us , the state totters .
