MIRANDA : ' Tis a villain , sir , I do not love to look on .
PROSPERO : But , as ' tis , We cannot miss him : he does make our fire , Fetch in our wood and serves in offices That profit us . What , ho ! slave ! Caliban ! Thou earth , thou ! speak .
CALIBAN : There 's wood enough within .
PROSPERO : Come forth , I say ! there 's other business for thee : Come , thou tortoise ! when ? Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph Fine apparition ! My quaint Ariel , Hark in thine ear .
ARIEL : My lord it shall be done . Exit
PROSPERO : Thou poisonous slave , got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam , come forth ! Enter CALIBAN
CALIBAN : As wicked dew as e 'er my mother brush 'd With raven 's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both ! a south-west blow on ye And blister you all o 'er !
PROSPERO : For this , be sure , to-night thou shalt have cramps , Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up ; urchins Shall , for that vast of night that they may work , All exercise on thee ; thou shalt be pinch 'd As thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging Than bees that made ' em .
CALIBAN : I must eat my dinner . This island 's mine , by Sycorax my mother , Which thou takest from me . When thou camest first , Thou strokedst me and madest much of me , wouldst give me Water with berries in 't , and teach me how To name the bigger light , and how the less , That burn by day and night : and then I loved thee And show 'd thee all the qualities o ' the isle , The fresh springs , brine-pits , barren place and fertile : Cursed be I that did so ! All the charms Of Sycorax , toads , beetles , bats , light on you ! For I am all the subjects that you have , Which first was mine own king : and here you sty me In this hard rock , whiles you do keep from me The rest o ' the island .
PROSPERO : Thou most lying slave , Whom stripes may move , not kindness ! I have used thee , Filth as thou art , with human care , and lodged thee In mine own cell , till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child .
CALIBAN : O ho , O ho ! would 't had been done ! Thou didst prevent me ; I had peopled else This isle with Calibans .
PROSPERO : Abhorred slave , Which any print of goodness wilt not take , Being capable of all ill ! I pitied thee , Took pains to make thee speak , taught thee each hour One thing or other : when thou didst not , savage , Know thine own meaning , but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish , I endow 'd thy purposes With words that made them known . But thy vile race , Though thou didst learn , had that in 't which good natures Could not abide to be with ; therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock , Who hadst deserved more than a prison .
CALIBAN : You taught me language ; and my profit on 't Is , I know how to curse . The red plague rid you For learning me your language !
PROSPERO : Hag-seed , hence ! Fetch us in fuel ; and be quick , thou 'rt best , To answer other business . Shrug 'st thou , malice ? If thou neglect 'st or dost unwillingly What I command , I 'll rack thee with old cramps , Fill all thy bones with aches , make thee roar That beasts shall tremble at thy din .
CALIBAN : No , pray thee . Aside I must obey : his art is of such power , It would control my dam 's god , Setebos , and make a vassal of him .
