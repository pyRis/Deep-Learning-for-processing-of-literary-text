PROSPERO : Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou Perform 'd , my Ariel ; a grace it had , devouring : Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated In what thou hadst to say : so , with good life And observation strange , my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done . My high charms work And these mine enemies are all knit up In their distractions ; they now are in my power ; And in these fits I leave them , while I visit Young Ferdinand , whom they suppose is drown 'd , And his and mine loved darling . Exit above
GONZALO : I ' the name of something holy , sir , why stand you In this strange stare ?
ALONSO : O , it is monstrous , monstrous : Methought the billows spoke and told me of it ; The winds did sing it to me , and the thunder , That deep and dreadful organ-pipe , pronounced The name of Prosper : it did bass my trespass . Therefore my son i ' the ooze is bedded , and I 'll seek him deeper than e 'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded . Exit
SEBASTIAN : But one fiend at a time , I 'll fight their legions o 'er .
ANTONIO : I 'll be thy second .
GONZALO : All three of them are desperate : their great guilt , Like poison given to work a great time after , Now ' gins to bite the spirits . I do beseech you That are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to .
ADRIAN : Follow , I pray you . Enter PROSPERO , FERDINAND , and MIRANDA
PROSPERO : If I have too austerely punish 'd you , Your compensation makes amends , for I Have given you here a third of mine own life , Or that for which I live ; who once again I tender to thy hand : all thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love and thou Hast strangely stood the test here , afore Heaven , I ratify this my rich gift . O Ferdinand , Do not smile at me that I boast her off , For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her .
FERDINAND : I do believe it Against an oracle .
PROSPERO : Then , as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased take my daughter : but If thou dost break her virgin-knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be minister 'd , No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow : but barren hate , Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both : therefore take heed , As Hymen 's lamps shall light you .
FERDINAND : As I hope For quiet days , fair issue and long life , With such love as ' tis now , the murkiest den , The most opportune place , the strong 'st suggestion . Our worser genius can , shall never melt Mine honour into lust , to take away The edge of that day 's celebration When I shall think : or Phoebus ' steeds are founder 'd , Or Night kept chain 'd below .
PROSPERO : Fairly spoke . Sit then and talk with her ; she is thine own . What , Ariel ! my industrious servant , Ariel ! Enter ARIEL
ARIEL : What would my potent master ? here I am .
PROSPERO : Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform ; and I must use you In such another trick . Go bring the rabble , O 'er whom I give thee power , here to this place : Incite them to quick motion ; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art : it is my promise , And they expect it from me .
ARIEL : Presently ?
PROSPERO : Ay , with a twink .
ARIEL : Before you can say ' come ' and ' go , ' And breathe twice and cry ' so , so , ' Each one , tripping on his toe , Will be here with mop and mow . Do you love me , master ? no ?
