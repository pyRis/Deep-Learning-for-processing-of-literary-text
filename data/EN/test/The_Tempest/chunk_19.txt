ARIEL : You are three men of sin , whom Destiny , That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in 't , the never-surfeited sea Hath caused to belch up you ; and on this island Where man doth not inhabit ; you ' mongst men Being most unfit to live . I have made you mad ; And even with such-like valour men hang and drown Their proper selves . ALONSO , SEBASTIAN & c. draw their swords You fools ! I and my fellows Are ministers of Fate : the elements , Of whom your swords are temper 'd , may as well Wound the loud winds , or with bemock 'd-at stabs Kill the still-closing waters , as diminish One dowle that 's in my plume : my fellow-ministers Are like invulnerable . If you could hurt , Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted . But remember-- For that 's my business to you--that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero ; Exposed unto the sea , which hath requit it , Him and his innocent child : for which foul deed The powers , delaying , not forgetting , have Incensed the seas and shores , yea , all the creatures , Against your peace . Thee of thy son , Alonso , They have bereft ; and do pronounce by me : Lingering perdition , worse than any death Can be at once , shall step by step attend You and your ways ; whose wraths to guard you from-- Which here , in this most desolate isle , else falls Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow And a clear life ensuing . He vanishes in thunder ; then , to soft music enter the Shapes again , and dance , with mocks and mows , and carrying out the table
PROSPERO : Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou Perform 'd , my Ariel ; a grace it had , devouring : Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated In what thou hadst to say : so , with good life And observation strange , my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done . My high charms work And these mine enemies are all knit up In their distractions ; they now are in my power ; And in these fits I leave them , while I visit Young Ferdinand , whom they suppose is drown 'd , And his and mine loved darling . Exit above
GONZALO : I ' the name of something holy , sir , why stand you In this strange stare ?
ALONSO : O , it is monstrous , monstrous : Methought the billows spoke and told me of it ; The winds did sing it to me , and the thunder , That deep and dreadful organ-pipe , pronounced The name of Prosper : it did bass my trespass . Therefore my son i ' the ooze is bedded , and I 'll seek him deeper than e 'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded . Exit
SEBASTIAN : But one fiend at a time , I 'll fight their legions o 'er .
ANTONIO : I 'll be thy second .
GONZALO : All three of them are desperate : their great guilt , Like poison given to work a great time after , Now ' gins to bite the spirits . I do beseech you That are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to .
ADRIAN : Follow , I pray you . Enter PROSPERO , FERDINAND , and MIRANDA
PROSPERO : If I have too austerely punish 'd you , Your compensation makes amends , for I Have given you here a third of mine own life , Or that for which I live ; who once again I tender to thy hand : all thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love and thou Hast strangely stood the test here , afore Heaven , I ratify this my rich gift . O Ferdinand , Do not smile at me that I boast her off , For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her .
FERDINAND : I do believe it Against an oracle .
PROSPERO : Then , as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased take my daughter : but If thou dost break her virgin-knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be minister 'd , No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow : but barren hate , Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both : therefore take heed , As Hymen 's lamps shall light you .
FERDINAND : As I hope For quiet days , fair issue and long life , With such love as ' tis now , the murkiest den , The most opportune place , the strong 'st suggestion . Our worser genius can , shall never melt Mine honour into lust , to take away The edge of that day 's celebration When I shall think : or Phoebus ' steeds are founder 'd , Or Night kept chain 'd below .
PROSPERO : Fairly spoke . Sit then and talk with her ; she is thine own . What , Ariel ! my industrious servant , Ariel ! Enter ARIEL
ARIEL : What would my potent master ? here I am .
PROSPERO : Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform ; and I must use you In such another trick . Go bring the rabble , O 'er whom I give thee power , here to this place : Incite them to quick motion ; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art : it is my promise , And they expect it from me .
ARIEL : Presently ?
PROSPERO : Ay , with a twink .
