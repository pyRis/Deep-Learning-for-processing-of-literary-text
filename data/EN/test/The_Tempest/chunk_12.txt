CALIBAN : All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs , fens , flats , on Prosper fall and make him By inch-meal a disease ! His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse . But they 'll nor pinch , Fright me with urchin--shows , pitch me i ' the mire , Nor lead me , like a firebrand , in the dark Out of my way , unless he bid ' em ; but For every trifle are they set upon me ; Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me And after bite me , then like hedgehogs which Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount Their pricks at my footfall ; sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness . Enter TRINCULO Lo , now , lo ! Here comes a spirit of his , and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly . I 'll fall flat ; Perchance he will not mind me .
TRINCULO : Here 's neither bush nor shrub , to bear off any weather at all , and another storm brewing ; I hear it sing i ' the wind : yond same black cloud , yond huge one , looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor . If it should thunder as it did before , I know not where to hide my head : yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls . What have we here ? a man or a fish ? dead or alive ? A fish : he smells like a fish ; a very ancient and fish- like smell ; a kind of not of the newest Poor- John . A strange fish ! Were I in England now , as once I was , and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver : there would this monster make a man ; any strange beast there makes a man : when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar , they will lazy out ten to see a dead Indian . Legged like a man and his fins like arms ! Warm o ' my troth ! I do now let loose my opinion ; hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander , that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt . Thunder Alas , the storm is come again ! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine ; there is no other shelter hereabouts : misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows . I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past . Enter STEPHANO , singing : a bottle in his hand
STEPHANO : I shall no more to sea , to sea , Here shall I die ashore-- This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man 's funeral : well , here 's my comfort . Drinks Sings The master , the swabber , the boatswain and I , The gunner and his mate Loved Mall , Meg and Marian and Margery , But none of us cared for Kate ; For she had a tongue with a tang , Would cry to a sailor , Go hang ! She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch , Yet a tailor might scratch her where 'er she did itch : Then to sea , boys , and let her go hang ! This is a scurvy tune too : but here 's my comfort . Drinks
CALIBAN : Do not torment me : Oh !
STEPHANO : What 's the matter ? Have we devils here ? Do you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind , ha ? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs ; for it hath been said , As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground ; and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at 's nostrils .
CALIBAN : The spirit torments me ; Oh !
