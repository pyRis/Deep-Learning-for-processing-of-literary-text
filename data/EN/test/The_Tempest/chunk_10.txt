ANTONIO : Nay , good my lord , be not angry .
GONZALO : No , I warrant you ; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly . Will you laugh me asleep , for I am very heavy ?
ANTONIO : Go sleep , and hear us . All sleep except ALONSO , SEBASTIAN , and ANTONIO
ALONSO : What , all so soon asleep ! I wish mine eyes Would , with themselves , shut up my thoughts : I find They are inclined to do so .
SEBASTIAN : Please you , sir , Do not omit the heavy offer of it : It seldom visits sorrow ; when it doth , It is a comforter .
ANTONIO : We two , my lord , Will guard your person while you take your rest , And watch your safety .
ALONSO : Thank you . Wondrous heavy . ALONSO sleeps . Exit ARIEL
SEBASTIAN : What a strange drowsiness possesses them !
ANTONIO : It is the quality o ' the climate .
SEBASTIAN : Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink ? I find not Myself disposed to sleep .
ANTONIO : Nor I ; my spirits are nimble . They fell together all , as by consent ; They dropp 'd , as by a thunder-stroke . What might , Worthy Sebastian ? O , what might ? --No more : -- And yet me thinks I see it in thy face , What thou shouldst be : the occasion speaks thee , and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head .
SEBASTIAN : What , art thou waking ?
ANTONIO : Do you not hear me speak ?
SEBASTIAN : I do ; and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak 'st Out of thy sleep . What is it thou didst say ? This is a strange repose , to be asleep With eyes wide open ; standing , speaking , moving , And yet so fast asleep .
ANTONIO : Noble Sebastian , Thou let 'st thy fortune sleep--die , rather ; wink 'st Whiles thou art waking .
SEBASTIAN : Thou dost snore distinctly ; There 's meaning in thy snores .
ANTONIO : I am more serious than my custom : you Must be so too , if heed me ; which to do Trebles thee o 'er .
SEBASTIAN : Well , I am standing water .
ANTONIO : I 'll teach you how to flow .
SEBASTIAN : Do so : to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me .
ANTONIO : O , If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it ! how , in stripping it , You more invest it ! Ebbing men , indeed , Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth .
SEBASTIAN : Prithee , say on : The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee , and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield .
ANTONIO : Thus , sir : Although this lord of weak remembrance , this , Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth 'd , hath here almost persuade , -- For he 's a spirit of persuasion , only Professes to persuade , --the king his son 's alive , ' Tis as impossible that he 's undrown 'd And he that sleeps here swims .
SEBASTIAN : I have no hope That he 's undrown 'd .
ANTONIO : O , out of that ' no hope ' What great hope have you ! no hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond , But doubt discovery there . Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drown 'd ?
SEBASTIAN : He 's gone .
ANTONIO : Then , tell me , Who 's the next heir of Naples ?
SEBASTIAN : Claribel .
ANTONIO : She that is queen of Tunis ; she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man 's life ; she that from Naples Can have no note , unless the sun were post-- The man i ' the moon 's too slow--till new-born chins Be rough and razorable ; she that--from whom ? We all were sea-swallow 'd , though some cast again , And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what 's past is prologue , what to come In yours and my discharge .
