PROSPERO : In this last tempest . I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth , their words Are natural breath : but , howsoe 'er you have Been justled from your senses , know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan , who most strangely Upon this shore , where you were wreck 'd , was landed , To be the lord on 't . No more yet of this ; For ' tis a chronicle of day by day , Not a relation for a breakfast nor Befitting this first meeting . Welcome , sir ; This cell 's my court : here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad : pray you , look in . My dukedom since you have given me again , I will requite you with as good a thing ; At least bring forth a wonder , to content ye As much as me my dukedom . Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess
MIRANDA : Sweet lord , you play me false .
FERDINAND : No , my dear 'st love , I would not for the world .
MIRANDA : Yes , for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle , And I would call it , fair play .
ALONSO : If this prove A vision of the Island , one dear son Shall I twice lose .
SEBASTIAN : A most high miracle !
FERDINAND : Though the seas threaten , they are merciful ; I have cursed them without cause . Kneels
ALONSO : Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about ! Arise , and say how thou camest here .
MIRANDA : O , wonder ! How many goodly creatures are there here ! How beauteous mankind is ! O brave new world , That has such people in 't !
PROSPERO : ' Tis new to thee .
ALONSO : What is this maid with whom thou wast at play ? Your eld 'st acquaintance cannot be three hours : Is she the goddess that hath sever 'd us , And brought us thus together ?
FERDINAND : Sir , she is mortal ; But by immortal Providence she 's mine : I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice , nor thought I had one . She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan , Of whom so often I have heard renown , But never saw before ; of whom I have Received a second life ; and second father This lady makes him to me .
ALONSO : I am hers : But , O , how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness !
PROSPERO : There , sir , stop : Let us not burthen our remembrance with A heaviness that 's gone .
GONZALO : I have inly wept , Or should have spoke ere this . Look down , you god , And on this couple drop a blessed crown ! For it is you that have chalk 'd forth the way Which brought us hither .
ALONSO : I say , Amen , Gonzalo !
GONZALO : Was Milan thrust from Milan , that his issue Should become kings of Naples ? O , rejoice Beyond a common joy , and set it down With gold on lasting pillars : In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis , And Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife Where he himself was lost , Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle and all of us ourselves When no man was his own .
ALONSO : Give me your hands : Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy !
GONZALO : Be it so ! Amen ! Re-enter ARIEL , with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following O , look , sir , look , sir ! here is more of us : I prophesied , if a gallows were on land , This fellow could not drown . Now , blasphemy , That swear 'st grace o 'erboard , not an oath on shore ? Hast thou no mouth by land ? What is the news ?
Boatswain : The best news is , that we have safely found Our king and company ; the next , our ship-- Which , but three glasses since , we gave out split-- Is tight and yare and bravely rigg 'd as when We first put out to sea .
ARIEL : Sir , all this service Have I done since I went .
PROSPERO : My tricksy spirit !
ALONSO : These are not natural events ; they strengthen From strange to stranger . Say , how came you hither ?
Boatswain : If I did think , sir , I were well awake , I 'ld strive to tell you . We were dead of sleep , And--how we know not--all clapp 'd under hatches ; Where but even now with strange and several noises Of roaring , shrieking , howling , jingling chains , And more diversity of sounds , all horrible , We were awaked ; straightway , at liberty ; Where we , in all her trim , freshly beheld Our royal , good and gallant ship , our master Capering to eye her : on a trice , so please you , Even in a dream , were we divided from them And were brought moping hither .
