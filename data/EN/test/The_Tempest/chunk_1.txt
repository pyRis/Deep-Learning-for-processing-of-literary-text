PROSPERO : Be collected : No more amazement : tell your piteous heart There 's no harm done .
MIRANDA : O , woe the day !
PROSPERO : No harm . I have done nothing but in care of thee , Of thee , my dear one , thee , my daughter , who Art ignorant of what thou art , nought knowing Of whence I am , nor that I am more better Than Prospero , master of a full poor cell , And thy no greater father .
MIRANDA : More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts .
PROSPERO : ' Tis time I should inform thee farther . Lend thy hand , And pluck my magic garment from me . So : Lays down his mantle Lie there , my art . Wipe thou thine eyes ; have comfort . The direful spectacle of the wreck , which touch 'd The very virtue of compassion in thee , I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul-- No , not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard 'st cry , which thou saw 'st sink . Sit down ; For thou must now know farther .
MIRANDA : You have often Begun to tell me what I am , but stopp 'd And left me to a bootless inquisition , Concluding ' Stay : not yet . ' 
PROSPERO : The hour 's now come ; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear ; Obey and be attentive . Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell ? I do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not Out three years old .
MIRANDA : Certainly , sir , I can .
PROSPERO : By what ? by any other house or person ? Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance .
MIRANDA : ' Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants . Had I not Four or five women once that tended me ?
PROSPERO : Thou hadst , and more , Miranda . But how is it That this lives in thy mind ? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time ? If thou remember 'st aught ere thou camest here , How thou camest here thou mayst .
MIRANDA : But that I do not .
PROSPERO : Twelve year since , Miranda , twelve year since , Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power .
MIRANDA : Sir , are not you my father ?
PROSPERO : Thy mother was a piece of virtue , and She said thou wast my daughter ; and thy father Was Duke of Milan ; and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued .
MIRANDA : O the heavens ! What foul play had we , that we came from thence ? Or blessed was 't we did ?
PROSPERO : Both , both , my girl : By foul play , as thou say 'st , were we heaved thence , But blessedly holp hither .
MIRANDA : O , my heart bleeds To think o ' the teen that I have turn 'd you to , Which is from my remembrance ! Please you , farther .
PROSPERO : My brother and thy uncle , call 'd Antonio-- I pray thee , mark me--that a brother should Be so perfidious ! --he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state ; as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke , being so reputed In dignity , and for the liberal arts Without a parallel ; those being all my study , The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger , being transported And rapt in secret studies . Thy false uncle-- Dost thou attend me ?
MIRANDA : Sir , most heedfully .
