ALONSO : Old lord , I cannot blame thee , Who am myself attach 'd with weariness , To the dulling of my spirits : sit down , and rest . Even here I will put off my hope and keep it No longer for my flatterer : he is drown 'd Whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land . Well , let him go .
ANTONIO : I am right glad that he 's so out of hope . Do not , for one repulse , forego the purpose That you resolved to effect .
SEBASTIAN : The next advantage Will we take throughly .
ANTONIO : Let it be to-night ; For , now they are oppress 'd with travel , they Will not , nor cannot , use such vigilance As when they are fresh .
SEBASTIAN : I say , to-night : no more . Solemn and strange music
ALONSO : What harmony is this ? My good friends , hark !
GONZALO : Marvellous sweet music ! Enter PROSPERO above , invisible . Enter several strange Shapes , bringing in a banquet ; they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation ; and , inviting the King , & c. to eat , they depart
ALONSO : Give us kind keepers , heavens ! What were these ?
SEBASTIAN : A living drollery . Now I will believe That there are unicorns , that in Arabia There is one tree , the phoenix ' throne , one phoenix At this hour reigning there .
ANTONIO : I 'll believe both ; And what does else want credit , come to me , And I 'll be sworn ' tis true : travellers ne 'er did lie , Though fools at home condemn ' em .
GONZALO : If in Naples I should report this now , would they believe me ? If I should say , I saw such islanders-- For , certes , these are people of the island-- Who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet , note , Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many , nay , almost any .
PROSPERO : Honest lord , Thou hast said well ; for some of you there present Are worse than devils .
ALONSO : I cannot too much muse Such shapes , such gesture and such sound , expressing , Although they want the use of tongue , a kind Of excellent dumb discourse .
PROSPERO : Praise in departing .
FRANCISCO : They vanish 'd strangely .
SEBASTIAN : No matter , since They have left their viands behind ; for we have stomachs . Will 't please you taste of what is here ?
ALONSO : Not I.
GONZALO : Faith , sir , you need not fear . When we were boys , Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dew-lapp 'd like bulls , whose throats had hanging at ' em Wallets of flesh ? or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts ? which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of .
ALONSO : I will stand to and feed , Although my last : no matter , since I feel The best is past . Brother , my lord the duke , Stand to and do as we . Thunder and lightning . Enter ARIEL , like a harpy ; claps his wings upon the table ; and , with a quaint device , the banquet vanishes
