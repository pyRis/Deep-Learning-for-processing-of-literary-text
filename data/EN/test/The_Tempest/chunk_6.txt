FERDINAND : Where should this music be ? i ' the air or the earth ? It sounds no more : and sure , it waits upon Some god o ' the island . Sitting on a bank , Weeping again the king my father 's wreck , This music crept by me upon the waters , Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air : thence I have follow 'd it , Or it hath drawn me rather . But ' tis gone . No , it begins again . ARIEL sings Full fathom five thy father lies ; Of his bones are coral made ; Those are pearls that were his eyes : Nothing of him that doth fade But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange . Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell Burthen Ding-dong Hark ! now I hear them , --Ding-dong , bell .
FERDINAND : The ditty does remember my drown 'd father . This is no mortal business , nor no sound That the earth owes . I hear it now above me .
PROSPERO : The fringed curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond .
MIRANDA : What is 't ? a spirit ? Lord , how it looks about ! Believe me , sir , It carries a brave form . But ' tis a spirit .
PROSPERO : No , wench ; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have , such . This gallant which thou seest Was in the wreck ; and , but he 's something stain 'd With grief that 's beauty 's canker , thou mightst call him A goodly person : he hath lost his fellows And strays about to find ' em .
MIRANDA : I might call him A thing divine , for nothing natural I ever saw so noble .
PROSPERO : It goes on , I see , As my soul prompts it . Spirit , fine spirit ! I 'll free thee Within two days for this .
FERDINAND : Most sure , the goddess On whom these airs attend ! Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island ; And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here : my prime request , Which I do last pronounce , is , O you wonder ! If you be maid or no ?
MIRANDA : No wonder , sir ; But certainly a maid .
FERDINAND : My language ! heavens ! I am the best of them that speak this speech , Were I but where ' tis spoken .
PROSPERO : How ? the best ? What wert thou , if the King of Naples heard thee ?
FERDINAND : A single thing , as I am now , that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples . He does hear me ; And that he does I weep : myself am Naples , Who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld The king my father wreck 'd .
MIRANDA : Alack , for mercy !
FERDINAND : Yes , faith , and all his lords ; the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain .
PROSPERO : The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee , If now ' twere fit to do 't . At the first sight They have changed eyes . Delicate Ariel , I 'll set thee free for this . To FERDINAND A word , good sir ; I fear you have done yourself some wrong : a word .
MIRANDA : Why speaks my father so ungently ? This Is the third man that e 'er I saw , the first That e 'er I sigh 'd for : pity move my father To be inclined my way !
FERDINAND : O , if a virgin , And your affection not gone forth , I 'll make you The queen of Naples .
PROSPERO : Soft , sir ! one word more . Aside They are both in either 's powers ; but this swift business I must uneasy make , lest too light winning Make the prize light . To FERDINAND One word more ; I charge thee That thou attend me : thou dost here usurp The name thou owest not ; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy , to win it From me , the lord on 't .
