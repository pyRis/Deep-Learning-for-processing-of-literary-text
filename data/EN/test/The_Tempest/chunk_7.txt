FERDINAND : No , as I am a man .
MIRANDA : There 's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple : If the ill spirit have so fair a house , Good things will strive to dwell with 't .
PROSPERO : Follow me . Speak not you for him ; he 's a traitor . Come ; I 'll manacle thy neck and feet together : Sea-water shalt thou drink ; thy food shall be The fresh-brook muscles , wither 'd roots and husks Wherein the acorn cradled . Follow .
FERDINAND : No ; I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power . Draws , and is charmed from moving
MIRANDA : O dear father , Make not too rash a trial of him , for He 's gentle and not fearful .
PROSPERO : What ? I say , My foot my tutor ? Put thy sword up , traitor ; Who makest a show but darest not strike , thy conscience Is so possess 'd with guilt : come from thy ward , For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop .
MIRANDA : Beseech you , father .
PROSPERO : Hence ! hang not on my garments .
MIRANDA : Sir , have pity ; I 'll be his surety .
PROSPERO : Silence ! one word more Shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee . What ! An advocate for an imposter ! hush ! Thou think 'st there is no more such shapes as he , Having seen but him and Caliban : foolish wench ! To the most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels .
MIRANDA : My affections Are then most humble ; I have no ambition To see a goodlier man .
PROSPERO : Come on ; obey : Thy nerves are in their infancy again And have no vigour in them .
FERDINAND : So they are ; My spirits , as in a dream , are all bound up . My father 's loss , the weakness which I feel , The wreck of all my friends , nor this man 's threats , To whom I am subdued , are but light to me , Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid : all corners else o ' the earth Let liberty make use of ; space enough Have I in such a prison .
PROSPERO : It works . To FERDINAND Come on . Thou hast done well , fine Ariel ! To FERDINAND Follow me . To ARIEL Hark what thou else shalt do me .
MIRANDA : Be of comfort ; My father 's of a better nature , sir , Than he appears by speech : this is unwonted Which now came from him .
PROSPERO : Thou shalt be free As mountain winds : but then exactly do All points of my command .
ARIEL : To the syllable .
PROSPERO : Come , follow . Speak not for him . Enter ALONSO , SEBASTIAN , ANTONIO , GONZALO , ADRIAN , FRANCISCO , and others
GONZALO : Beseech you , sir , be merry ; you have cause , So have we all , of joy ; for our escape Is much beyond our loss . Our hint of woe Is common ; every day some sailor 's wife , The masters of some merchant and the merchant Have just our theme of woe ; but for the miracle , I mean our preservation , few in millions Can speak like us : then wisely , good sir , weigh Our sorrow with our comfort .
ALONSO : Prithee , peace .
SEBASTIAN : He receives comfort like cold porridge .
ANTONIO : The visitor will not give him o 'er so .
SEBASTIAN : Look he 's winding up the watch of his wit ; by and by it will strike .
GONZALO : Sir , --
SEBASTIAN : One : tell .
GONZALO : When every grief is entertain 'd that 's offer 'd , Comes to the entertainer--
SEBASTIAN : A dollar .
GONZALO : Dolour comes to him , indeed : you have spoken truer than you purposed .
SEBASTIAN : You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should .
GONZALO : Therefore , my lord , --
ANTONIO : Fie , what a spendthrift is he of his tongue !
ALONSO : I prithee , spare .
