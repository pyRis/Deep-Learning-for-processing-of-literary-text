MIRANDA : O , good sir , I do .
PROSPERO : I pray thee , mark me . I , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which , but by being so retired , O 'er-prized all popular rate , in my false brother Awaked an evil nature ; and my trust , Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was ; which had indeed no limit , A confidence sans bound . He being thus lorded , Not only with what my revenue yielded , But what my power might else exact , like one Who having into truth , by telling of it , Made such a sinner of his memory , To credit his own lie , he did believe He was indeed the duke ; out o ' the substitution And executing the outward face of royalty , With all prerogative : hence his ambition growing-- Dost thou hear ?
MIRANDA : Your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
PROSPERO : To have no screen between this part he play 'd And him he play 'd it for , he needs will be Absolute Milan . Me , poor man , my library Was dukedom large enough : of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable ; confederates-- So dry he was for sway--wi ' the King of Naples To give him annual tribute , do him homage , Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbow 'd--alas , poor Milan ! -- To most ignoble stooping .
MIRANDA : O the heavens !
PROSPERO : Mark his condition and the event ; then tell me If this might be a brother .
MIRANDA : I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother : Good wombs have borne bad sons .
PROSPERO : Now the condition . The King of Naples , being an enemy To me inveterate , hearkens my brother 's suit ; Which was , that he , in lieu o ' the premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute , Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honours on my brother : whereon , A treacherous army levied , one midnight Fated to the purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan , and , i ' the dead of darkness , The ministers for the purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self .
MIRANDA : Alack , for pity ! I , not remembering how I cried out then , Will cry it o 'er again : it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to 't .
PROSPERO : Hear a little further And then I 'll bring thee to the present business Which now 's upon 's ; without the which this story Were most impertinent .
MIRANDA : Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us ?
PROSPERO : Well demanded , wench : My tale provokes that question . Dear , they durst not , So dear the love my people bore me , nor set A mark so bloody on the business , but With colours fairer painted their foul ends . In few , they hurried us aboard a bark , Bore us some leagues to sea ; where they prepared A rotten carcass of a boat , not rigg 'd , Nor tackle , sail , nor mast ; the very rats Instinctively had quit it : there they hoist us , To cry to the sea that roar 'd to us , to sigh To the winds whose pity , sighing back again , Did us but loving wrong .
MIRANDA : Alack , what trouble Was I then to you !
PROSPERO : O , a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me . Thou didst smile . Infused with a fortitude from heaven , When I have deck 'd the sea with drops full salt , Under my burthen groan 'd ; which raised in me An undergoing stomach , to bear up Against what should ensue .
MIRANDA : How came we ashore ?
