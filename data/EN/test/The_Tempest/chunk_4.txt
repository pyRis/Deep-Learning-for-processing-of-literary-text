PROSPERO : At least two glasses . The time ' twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously .
ARIEL : Is there more toil ? Since thou dost give me pains , Let me remember thee what thou hast promised , Which is not yet perform 'd me .
PROSPERO : How now ? moody ? What is 't thou canst demand ?
ARIEL : My liberty .
PROSPERO : Before the time be out ? no more !
ARIEL : I prithee , Remember I have done thee worthy service ; Told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served Without or grudge or grumblings : thou didst promise To bate me a full year .
PROSPERO : Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee ?
ARIEL : No .
PROSPERO : Thou dost , and think 'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o ' the earth When it is baked with frost .
ARIEL : I do not , sir .
PROSPERO : Thou liest , malignant thing ! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax , who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop ? hast thou forgot her ?
ARIEL : No , sir .
PROSPERO : Thou hast . Where was she born ? speak ; tell me .
ARIEL : Sir , in Argier .
PROSPERO : O , was she so ? I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been , Which thou forget 'st . This damn 'd witch Sycorax , For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing , from Argier , Thou know 'st , was banish 'd : for one thing she did They would not take her life . Is not this true ?
ARIEL : Ay , sir .
PROSPERO : This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by the sailors . Thou , my slave , As thou report 'st thyself , wast then her servant ; And , for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr 'd commands , Refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage , Into a cloven pine ; within which rift Imprison 'd thou didst painfully remain A dozen years ; within which space she died And left thee there ; where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill-wheels strike . Then was this island-- Save for the son that she did litter here , A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour 'd with A human shape .
ARIEL : Yes , Caliban her son .
PROSPERO : Dull thing , I say so ; he , that Caliban Whom now I keep in service . Thou best know 'st What torment I did find thee in ; thy groans Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts Of ever angry bears : it was a torment To lay upon the damn 'd , which Sycorax Could not again undo : it was mine art , When I arrived and heard thee , that made gape The pine and let thee out .
ARIEL : I thank thee , master .
PROSPERO : If thou more murmur 'st , I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howl 'd away twelve winters .
ARIEL : Pardon , master ; I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently .
PROSPERO : Do so , and after two days I will discharge thee .
ARIEL : That 's my noble master ! What shall I do ? say what ; what shall I do ?
PROSPERO : Go make thyself like a nymph o ' the sea : be subject To no sight but thine and mine , invisible To every eyeball else . Go take this shape And hither come in 't : go , hence with diligence ! Exit ARIEL Awake , dear heart , awake ! thou hast slept well ; Awake !
MIRANDA : The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me .
PROSPERO : Shake it off . Come on ; We 'll visit Caliban my slave , who never Yields us kind answer .
