STEPHANO : There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that , monster , but an infinite loss .
TRINCULO : That 's more to me than my wetting : yet this is your harmless fairy , monster .
STEPHANO : I will fetch off my bottle , though I be o 'er ears for my labour .
CALIBAN : Prithee , my king , be quiet . Seest thou here , This is the mouth o ' the cell : no noise , and enter . Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever , and I , thy Caliban , For aye thy foot-licker .
STEPHANO : Give me thy hand . I do begin to have bloody thoughts .
TRINCULO : O king Stephano ! O peer ! O worthy Stephano ! look what a wardrobe here is for thee !
CALIBAN : Let it alone , thou fool ; it is but trash .
TRINCULO : O , ho , monster ! we know what belongs to a frippery . O king Stephano !
STEPHANO : Put off that gown , Trinculo ; by this hand , I 'll have that gown .
TRINCULO : Thy grace shall have it .
CALIBAN : The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean To dote thus on such luggage ? Let 's alone And do the murder first : if he awake , From toe to crown he 'll fill our skins with pinches , Make us strange stuff .
STEPHANO : Be you quiet , monster . Mistress line , is not this my jerkin ? Now is the jerkin under the line : now , jerkin , you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin .
TRINCULO : Do , do : we steal by line and level , an 't like your grace .
STEPHANO : I thank thee for that jest ; here 's a garment for 't : wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country . ' Steal by line and level ' is an excellent pass of pate ; there 's another garment for 't .
TRINCULO : Monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest .
CALIBAN : I will have none on 't : we shall lose our time , And all be turn 'd to barnacles , or to apes With foreheads villanous low .
STEPHANO : Monster , lay-to your fingers : help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or I 'll turn you out of my kingdom : go to , carry this .
TRINCULO : And this .
STEPHANO : Ay , and this . A noise of hunters heard . Enter divers Spirits , in shape of dogs and hounds , and hunt them about , PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on
PROSPERO : Hey , Mountain , hey !
ARIEL : Silver I there it goes , Silver !
PROSPERO : Fury , Fury ! there , Tyrant , there ! hark ! hark ! CALIBAN , STEPHANO , and TRINCULO , are driven out Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions , shorten up their sinews With aged cramps , and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o ' mountain .
ARIEL : Hark , they roar !
PROSPERO : Let them be hunted soundly . At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies : Shortly shall all my labours end , and thou Shalt have the air at freedom : for a little Follow , and do me service . Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes , and ARIEL
PROSPERO : Now does my project gather to a head : My charms crack not ; my spirits obey ; and time Goes upright with his carriage . How 's the day ?
ARIEL : On the sixth hour ; at which time , my lord , You said our work should cease .
PROSPERO : I did say so , When first I raised the tempest . Say , my spirit , How fares the king and 's followers ?
