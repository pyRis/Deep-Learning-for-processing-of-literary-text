MIRANDA : Would I might But ever see that man !
PROSPERO : Now I arise : Resumes his mantle Sit still , and hear the last of our sea-sorrow . Here in this island we arrived ; and here Have I , thy schoolmaster , made thee more profit Than other princesses can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful .
MIRANDA : Heavens thank you for 't ! And now , I pray you , sir , For still ' tis beating in my mind , your reason For raising this sea-storm ?
PROSPERO : Know thus far forth . By accident most strange , bountiful Fortune , Now my dear lady , hath mine enemies Brought to this shore ; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star , whose influence If now I court not but omit , my fortunes Will ever after droop . Here cease more questions : Thou art inclined to sleep ; ' tis a good dulness , And give it way : I know thou canst not choose . MIRANDA sleeps Come away , servant , come . I am ready now . Approach , my Ariel , come . Enter ARIEL
ARIEL : All hail , great master ! grave sir , hail ! I come To answer thy best pleasure ; be 't to fly , To swim , to dive into the fire , to ride On the curl 'd clouds , to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality .
PROSPERO : Hast thou , spirit , Perform 'd to point the tempest that I bade thee ?
ARIEL : To every article . I boarded the king 's ship ; now on the beak , Now in the waist , the deck , in every cabin , I flamed amazement : sometime I 'ld divide , And burn in many places ; on the topmast , The yards and bowsprit , would I flame distinctly , Then meet and join . Jove 's lightnings , the precursors O ' the dreadful thunder-claps , more momentary And sight-outrunning were not ; the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble , Yea , his dread trident shake .
PROSPERO : My brave spirit ! Who was so firm , so constant , that this coil Would not infect his reason ?
ARIEL : Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and play 'd Some tricks of desperation . All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , Then all afire with me : the king 's son , Ferdinand , With hair up-staring , --then like reeds , not hair , -- Was the first man that leap 'd ; cried , ' Hell is empty And all the devils are here . ' 
PROSPERO : Why that 's my spirit ! But was not this nigh shore ?
ARIEL : Close by , my master .
PROSPERO : But are they , Ariel , safe ?
ARIEL : Not a hair perish 'd ; On their sustaining garments not a blemish , But fresher than before : and , as thou badest me , In troops I have dispersed them ' bout the isle . The king 's son have I landed by himself ; Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting , His arms in this sad knot .
PROSPERO : Of the king 's ship The mariners say how thou hast disposed And all the rest o ' the fleet .
ARIEL : Safely in harbour Is the king 's ship ; in the deep nook , where once Thou call 'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vex 'd Bermoothes , there she 's hid : The mariners all under hatches stow 'd ; Who , with a charm join 'd to their suffer 'd labour , I have left asleep ; and for the rest o ' the fleet Which I dispersed , they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean flote , Bound sadly home for Naples , Supposing that they saw the king 's ship wreck 'd And his great person perish .
PROSPERO : Ariel , thy charge Exactly is perform 'd : but there 's more work . What is the time o ' the day ?
