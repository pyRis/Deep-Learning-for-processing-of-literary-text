ARIEL : Was 't well done ?
PROSPERO : Bravely , my diligence . Thou shalt be free .
ALONSO : This is as strange a maze as e 'er men trod And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of : some oracle Must rectify our knowledge .
PROSPERO : Sir , my liege , Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business ; at pick 'd leisure Which shall be shortly , single I 'll resolve you , Which to you shall seem probable , of every These happen 'd accidents ; till when , be cheerful And think of each thing well . Aside to ARIEL Come hither , spirit : Set Caliban and his companions free ; Untie the spell . Exit ARIEL How fares my gracious sir ? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not . Re-enter ARIEL , driving in CALIBAN , STEPHANO and TRINCULO , in their stolen apparel
STEPHANO : Every man shift for all the rest , and let no man take care for himself ; for all is but fortune . Coragio , bully-monster , coragio !
TRINCULO : If these be true spies which I wear in my head , here 's a goodly sight .
CALIBAN : O Setebos , these be brave spirits indeed ! How fine my master is ! I am afraid He will chastise me .
SEBASTIAN : Ha , ha ! What things are these , my lord Antonio ? Will money buy ' em ?
ANTONIO : Very like ; one of them Is a plain fish , and , no doubt , marketable .
PROSPERO : Mark but the badges of these men , my lords , Then say if they be true . This mis-shapen knave , His mother was a witch , and one so strong That could control the moon , make flows and ebbs , And deal in her command without her power . These three have robb 'd me ; and this demi-devil-- For he 's a bastard one--had plotted with them To take my life . Two of these fellows you Must know and own ; this thing of darkness ! Acknowledge mine .
CALIBAN : I shall be pinch 'd to death .
ALONSO : Is not this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
SEBASTIAN : He is drunk now : where had he wine ?
ALONSO : And Trinculo is reeling ripe : where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ' em ? How camest thou in this pickle ?
TRINCULO : I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that , I fear me , will never out of my bones : I shall not fear fly-blowing .
SEBASTIAN : Why , how now , Stephano !
STEPHANO : O , touch me not ; I am not Stephano , but a cramp .
PROSPERO : You 'ld be king o ' the isle , sirrah ?
STEPHANO : I should have been a sore one then .
ALONSO : This is a strange thing as e 'er I look 'd on . Pointing to Caliban
PROSPERO : He is as disproportion 'd in his manners As in his shape . Go , sirrah , to my cell ; Take with you your companions ; as you look To have my pardon , trim it handsomely .
CALIBAN : Ay , that I will ; and I 'll be wise hereafter And seek for grace . What a thrice-double ass Was I , to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool !
PROSPERO : Go to ; away !
ALONSO : Hence , and bestow your luggage where you found it .
SEBASTIAN : Or stole it , rather .
PROSPERO : Sir , I invite your highness and your train To my poor cell , where you shall take your rest For this one night ; which , part of it , I 'll waste With such discourse as , I not doubt , shall make it Go quick away ; the story of my life And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle : and in the morn I 'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples , Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-beloved solemnized ; And thence retire me to my Milan , where Every third thought shall be my grave .
