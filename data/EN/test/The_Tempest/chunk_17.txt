CALIBAN : Ha , ha , ha !
STEPHANO : Now , forward with your tale . Prithee , stand farther off .
CALIBAN : Beat him enough : after a little time I 'll beat him too .
STEPHANO : Stand farther . Come , proceed .
CALIBAN : Why , as I told thee , ' tis a custom with him , I ' th ' afternoon to sleep : there thou mayst brain him , Having first seized his books , or with a log Batter his skull , or paunch him with a stake , Or cut his wezand with thy knife . Remember First to possess his books ; for without them He 's but a sot , as I am , nor hath not One spirit to command : they all do hate him As rootedly as I. Burn but his books . He has brave utensils , --for so he calls them-- Which when he has a house , he 'll deck withal And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter ; he himself Calls her a nonpareil : I never saw a woman , But only Sycorax my dam and she ; But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great 'st does least .
STEPHANO : Is it so brave a lass ?
CALIBAN : Ay , lord ; she will become thy bed , I warrant . And bring thee forth brave brood .
STEPHANO : Monster , I will kill this man : his daughter and I will be king and queen--save our graces ! --and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys . Dost thou like the plot , Trinculo ?
TRINCULO : Excellent .
STEPHANO : Give me thy hand : I am sorry I beat thee ; but , while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head .
CALIBAN : Within this half hour will he be asleep : Wilt thou destroy him then ?
STEPHANO : Ay , on mine honour .
ARIEL : This will I tell my master .
CALIBAN : Thou makest me merry ; I am full of pleasure : Let us be jocund : will you troll the catch You taught me but while-ere ?
STEPHANO : At thy request , monster , I will do reason , any reason . Come on , Trinculo , let us sing . Sings Flout ' em and scout ' em And scout ' em and flout ' em Thought is free .
CALIBAN : That 's not the tune . Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
STEPHANO : What is this same ?
TRINCULO : This is the tune of our catch , played by the picture of Nobody .
STEPHANO : If thou beest a man , show thyself in thy likeness : if thou beest a devil , take 't as thou list .
TRINCULO : O , forgive me my sins !
STEPHANO : He that dies pays all debts : I defy thee . Mercy upon us !
CALIBAN : Art thou afeard ?
STEPHANO : No , monster , not I.
CALIBAN : Be not afeard ; the isle is full of noises , Sounds and sweet airs , that give delight and hurt not . Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears , and sometime voices That , if I then had waked after long sleep , Will make me sleep again : and then , in dreaming , The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me that , when I waked , I cried to dream again .
STEPHANO : This will prove a brave kingdom to me , where I shall have my music for nothing .
CALIBAN : When Prospero is destroyed .
STEPHANO : That shall be by and by : I remember the story .
TRINCULO : The sound is going away ; let 's follow it , and after do our work .
STEPHANO : Lead , monster ; we 'll follow . I would I could see this tabourer ; he lays it on .
TRINCULO : Wilt come ? I 'll follow , Stephano . Enter ALONSO , SEBASTIAN , ANTONIO , GONZALO , ADRIAN , FRANCISCO , and others
GONZALO : By 'r lakin , I can go no further , sir ; My old bones ache : here 's a maze trod indeed Through forth-rights and meanders ! By your patience , I needs must rest me .
