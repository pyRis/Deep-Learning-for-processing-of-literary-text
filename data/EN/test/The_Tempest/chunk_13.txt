CALIBAN : Do not torment me , prithee ; I 'll bring my wood home faster .
STEPHANO : He 's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest . He shall taste of my bottle : if he have never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his fit . If I can recover him and keep him tame , I will not take too much for him ; he shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly .
CALIBAN : Thou dost me yet but little hurt ; thou wilt anon , I know it by thy trembling : now Prosper works upon thee .
STEPHANO : Come on your ways ; open your mouth ; here is that which will give language to you , cat : open your mouth ; this will shake your shaking , I can tell you , and that soundly : you cannot tell who 's your friend : open your chaps again .
TRINCULO : I should know that voice : it should be--but he is drowned ; and these are devils : O defend me !
STEPHANO : Four legs and two voices : a most delicate monster ! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend ; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract . If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague . Come . Amen ! I will pour some in thy other mouth .
TRINCULO : Stephano !
STEPHANO : Doth thy other mouth call me ? Mercy , mercy ! This is a devil , and no monster : I will leave him ; I have no long spoon .
TRINCULO : Stephano ! If thou beest Stephano , touch me and speak to me : for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy good friend Trinculo .
STEPHANO : If thou beest Trinculo , come forth : I 'll pull thee by the lesser legs : if any be Trinculo 's legs , these are they . Thou art very Trinculo indeed ! How camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf ? can he vent Trinculos ?
TRINCULO : I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke . But art thou not drowned , Stephano ? I hope now thou art not drowned . Is the storm overblown ? I hid me under the dead moon-calf 's gaberdine for fear of the storm . And art thou living , Stephano ? O Stephano , two Neapolitans ' scaped !
STEPHANO : Prithee , do not turn me about ; my stomach is not constant .
CALIBAN : These be fine things , an if they be not sprites . That 's a brave god and bears celestial liquor . I will kneel to him .
STEPHANO : How didst thou ' scape ? How camest thou hither ? swear by this bottle how thou camest hither . I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o 'erboard , by this bottle ; which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore .
CALIBAN : I 'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject ; for the liquor is not earthly .
STEPHANO : Here ; swear then how thou escapedst .
TRINCULO : Swum ashore. man , like a duck : I can swim like a duck , I 'll be sworn .
STEPHANO : Here , kiss the book . Though thou canst swim like a duck , thou art made like a goose .
TRINCULO : O Stephano. hast any more of this ?
STEPHANO : The whole butt , man : my cellar is in a rock by the sea-side where my wine is hid . How now , moon-calf ! how does thine ague ?
CALIBAN : Hast thou not dropp 'd from heaven ?
STEPHANO : Out o ' the moon , I do assure thee : I was the man i ' the moon when time was .
CALIBAN : I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee : My mistress show 'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush .
STEPHANO : Come , swear to that ; kiss the book : I will furnish it anon with new contents swear .
