ARIEL : Well , I conceive . Exit
PROSPERO : Look thou be true ; do not give dalliance Too much the rein : the strongest oaths are straw To the fire i ' the blood : be more abstemious , Or else , good night your vow !
FERDINAND : I warrant you sir ; The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardour of my liver .
PROSPERO : Well . Now come , my Ariel ! bring a corollary , Rather than want a spirit : appear and pertly ! No tongue ! all eyes ! be silent . Soft music Enter IRIS
IRIS : Ceres , most bounteous lady , thy rich leas Of wheat , rye , barley , vetches , oats and pease ; Thy turfy mountains , where live nibbling sheep , And flat meads thatch 'd with stover , them to keep ; Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims , Which spongy April at thy hest betrims , To make cold nymphs chaste crowns ; and thy broom -groves , Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves , Being lass-lorn : thy pole-clipt vineyard ; And thy sea-marge , sterile and rocky-hard , Where thou thyself dost air ; --the queen o ' the sky , Whose watery arch and messenger am I , Bids thee leave these , and with her sovereign grace , Here on this grass-plot , in this very place , To come and sport : her peacocks fly amain : Approach , rich Ceres , her to entertain . Enter CERES
CERES : Hail , many-colour 'd messenger , that ne 'er Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter ; Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers Diffusest honey-drops , refreshing showers , And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown My bosky acres and my unshrubb 'd down , Rich scarf to my proud earth ; why hath thy queen Summon 'd me hither , to this short-grass 'd green ?
IRIS : A contract of true love to celebrate ; And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers .
CERES : Tell me , heavenly bow , If Venus or her son , as thou dost know , Do now attend the queen ? Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got , Her and her blind boy 's scandal 'd company I have forsworn .
IRIS : Of her society Be not afraid : I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son Dove-drawn with her . Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid , Whose vows are , that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen 's torch be lighted : but vain ; Mars 's hot minion is returned again ; Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows , Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows And be a boy right out .
CERES : High 'st queen of state , Great Juno , comes ; I know her by her gait . Enter JUNO
JUNO : How does my bounteous sister ? Go with me To bless this twain , that they may prosperous be And honour 'd in their issue . They sing :
JUNO : Honour , riches , marriage-blessing , Long continuance , and increasing , Hourly joys be still upon you ! Juno sings her blessings upon you .
CERES : Earth 's increase , foison plenty , Barns and garners never empty , Vines and clustering bunches growing , Plants with goodly burthen bowing ; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest ! Scarcity and want shall shun you ; Ceres ' blessing so is on you .
FERDINAND : This is a most majestic vision , and Harmoniously charmingly . May I be bold To think these spirits ?
PROSPERO : Spirits , which by mine art I have from their confines call 'd to enact My present fancies .
FERDINAND : Let me live here ever ; So rare a wonder 'd father and a wife Makes this place Paradise . Juno and Ceres whisper , and send Iris on employment
PROSPERO : Sweet , now , silence ! Juno and Ceres whisper seriously ; There 's something else to do : hush , and be mute , Or else our spell is marr 'd .
