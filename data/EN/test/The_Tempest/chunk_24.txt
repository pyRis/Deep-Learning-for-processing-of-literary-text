PROSPERO : Ye elves of hills , brooks , standing lakes and groves , And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back ; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make , Whereof the ewe not bites , and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms , that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew ; by whose aid , Weak masters though ye be , I have bedimm 'd The noontide sun , call 'd forth the mutinous winds , And ' twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war : to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire and rifted Jove 's stout oak With his own bolt ; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck 'd up The pine and cedar : graves at my command Have waked their sleepers , oped , and let ' em forth By my so potent art . But this rough magic I here abjure , and , when I have required Some heavenly music , which even now I do , To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for , I 'll break my staff , Bury it certain fathoms in the earth , And deeper than did ever plummet sound I 'll drown my book . Solemn music Re-enter ARIEL before : then ALONSO , with a frantic gesture , attended by GONZALO ; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner , attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made , and there stand charmed ; which PROSPERO observing , speaks : A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains , Now useless , boil 'd within thy skull ! There stand , For you are spell-stopp 'd . Holy Gonzalo , honourable man , Mine eyes , even sociable to the show of thine , Fall fellowly drops . The charm dissolves apace , And as the morning steals upon the night , Melting the darkness , so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason . O good Gonzalo , My true preserver , and a loyal sir To him you follow 'st ! I will pay thy graces Home both in word and deed . Most cruelly Didst thou , Alonso , use me and my daughter : Thy brother was a furtherer in the act . Thou art pinch 'd fort now , Sebastian . Flesh and blood , You , brother mine , that entertain 'd ambition , Expell 'd remorse and nature ; who , with Sebastian , Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong , Would here have kill 'd your king ; I do forgive thee , Unnatural though thou art . Their understanding Begins to swell , and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shore That now lies foul and muddy . Not one of them That yet looks on me , or would know me Ariel , Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell : I will discase me , and myself present As I was sometime Milan : quickly , spirit ; Thou shalt ere long be free . ARIEL sings and helps to attire him Where the bee sucks. there suck I : In a cowslip 's bell I lie ; There I couch when owls do cry . On the bat 's back I do fly After summer merrily . Merrily , merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough .
PROSPERO : Why , that 's my dainty Ariel ! I shall miss thee : But yet thou shalt have freedom : so , so , so . To the king 's ship , invisible as thou art : There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches ; the master and the boatswain Being awake , enforce them to this place , And presently , I prithee .
ARIEL : I drink the air before me , and return Or ere your pulse twice beat . Exit
GONZALO : All torment , trouble , wonder and amazement Inhabits here : some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country !
PROSPERO : Behold , sir king , The wronged Duke of Milan , Prospero : For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee , I embrace thy body ; And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome .
ALONSO : Whether thou best he or no , Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me , As late I have been , I not know : thy pulse Beats as of flesh and blood ; and , since I saw thee , The affliction of my mind amends , with which , I fear , a madness held me : this must crave , An if this be at all , a most strange story . Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs . But how should Prospero Be living and be here ?
PROSPERO : First , noble friend , Let me embrace thine age , whose honour cannot Be measured or confined .
GONZALO : Whether this be Or be not , I 'll not swear .
PROSPERO : You do yet taste Some subtilties o ' the isle , that will not let you Believe things certain . Welcome , my friends all ! Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO But you , my brace of lords , were I so minded , I here could pluck his highness ' frown upon you And justify you traitors : at this time I will tell no tales .
SEBASTIAN : The devil speaks in him .
PROSPERO : No . For you , most wicked sir , whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth , I do forgive Thy rankest fault ; all of them ; and require My dukedom of thee , which perforce , I know , Thou must restore .
ALONSO : If thou be 'st Prospero , Give us particulars of thy preservation ; How thou hast met us here , who three hours since Were wreck 'd upon this shore ; where I have lost-- How sharp the point of this remembrance is ! -- My dear son Ferdinand .
PROSPERO : I am woe for 't , sir .
ALONSO : Irreparable is the loss , and patience Says it is past her cure .
PROSPERO : I rather think You have not sought her help , of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content .
ALONSO : You the like loss !
PROSPERO : As great to me as late ; and , supportable To make the dear loss , have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter .
ALONSO : A daughter ? O heavens , that they were living both in Naples , The king and queen there ! that they were , I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies . When did you lose your daughter ?
