PROSPERO : Why , that 's my dainty Ariel ! I shall miss thee : But yet thou shalt have freedom : so , so , so . To the king 's ship , invisible as thou art : There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches ; the master and the boatswain Being awake , enforce them to this place , And presently , I prithee .
ARIEL : I drink the air before me , and return Or ere your pulse twice beat . Exit
GONZALO : All torment , trouble , wonder and amazement Inhabits here : some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country !
PROSPERO : Behold , sir king , The wronged Duke of Milan , Prospero : For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee , I embrace thy body ; And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome .
ALONSO : Whether thou best he or no , Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me , As late I have been , I not know : thy pulse Beats as of flesh and blood ; and , since I saw thee , The affliction of my mind amends , with which , I fear , a madness held me : this must crave , An if this be at all , a most strange story . Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs . But how should Prospero Be living and be here ?
PROSPERO : First , noble friend , Let me embrace thine age , whose honour cannot Be measured or confined .
GONZALO : Whether this be Or be not , I 'll not swear .
PROSPERO : You do yet taste Some subtilties o ' the isle , that will not let you Believe things certain . Welcome , my friends all ! Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO But you , my brace of lords , were I so minded , I here could pluck his highness ' frown upon you And justify you traitors : at this time I will tell no tales .
SEBASTIAN : The devil speaks in him .
PROSPERO : No . For you , most wicked sir , whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth , I do forgive Thy rankest fault ; all of them ; and require My dukedom of thee , which perforce , I know , Thou must restore .
ALONSO : If thou be 'st Prospero , Give us particulars of thy preservation ; How thou hast met us here , who three hours since Were wreck 'd upon this shore ; where I have lost-- How sharp the point of this remembrance is ! -- My dear son Ferdinand .
PROSPERO : I am woe for 't , sir .
ALONSO : Irreparable is the loss , and patience Says it is past her cure .
PROSPERO : I rather think You have not sought her help , of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content .
ALONSO : You the like loss !
PROSPERO : As great to me as late ; and , supportable To make the dear loss , have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter .
ALONSO : A daughter ? O heavens , that they were living both in Naples , The king and queen there ! that they were , I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies . When did you lose your daughter ?
