STEPHANO : Drink , servant-monster , when I bid thee : thy eyes are almost set in thy head .
TRINCULO : Where should they be set else ? he were a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail .
STEPHANO : My man-monster hath drown 'd his tongue in sack : for my part , the sea cannot drown me ; I swam , ere I could recover the shore , five and thirty leagues off and on . By this light , thou shalt be my lieutenant , monster , or my standard .
TRINCULO : Your lieutenant , if you list ; he 's no standard .
STEPHANO : We 'll not run , Monsieur Monster .
TRINCULO : Nor go neither ; but you 'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither .
STEPHANO : Moon-calf , speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good moon-calf .
CALIBAN : How does thy honour ? Let me lick thy shoe . I 'll not serve him ; he 's not valiant .
TRINCULO : Thou liest , most ignorant monster : I am in case to justle a constable . Why , thou deboshed fish thou , was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day ? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie , being but half a fish and half a monster ?
CALIBAN : Lo , how he mocks me ! wilt thou let him , my lord ?
TRINCULO : ' Lord ' quoth he ! That a monster should be such a natural !
CALIBAN : Lo , lo , again ! bite him to death , I prithee .
STEPHANO : Trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head : if you prove a mutineer , --the next tree ! The poor monster 's my subject and he shall not suffer indignity .
CALIBAN : I thank my noble lord . Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee ?
STEPHANO : Marry , will I kneel and repeat it ; I will stand , and so shall Trinculo . Enter ARIEL , invisible
CALIBAN : As I told thee before , I am subject to a tyrant , a sorcerer , that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island .
ARIEL : Thou liest .
CALIBAN : Thou liest , thou jesting monkey , thou : I would my valiant master would destroy thee ! I do not lie .
STEPHANO : Trinculo , if you trouble him any more in 's tale , by this hand , I will supplant some of your teeth .
TRINCULO : Why , I said nothing .
STEPHANO : Mum , then , and no more . Proceed .
CALIBAN : I say , by sorcery he got this isle ; From me he got it. if thy greatness will Revenge it on him , --for I know thou darest , But this thing dare not , --
STEPHANO : That 's most certain .
CALIBAN : Thou shalt be lord of it and I 'll serve thee .
STEPHANO : How now shall this be compassed ? Canst thou bring me to the party ?
CALIBAN : Yea , yea , my lord : I 'll yield him thee asleep , Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead .
ARIEL : Thou liest ; thou canst not .
CALIBAN : What a pied ninny 's this ! Thou scurvy patch ! I do beseech thy greatness , give him blows And take his bottle from him : when that 's gone He shall drink nought but brine ; for I 'll not show him Where the quick freshes are .
STEPHANO : Trinculo , run into no further danger : interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , I 'll turn my mercy out o ' doors and make a stock-fish of thee .
TRINCULO : Why , what did I ? I did nothing . I 'll go farther off .
STEPHANO : Didst thou not say he lied ?
ARIEL : Thou liest .
STEPHANO : Do I so ? take thou that . Beats TRINCULO As you like this , give me the lie another time .
TRINCULO : I did not give the lie . Out o ' your wits and bearing too ? A pox o ' your bottle ! this can sack and drinking do . A murrain on your monster , and the devil take your fingers !
