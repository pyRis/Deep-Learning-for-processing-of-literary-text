OBERON : Now , until the break of day , Through this house each fairy stray . To the best bride-bed will we , Which by us shall blessed be ; And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate . So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be ; And the blots of Nature 's hand Shall not in their issue stand ; Never mole , hare lip , nor scar , Nor mark prodigious , such as are Despised in nativity , Shall upon their children be . With this field-dew consecrate , Every fairy take his gait ; And each several chamber bless , Through this palace , with sweet peace ; And the owner of it blest Ever shall in safety rest . Trip away ; make no stay ; Meet me all by break of day .
