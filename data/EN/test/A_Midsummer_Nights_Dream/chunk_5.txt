Fairy : And here my mistress . Would that he were gone ! Enter , from one side , OBERON , with his train ; from the other , TITANIA , with hers
OBERON : Ill met by moonlight , proud Titania .
TITANIA : What , jealous Oberon ! Fairies , skip hence : I have forsworn his bed and company .
OBERON : Tarry , rash wanton : am not I thy lord ?
TITANIA : Then I must be thy lady : but I know When thou hast stolen away from fairy land , And in the shape of Corin sat all day , Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida . Why art thou here , Come from the farthest Steppe of India ? But that , forsooth , the bouncing Amazon , Your buskin 'd mistress and your warrior love , To Theseus must be wedded , and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity .
OBERON : How canst thou thus for shame , Titania , Glance at my credit with Hippolyta , Knowing I know thy love to Theseus ? Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia , whom he ravished ? And make him with fair AEgle break his faith , With Ariadne and Antiopa ?
TITANIA : These are the forgeries of jealousy : And never , since the middle summer 's spring , Met we on hill , in dale , forest or mead , By paved fountain or by rushy brook , Or in the beached margent of the sea , To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , But with thy brawls thou hast disturb 'd our sport . Therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , As in revenge , have suck 'd up from the sea Contagious fogs ; which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents : The ox hath therefore stretch 'd his yoke in vain , The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain 'd a beard ; The fold stands empty in the drowned field , And crows are fatted with the murrion flock ; The nine men 's morris is fill 'd up with mud , And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable : The human mortals want their winter here ; No night is now with hymn or carol blest : Therefore the moon , the governess of floods , Pale in her anger , washes all the air , That rheumatic diseases do abound : And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose , And on old Hiems ' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is , as in mockery , set : the spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter , change Their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , By their increase , now knows not which is which : And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate , from our dissension ; We are their parents and original .
OBERON : Do you amend it then ; it lies in you : Why should Titania cross her Oberon ? I do but beg a little changeling boy , To be my henchman .
TITANIA : Set your heart at rest : The fairy land buys not the child of me . His mother was a votaress of my order : And , in the spiced Indian air , by night , Full often hath she gossip 'd by my side , And sat with me on Neptune 's yellow sands , Marking the embarked traders on the flood , When we have laugh 'd to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind ; Which she , with pretty and with swimming gait Following , --her womb then rich with my young squire , -- Would imitate , and sail upon the land , To fetch me trifles , and return again , As from a voyage , rich with merchandise . But she , being mortal , of that boy did die ; And for her sake do I rear up her boy , And for her sake I will not part with him .
OBERON : How long within this wood intend you stay ?
