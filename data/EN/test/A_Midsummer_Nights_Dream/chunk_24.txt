Lion : You , ladies , you , whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor , May now perchance both quake and tremble here , When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar . Then know that I , one Snug the joiner , am A lion-fell , nor else no lion 's dam ; For , if I should as lion come in strife Into this place , ' twere pity on my life .
THESEUS : A very gentle beast , of a good conscience .
DEMETRIUS : The very best at a beast , my lord , that e 'er I saw .
LYSANDER : This lion is a very fox for his valour .
THESEUS : True ; and a goose for his discretion .
DEMETRIUS : Not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion ; and the fox carries the goose .
THESEUS : His discretion , I am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . It is well : leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
Moonshine : This lanthorn doth the horned moon present ; --
DEMETRIUS : He should have worn the horns on his head .
THESEUS : He is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference .
Moonshine : This lanthorn doth the horned moon present ; Myself the man i ' the moon do seem to be .
THESEUS : This is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lanthorn . How is it else the man i ' the moon ?
DEMETRIUS : He dares not come there for the candle ; for , you see , it is already in snuff .
HIPPOLYTA : I am aweary of this moon : would he would change !
THESEUS : It appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane ; but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must stay the time .
LYSANDER : Proceed , Moon .
Moonshine : All that I have to say , is , to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon ; I , the man in the moon ; this thorn-bush , my thorn-bush ; and this dog , my dog .
DEMETRIUS : Why , all these should be in the lanthorn ; for all these are in the moon . But , silence ! here comes Thisbe . Enter Thisbe
Thisbe : This is old Ninny 's tomb . Where is my love ?
Lion : Oh-- Thisbe runs off
DEMETRIUS : Well roared , Lion .
THESEUS : Well run , Thisbe .
HIPPOLYTA : Well shone , Moon . Truly , the moon shines with a good grace . The Lion shakes Thisbe 's mantle , and exit
THESEUS : Well moused , Lion .
LYSANDER : And so the lion vanished .
DEMETRIUS : And then came Pyramus . Enter Pyramus
Pyramus : Sweet Moon , I thank thee for thy sunny beams ; I thank thee , Moon , for shining now so bright ; For , by thy gracious , golden , glittering gleams , I trust to take of truest Thisby sight . But stay , O spite ! But mark , poor knight , What dreadful dole is here ! Eyes , do you see ? How can it be ? O dainty duck ! O dear ! Thy mantle good , What , stain 'd with blood ! Approach , ye Furies fell ! O Fates , come , come , Cut thread and thrum ; Quail , crush , conclude , and quell !
THESEUS : This passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad .
HIPPOLYTA : Beshrew my heart , but I pity the man .
Pyramus : O wherefore , Nature , didst thou lions frame ? Since lion vile hath here deflower 'd my dear : Which is--no , no--which was the fairest dame That lived , that loved , that liked , that look 'd with cheer . Come , tears , confound ; Out , sword , and wound The pap of Pyramus ; Ay , that left pap , Where heart doth hop : Stabs himself Thus die I , thus , thus , thus . Now am I dead , Now am I fled ; My soul is in the sky : Tongue , lose thy light ; Moon take thy flight : Exit Moonshine Now die , die , die , die , die . Dies
DEMETRIUS : No die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one .
LYSANDER : Less than an ace , man ; for he is dead ; he is nothing .
