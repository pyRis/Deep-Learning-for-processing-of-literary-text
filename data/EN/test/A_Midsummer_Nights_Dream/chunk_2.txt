HERMIA : My good Lysander ! I swear to thee , by Cupid 's strongest bow , By his best arrow with the golden head , By the simplicity of Venus ' doves , By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves , And by that fire which burn 'd the Carthage queen , When the false Troyan under sail was seen , By all the vows that ever men have broke , In number more than ever women spoke , In that same place thou hast appointed me , To-morrow truly will I meet with thee .
LYSANDER : Keep promise , love . Look , here comes Helena . Enter HELENA
HERMIA : God speed fair Helena ! whither away ?
HELENA : Call you me fair ? that fair again unsay . Demetrius loves your fair : O happy fair ! Your eyes are lode-stars ; and your tongue 's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd 's ear , When wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear . Sickness is catching : O , were favour so , Yours would I catch , fair Hermia , ere I go ; My ear should catch your voice , my eye your eye , My tongue should catch your tongue 's sweet melody . Were the world mine , Demetrius being bated , The rest I 'd give to be to you translated . O , teach me how you look , and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius ' heart .
HERMIA : I frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
HELENA : O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !
HERMIA : I give him curses , yet he gives me love .
HELENA : O that my prayers could such affection move !
HERMIA : The more I hate , the more he follows me .
HELENA : The more I love , the more he hateth me .
HERMIA : His folly , Helena , is no fault of mine .
HELENA : None , but your beauty : would that fault were mine !
HERMIA : Take comfort : he no more shall see my face ; Lysander and myself will fly this place . Before the time I did Lysander see , Seem 'd Athens as a paradise to me : O , then , what graces in my love do dwell , That he hath turn 'd a heaven unto a hell !
LYSANDER : Helen , to you our minds we will unfold : To-morrow night , when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass , Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass , A time that lovers ' flights doth still conceal , Through Athens ' gates have we devised to steal .
HERMIA : And in the wood , where often you and I Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie , Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet , There my Lysander and myself shall meet ; And thence from Athens turn away our eyes , To seek new friends and stranger companies . Farewell , sweet playfellow : pray thou for us ; And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius ! Keep word , Lysander : we must starve our sight From lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
LYSANDER : I will , my Hermia . Exit HERMIA Helena , adieu : As you on him , Demetrius dote on you ! Exit
