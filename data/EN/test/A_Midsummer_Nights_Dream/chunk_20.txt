THESEUS : Fair lovers , you are fortunately met : Of this discourse we more will hear anon . Egeus , I will overbear your will ; For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit : And , for the morning now is something worn , Our purposed hunting shall be set aside . Away with us to Athens ; three and three , We 'll hold a feast in great solemnity . Come , Hippolyta .
DEMETRIUS : These things seem small and undistinguishable ,
HERMIA : Methinks I see these things with parted eye , When every thing seems double .
HELENA : So methinks : And I have found Demetrius like a jewel , Mine own , and not mine own .
DEMETRIUS : Are you sure That we are awake ? It seems to me That yet we sleep , we dream . Do not you think The duke was here , and bid us follow him ?
HERMIA : Yea ; and my father .
HELENA : And Hippolyta .
LYSANDER : And he did bid us follow to the temple .
DEMETRIUS : Why , then , we are awake : let 's follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams .
BOTTOM : When my cue comes , call me , and I will answer : my next is , ' Most fair Pyramus . ' Heigh-ho ! Peter Quince ! Flute , the bellows-mender ! Snout , the tinker ! Starveling ! God 's my life , stolen hence , and left me asleep ! I have had a most rare vision . I have had a dream , past the wit of man to say what dream it was : man is but an ass , if he go about to expound this dream . Methought I was--there is no man can tell what . Methought I was , --and methought I had , --but man is but a patched fool , if he will offer to say what methought I had . The eye of man hath not heard , the ear of man hath not seen , man 's hand is not able to taste , his tongue to conceive , nor his heart to report , what my dream was . I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream : it shall be called Bottom 's Dream , because it hath no bottom ; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play , before the duke : peradventure , to make it the more gracious , I shall sing it at her death . Exit Enter QUINCE , FLUTE , SNOUT , and STARVELING
QUINCE : Have you sent to Bottom 's house ? is he come home yet ?
STARVELING : He cannot be heard of . Out of doubt he is transported .
FLUTE : If he come not , then the play is marred : it goes not forward , doth it ?
QUINCE : It is not possible : you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he .
FLUTE : No , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens .
QUINCE : Yea and the best person too ; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice .
FLUTE : You must say ' paragon : ' a paramour is , God bless us , a thing of naught . Enter SNUG
SNUG : Masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
FLUTE : O sweet bully Bottom ! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a day : an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus , I 'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a day in Pyramus , or nothing . Enter BOTTOM
BOTTOM : Where are these lads ? where are these hearts ?
QUINCE : Bottom ! O most courageous day ! O most happy hour !
BOTTOM : Masters , I am to discourse wonders : but ask me not what ; for if I tell you , I am no true Athenian . I will tell you every thing , right as it fell out .
