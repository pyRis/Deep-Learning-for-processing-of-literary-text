HELENA : Your virtue is my privilege : for that It is not night when I do see your face , Therefore I think I am not in the night ; Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , For you in my respect are all the world : Then how can it be said I am alone , When all the world is here to look on me ?
DEMETRIUS : I 'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
HELENA : The wildest hath not such a heart as you . Run when you will , the story shall be changed : Apollo flies , and Daphne holds the chase ; The dove pursues the griffin ; the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger ; bootless speed , When cowardice pursues and valour flies .
DEMETRIUS : I will not stay thy questions ; let me go : Or , if thou follow me , do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood .
HELENA : Ay , in the temple , in the town , the field , You do me mischief . Fie , Demetrius ! Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex : We cannot fight for love , as men may do ; We should be wood and were not made to woo . Exit DEMETRIUS I 'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , To die upon the hand I love so well . Exit
OBERON : Fare thee well , nymph : ere he do leave this grove , Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love . Re-enter PUCK Hast thou the flower there ? Welcome , wanderer .
PUCK : Ay , there it is .
OBERON : I pray thee , give it me . I know a bank where the wild thyme blows , Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows , Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine , With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine : There sleeps Titania sometime of the night , Lull 'd in these flowers with dances and delight ; And there the snake throws her enamell 'd skin , Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in : And with the juice of this I 'll streak her eyes , And make her full of hateful fantasies . Take thou some of it , and seek through this grove : A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth : anoint his eyes ; But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady : thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on . Effect it with some care , that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love : And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow .
PUCK : Fear not , my lord , your servant shall do so . Enter TITANIA , with her train
TITANIA : Come , now a roundel and a fairy song ; Then , for the third part of a minute , hence ; Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds , Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings , To make my small elves coats , and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits . Sing me now asleep ; Then to your offices and let me rest . The Fairies sing You spotted snakes with double tongue , Thorny hedgehogs , be not seen ; Newts and blind-worms , do no wrong , Come not near our fairy queen . Philomel , with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby ; Lulla , lulla , lullaby , lulla , lulla , lullaby : Never harm , Nor spell nor charm , Come our lovely lady nigh ; So , good night , with lullaby . Weaving spiders , come not here ; Hence , you long-legg 'd spinners , hence ! Beetles black , approach not near ; Worm nor snail , do no offence . Philomel , with melody , & c .
Fairy : Hence , away ! now all is well : One aloof stand sentinel . Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA 's eyelids
