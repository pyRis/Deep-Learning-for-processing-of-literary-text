THESEUS : With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover , and prove an ass .
HIPPOLYTA : How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover ?
THESEUS : She will find him by starlight . Here she comes ; and her passion ends the play . Re-enter Thisbe
HIPPOLYTA : Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus : I hope she will be brief .
DEMETRIUS : A mote will turn the balance , which Pyramus , which Thisbe , is the better ; he for a man , God warrant us ; she for a woman , God bless us .
LYSANDER : She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
DEMETRIUS : And thus she means , videlicet : --
Thisbe : Asleep , my love ? What , dead , my dove ? O Pyramus , arise ! Speak , speak . Quite dumb ? Dead , dead ? A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes . These My lips , This cherry nose , These yellow cowslip cheeks , Are gone , are gone : Lovers , make moan : His eyes were green as leeks . O Sisters Three , Come , come to me , With hands as pale as milk ; Lay them in gore , Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk . Tongue , not a word : Come , trusty sword ; Come , blade , my breast imbrue : Stabs herself And , farewell , friends ; Thus Thisby ends : Adieu , adieu , adieu . Dies
THESEUS : Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
DEMETRIUS : Ay , and Wall too .
BOTTOM : No assure you ; the wall is down that parted their fathers . Will it please you to see the epilogue , or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company ?
THESEUS : No epilogue , I pray you ; for your play needs no excuse . Never excuse ; for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed . Marry , if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe 's garter , it would have been a fine tragedy : and so it is , truly ; and very notably discharged . But come , your Bergomask : let your epilogue alone . A dance The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : Lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatch 'd . This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled The heavy gait of night . Sweet friends , to bed . A fortnight hold we this solemnity , In nightly revels and new jollity . Enter PUCK
PUCK : Now the hungry lion roars , And the wolf behowls the moon ; Whilst the heavy ploughman snores , All with weary task fordone . Now the wasted brands do glow , Whilst the screech-owl , screeching loud , Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud . Now it is the time of night That the graves all gaping wide , Every one lets forth his sprite , In the church-way paths to glide : And we fairies , that do run By the triple Hecate 's team , From the presence of the sun , Following darkness like a dream , Now are frolic : not a mouse Shall disturb this hallow 'd house : I am sent with broom before , To sweep the dust behind the door . Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train
OBERON : Through the house give gathering light , By the dead and drowsy fire : Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier ; And this ditty , after me , Sing , and dance it trippingly .
TITANIA : First , rehearse your song by rote To each word a warbling note : Hand in hand , with fairy grace , Will we sing , and bless this place . Song and dance
