HELENA : Good Hermia , do not be so bitter with me . I evermore did love you , Hermia , Did ever keep your counsels , never wrong 'd you ; Save that , in love unto Demetrius , I told him of your stealth unto this wood . He follow 'd you ; for love I follow 'd him ; But he hath chid me hence and threaten 'd me To strike me , spurn me , nay , to kill me too : And now , so you will let me quiet go , To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further : let me go : You see how simple and how fond I am .
HERMIA : Why , get you gone : who is 't that hinders you ?
HELENA : A foolish heart , that I leave here behind .
HERMIA : What , with Lysander ?
HELENA : With Demetrius .
LYSANDER : Be not afraid ; she shall not harm thee , Helena .
DEMETRIUS : No , sir , she shall not , though you take her part .
HELENA : O , when she 's angry , she is keen and shrewd ! She was a vixen when she went to school ; And though she be but little , she is fierce .
HERMIA : ' Little ' again ! nothing but ' low ' and ' little ' ! Why will you suffer her to flout me thus ? Let me come to her .
LYSANDER : Get you gone , you dwarf ; You minimus , of hindering knot-grass made ; You bead , you acorn .
DEMETRIUS : You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services . Let her alone : speak not of Helena ; Take not her part ; for , if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her , Thou shalt aby it .
LYSANDER : Now she holds me not ; Now follow , if thou darest , to try whose right , Of thine or mine , is most in Helena .
DEMETRIUS : Follow ! nay , I 'll go with thee , cheek by jole .
HERMIA : You , mistress , all this coil is ' long of you : Nay , go not back .
HELENA : I will not trust you , I , Nor longer stay in your curst company . Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray , My legs are longer though , to run away . Exit
HERMIA : I am amazed , and know not what to say . Exit
OBERON : This is thy negligence : still thou mistakest , Or else committ 'st thy knaveries wilfully .
PUCK : Believe me , king of shadows , I mistook . Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment be had on ? And so far blameless proves my enterprise , That I have ' nointed an Athenian 's eyes ; And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sport .
OBERON : Thou see 'st these lovers seek a place to fight : Hie therefore , Robin , overcast the night ; The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron , And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another 's way . Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue , Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong ; And sometime rail thou like Demetrius ; And from each other look thou lead them thus , Till o 'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep : Then crush this herb into Lysander 's eye ; Whose liquor hath this virtuous property , To take from thence all error with his might , And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight . When they next wake , all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision , And back to Athens shall the lovers wend , With league whose date till death shall never end . Whiles I in this affair do thee employ , I 'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy ; And then I will her charmed eye release From monster 's view , and all things shall be peace .
PUCK : My fairy lord , this must be done with haste , For night 's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast , And yonder shines Aurora 's harbinger ; At whose approach , ghosts , wandering here and there , Troop home to churchyards : damned spirits all , That in crossways and floods have burial , Already to their wormy beds are gone ; For fear lest day should look their shames upon , They willfully themselves exile from light And must for aye consort with black-brow 'd night .
