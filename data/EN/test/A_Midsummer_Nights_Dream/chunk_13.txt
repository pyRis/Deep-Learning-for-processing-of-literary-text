HERMIA : I pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
DEMETRIUS : An if I could , what should I get therefore ?
HERMIA : A privilege never to see me more . And from thy hated presence part I so : See me no more , whether he be dead or no . Exit
DEMETRIUS : There is no following her in this fierce vein : Here therefore for a while I will remain . So sorrow 's heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe : Which now in some slight measure it will pay , If for his tender here I make some stay . Lies down and sleeps
OBERON : What hast thou done ? thou hast mistaken quite And laid the love-juice on some true-love 's sight : Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turn 'd and not a false turn 'd true .
PUCK : Then fate o 'er-rules , that , one man holding troth , A million fail , confounding oath on oath .
OBERON : About the wood go swifter than the wind , And Helena of Athens look thou find : All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer , With sighs of love , that costs the fresh blood dear : By some illusion see thou bring her here : I 'll charm his eyes against she do appear .
PUCK : I go , I go ; look how I go , Swifter than arrow from the Tartar 's bow . Exit
OBERON : Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid 's archery , Sink in apple of his eye . When his love he doth espy , Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky . When thou wakest , if she be by , Beg of her for remedy . Re-enter PUCK
PUCK : Captain of our fairy band , Helena is here at hand ; And the youth , mistook by me , Pleading for a lover 's fee . Shall we their fond pageant see ? Lord , what fools these mortals be !
OBERON : Stand aside : the noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake .
PUCK : Then will two at once woo one ; That must needs be sport alone ; And those things do best please me That befal preposterously . Enter LYSANDER and HELENA
LYSANDER : Why should you think that I should woo in scorn ? Scorn and derision never come in tears : Look , when I vow , I weep ; and vows so born , In their nativity all truth appears . How can these things in me seem scorn to you , Bearing the badge of faith , to prove them true ?
HELENA : You do advance your cunning more and more . When truth kills truth , O devilish-holy fray ! These vows are Hermia 's : will you give her o 'er ? Weigh oath with oath , and you will nothing weigh : Your vows to her and me , put in two scales , Will even weigh , and both as light as tales .
LYSANDER : I had no judgment when to her I swore .
HELENA : Nor none , in my mind , now you give her o 'er .
LYSANDER : Demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
DEMETRIUS : O Helena , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine ! To what , my love , shall I compare thine eyne ? Crystal is muddy . O , how ripe in show Thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow ! That pure congealed white , high Taurus snow , Fann 'd with the eastern wind , turns to a crow When thou hold 'st up thy hand : O , let me kiss This princess of pure white , this seal of bliss !
