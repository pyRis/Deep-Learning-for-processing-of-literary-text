BOTTOM : Masters , I am to discourse wonders : but ask me not what ; for if I tell you , I am no true Athenian . I will tell you every thing , right as it fell out .
QUINCE : Let us hear , sweet Bottom .
BOTTOM : Not a word of me . All that I will tell you is , that the duke hath dined . Get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps ; meet presently at the palace ; every man look o 'er his part ; for the short and the long is , our play is preferred . In any case , let Thisby have clean linen ; and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails , for they shall hang out for the lion 's claws . And , most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath ; and I do not doubt but to hear them say , it is a sweet comedy . No more words : away ! go , away ! Enter THESEUS , HIPPOLYTA , PHILOSTRATE , Lords and Attendants
HIPPOLYTA : ' Tis strange my Theseus , that these lovers speak of .
THESEUS : More strange than true : I never may believe These antique fables , nor these fairy toys . Lovers and madmen have such seething brains , Such shaping fantasies , that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends . The lunatic , the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact : One sees more devils than vast hell can hold , That is , the madman : the lover , all as frantic , Sees Helen 's beauty in a brow of Egypt : The poet 's eye , in fine frenzy rolling , Doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown , the poet 's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name . Such tricks hath strong imagination , That if it would but apprehend some joy , It comprehends some bringer of that joy ; Or in the night , imagining some fear , How easy is a bush supposed a bear !
HIPPOLYTA : But all the story of the night told over , And all their minds transfigured so together , More witnesseth than fancy 's images And grows to something of great constancy ; But , howsoever , strange and admirable .
THESEUS : Here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . Enter LYSANDER , DEMETRIUS , HERMIA , and HELENA Joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts !
LYSANDER : More than to us Wait in your royal walks , your board , your bed !
THESEUS : Come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bed-time ? Where is our usual manager of mirth ? What revels are in hand ? Is there no play , To ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? Call Philostrate .
PHILOSTRATE : Here , mighty Theseus .
THESEUS : Say , what abridgement have you for this evening ? What masque ? what music ? How shall we beguile The lazy time , if not with some delight ?
PHILOSTRATE : There is a brief how many sports are ripe : Make choice of which your highness will see first . Giving a paper
THESEUS : ' The battle with the Centaurs , to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp . ' We 'll none of that : that have I told my love , In glory of my kinsman Hercules . Reads ' The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals , Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage . ' That is an old device ; and it was play 'd When I from Thebes came last a conqueror . Reads ' The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of Learning , late deceased in beggary . ' That is some satire , keen and critical , Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . Reads ' A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' Merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! That is , hot ice and wondrous strange snow . How shall we find the concord of this discord ?
