BOTTOM : Mounsieur Cobweb , good mounsieur , get you your weapons in your hand , and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle ; and , good mounsieur , bring me the honey-bag . Do not fret yourself too much in the action , mounsieur ; and , good mounsieur , have a care the honey-bag break not ; I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag , signior . Where 's Mounsieur Mustardseed ?
MUSTARDSEED : Ready .
BOTTOM : Give me your neaf , Mounsieur Mustardseed . Pray you , leave your courtesy , good mounsieur .
MUSTARDSEED : What 's your Will ?
BOTTOM : Nothing , good mounsieur , but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch . I must to the barber 's , monsieur ; for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face ; and I am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , I must scratch .
TITANIA : What , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
BOTTOM : I have a reasonable good ear in music . Let 's have the tongs and the bones .
TITANIA : Or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
BOTTOM : Truly , a peck of provender : I could munch your good dry oats . Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay : good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
TITANIA : I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel 's hoard , and fetch thee new nuts .
BOTTOM : I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas . But , I pray you , let none of your people stir me : I have an exposition of sleep come upon me .
TITANIA : Sleep thou , and I will wind thee in my arms . Fairies , begone , and be all ways away . So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist ; the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm . O , how I love thee ! how I dote on thee ! They sleep Enter PUCK
OBERON : Welcome , good Robin . See 'st thou this sweet sight ? Her dotage now I do begin to pity : For , meeting her of late behind the wood , Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool , I did upbraid her and fall out with her ; For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers ; And that same dew , which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls , Stood now within the pretty flowerets ' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail . When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms begg 'd my patience , I then did ask of her her changeling child ; Which straight she gave me , and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairy land . And now I have the boy , I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes : And , gentle Puck , take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain ; That , he awaking when the other do , May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night 's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream . But first I will release the fairy queen . Be as thou wast wont to be ; See as thou wast wont to see : Dian 's bud o 'er Cupid 's flower Hath such force and blessed power . Now , my Titania ; wake you , my sweet queen .
TITANIA : My Oberon ! what visions have I seen ! Methought I was enamour 'd of an ass .
OBERON : There lies your love .
TITANIA : How came these things to pass ? O , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now !
OBERON : Silence awhile . Robin , take off this head . Titania , music call ; and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense .
TITANIA : Music , ho ! music , such as charmeth sleep ! Music , still
PUCK : Now , when thou wakest , with thine own fool 's eyes peep .
