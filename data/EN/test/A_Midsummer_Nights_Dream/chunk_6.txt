TITANIA : Perchance till after Theseus ' wedding-day . If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels , go with us ; If not , shun me , and I will spare your haunts .
OBERON : Give me that boy , and I will go with thee .
TITANIA : Not for thy fairy kingdom . Fairies , away ! We shall chide downright , if I longer stay . Exit TITANIA with her train
OBERON : Well , go thy way : thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury . My gentle Puck , come hither . Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory , And heard a mermaid on a dolphin 's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres , To hear the sea-maid 's music .
PUCK : I remember .
OBERON : That very time I saw , but thou couldst not , Flying between the cold moon and the earth , Cupid all arm 'd : a certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west , And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow , As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts ; But I might see young Cupid 's fiery shaft Quench 'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon , And the imperial votaress passed on , In maiden meditation , fancy-free . Yet mark 'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell : It fell upon a little western flower , Before milk-white , now purple with love 's wound , And maidens call it love-in-idleness . Fetch me that flower ; the herb I shew 'd thee once : The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees . Fetch me this herb ; and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league .
PUCK : I 'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes . Exit
OBERON : Having once this juice , I 'll watch Titania when she is asleep , And drop the liquor of it in her eyes . The next thing then she waking looks upon , Be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , On meddling monkey , or on busy ape , She shall pursue it with the soul of love : And ere I take this charm from off her sight , As I can take it with another herb , I 'll make her render up her page to me . But who comes here ? I am invisible ; And I will overhear their conference . Enter DEMETRIUS , HELENA , following him
DEMETRIUS : I love thee not , therefore pursue me not . Where is Lysander and fair Hermia ? The one I 'll slay , the other slayeth me . Thou told 'st me they were stolen unto this wood ; And here am I , and wode within this wood , Because I cannot meet my Hermia . Hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
HELENA : You draw me , you hard-hearted adamant ; But yet you draw not iron , for my heart Is true as steel : leave you your power to draw , And I shall have no power to follow you .
DEMETRIUS : Do I entice you ? do I speak you fair ? Or , rather , do I not in plainest truth Tell you , I do not , nor I cannot love you ?
HELENA : And even for that do I love you the more . I am your spaniel ; and , Demetrius , The more you beat me , I will fawn on you : Use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , Neglect me , lose me ; only give me leave , Unworthy as I am , to follow you . What worser place can I beg in your love , -- And yet a place of high respect with me , -- Than to be used as you use your dog ?
DEMETRIUS : Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit ; For I am sick when I do look on thee .
HELENA : And I am sick when I look not on you .
