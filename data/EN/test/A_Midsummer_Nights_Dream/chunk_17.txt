OBERON : But we are spirits of another sort : I with the morning 's love have oft made sport , And , like a forester , the groves may tread , Even till the eastern gate , all fiery-red , Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams , Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams . But , notwithstanding , haste ; make no delay : We may effect this business yet ere day . Exit
PUCK : Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down : I am fear 'd in field and town : Goblin , lead them up and down . Here comes one . Re-enter LYSANDER
LYSANDER : Where art thou , proud Demetrius ? speak thou now .
PUCK : Here , villain ; drawn and ready . Where art thou ?
LYSANDER : I will be with thee straight .
PUCK : Follow me , then , To plainer ground . Exit LYSANDER , as following the voice Re-enter DEMETRIUS
DEMETRIUS : Lysander ! speak again : Thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ? Speak ! In some bush ? Where dost thou hide thy head ?
PUCK : Thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , Telling the bushes that thou look 'st for wars , And wilt not come ? Come , recreant ; come , thou child ; I 'll whip thee with a rod : he is defiled That draws a sword on thee .
DEMETRIUS : Yea , art thou there ?
PUCK : Follow my voice : we 'll try no manhood here . Re-enter LYSANDER
LYSANDER : He goes before me and still dares me on : When I come where he calls , then he is gone . The villain is much lighter-heel 'd than I : I follow 'd fast , but faster he did fly ; That fallen am I in dark uneven way , And here will rest me . Lies down Come , thou gentle day ! For if but once thou show me thy grey light , I 'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite . Sleeps Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS
PUCK : Ho , ho , ho ! Coward , why comest thou not ?
DEMETRIUS : Abide me , if thou darest ; for well I wot Thou runn 'st before me , shifting every place , And darest not stand , nor look me in the face . Where art thou now ?
PUCK : Come hither : I am here .
DEMETRIUS : Nay , then , thou mock 'st me . Thou shalt buy this dear , If ever I thy face by daylight see : Now , go thy way . Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed . By day 's approach look to be visited . Lies down and sleeps Re-enter HELENA
HELENA : O weary night , O long and tedious night , Abate thy hour ! Shine comforts from the east , That I may back to Athens by daylight , From these that my poor company detest : And sleep , that sometimes shuts up sorrow 's eye , Steal me awhile from mine own company . Lies down and sleeps
PUCK : Yet but three ? Come one more ; Two of both kinds make up four . Here she comes , curst and sad : Cupid is a knavish lad , Thus to make poor females mad . Re-enter HERMIA
HERMIA : Never so weary , never so in woe , Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers , I can no further crawl , no further go ; My legs can keep no pace with my desires . Here will I rest me till the break of day . Heavens shield Lysander , if they mean a fray ! Lies down and sleeps
PUCK : On the ground Sleep sound : I 'll apply To your eye , Gentle lover , remedy . Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER 's eyes When thou wakest , Thou takest True delight In the sight Of thy former lady 's eye : And the country proverb known , That every man should take his own , In your waking shall be shown : Jack shall have Jill ; Nought shall go ill ; The man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well . Exit lying asleep . Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM ; PEASEBLOSSOM , COBWEB , MOTH , MUSTARDSEED , and other Fairies attending ; OBERON behind unseen
TITANIA : Come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , While I thy amiable cheeks do coy , And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , And kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy .
BOTTOM : Where 's Peaseblossom ?
PEASEBLOSSOM : Ready .
BOTTOM : Scratch my head Peaseblossom . Where 's Mounsieur Cobweb ?
