HELENA : O spite ! O hell ! I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment : If you we re civil and knew courtesy , You would not do me thus much injury . Can you not hate me , as I know you do , But you must join in souls to mock me too ? If you were men , as men you are in show , You would not use a gentle lady so ; To vow , and swear , and superpraise my parts , When I am sure you hate me with your hearts . You both are rivals , and love Hermia ; And now both rivals , to mock Helena : A trim exploit , a manly enterprise , To conjure tears up in a poor maid 's eyes With your derision ! none of noble sort Would so offend a virgin , and extort A poor soul 's patience , all to make you sport .
LYSANDER : You are unkind , Demetrius ; be not so ; For you love Hermia ; this you know I know : And here , with all good will , with all my heart , In Hermia 's love I yield you up my part ; And yours of Helena to me bequeath , Whom I do love and will do till my death .
HELENA : Never did mockers waste more idle breath .
DEMETRIUS : Lysander , keep thy Hermia ; I will none : If e 'er I loved her , all that love is gone . My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn 'd , And now to Helen is it home return 'd , There to remain .
LYSANDER : Helen , it is not so .
DEMETRIUS : Disparage not the faith thou dost not know , Lest , to thy peril , thou aby it dear . Look , where thy love comes ; yonder is thy dear . Re-enter HERMIA
HERMIA : Dark night , that from the eye his function takes , The ear more quick of apprehension makes ; Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense , It pays the hearing double recompense . Thou art not by mine eye , Lysander , found ; Mine ear , I thank it , brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
LYSANDER : Why should he stay , whom love doth press to go ?
HERMIA : What love could press Lysander from my side ?
LYSANDER : Lysander 's love , that would not let him bide , Fair Helena , who more engilds the night Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light . Why seek 'st thou me ? could not this make thee know , The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so ?
HERMIA : You speak not as you think : it cannot be .
HELENA : Lo , she is one of this confederacy ! Now I perceive they have conjoin 'd all three To fashion this false sport , in spite of me . Injurious Hermia ! most ungrateful maid ! Have you conspired , have you with these contrived To bait me with this foul derision ? Is all the counsel that we two have shared , The sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent , When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us , --O , is it all forgot ? All school-days ' friendship , childhood innocence ? We , Hermia , like two artificial gods , Have with our needles created both one flower , Both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , Both warbling of one song , both in one key , As if our hands , our sides , voices and minds , Had been incorporate . So we grow together , Like to a double cherry , seeming parted , But yet an union in partition ; Two lovely berries moulded on one stem ; So , with two seeming bodies , but one heart ; Two of the first , like coats in heraldry , Due but to one and crowned with one crest . And will you rent our ancient love asunder , To join with men in scorning your poor friend ? It is not friendly , ' tis not maidenly : Our sex , as well as I , may chide you for it , Though I alone do feel the injury .
HERMIA : I am amazed at your passionate words . I scorn you not : it seems that you scorn me .
HELENA : Have you not set Lysander , as in scorn , To follow me and praise my eyes and face ? And made your other love , Demetrius , Who even but now did spurn me with his foot , To call me goddess , nymph , divine and rare , Precious , celestial ? Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates ? and wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love , so rich within his soul , And tender me , forsooth , affection , But by your setting on , by your consent ? What thought I be not so in grace as you , So hung upon with love , so fortunate , But miserable most , to love unloved ? This you should pity rather than despise .
HERNIA : I understand not what you mean by this .
