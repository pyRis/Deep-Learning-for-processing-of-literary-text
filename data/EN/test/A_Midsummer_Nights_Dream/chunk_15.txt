HELENA : Ay , do , persever , counterfeit sad looks , Make mouths upon me when I turn my back ; Wink each at other ; hold the sweet jest up : This sport , well carried , shall be chronicled . If you have any pity , grace , or manners , You would not make me such an argument . But fare ye well : ' tis partly my own fault ; Which death or absence soon shall remedy .
LYSANDER : Stay , gentle Helena ; hear my excuse : My love , my life my soul , fair Helena !
HELENA : O excellent !
HERMIA : Sweet , do not scorn her so .
DEMETRIUS : If she cannot entreat , I can compel .
LYSANDER : Thou canst compel no more than she entreat : Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers . Helen , I love thee ; by my life , I do : I swear by that which I will lose for thee , To prove him false that says I love thee not .
DEMETRIUS : I say I love thee more than he can do .
LYSANDER : If thou say so , withdraw , and prove it too .
DEMETRIUS : Quick , come !
HERMIA : Lysander , whereto tends all this ?
LYSANDER : Away , you Ethiope !
DEMETRIUS : No , no ; he 'll Seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow , But yet come not : you are a tame man , go !
LYSANDER : Hang off , thou cat , thou burr ! vile thing , let loose , Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent !
HERMIA : Why are you grown so rude ? what change is this ? Sweet love , --
LYSANDER : Thy love ! out , tawny Tartar , out ! Out , loathed medicine ! hated potion , hence !
HERMIA : Do you not jest ?
HELENA : Yes , sooth ; and so do you .
LYSANDER : Demetrius , I will keep my word with thee .
DEMETRIUS : I would I had your bond , for I perceive A weak bond holds you : I 'll not trust your word .
LYSANDER : What , should I hurt her , strike her , kill her dead ? Although I hate her , I 'll not harm her so .
HERMIA : What , can you do me greater harm than hate ? Hate me ! wherefore ? O me ! what news , my love ! Am not I Hermia ? are not you Lysander ? I am as fair now as I was erewhile . Since night you loved me ; yet since night you left me : Why , then you left me--O , the gods forbid ! -- In earnest , shall I say ?
LYSANDER : Ay , by my life ; And never did desire to see thee more . Therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt ; Be certain , nothing truer ; ' tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena .
HERMIA : O me ! you juggler ! you canker-blossom ! You thief of love ! what , have you come by night And stolen my love 's heart from him ?
HELENA : Fine , i 'faith ! Have you no modesty , no maiden shame , No touch of bashfulness ? What , will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue ? Fie , fie ! you counterfeit , you puppet , you !
HERMIA : Puppet ? why so ? ay , that way goes the game . Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures ; she hath urged her height ; And with her personage , her tall personage , Her height , forsooth , she hath prevail 'd with him . And are you grown so high in his esteem ; Because I am so dwarfish and so low ? How low am I , thou painted maypole ? speak ; How low am I ? I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes .
HELENA : I pray you , though you mock me , gentlemen , Let her not hurt me : I was never curst ; I have no gift at all in shrewishness ; I am a right maid for my cowardice : Let her not strike me . You perhaps may think , Because she is something lower than myself , That I can match her .
HERMIA : Lower ! hark , again .
