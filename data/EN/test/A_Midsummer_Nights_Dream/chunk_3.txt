QUINCE : Is all our company here ?
BOTTOM : You were best to call them generally , man by man , according to the scrip .
QUINCE : Here is the scroll of every man 's name , which is thought fit , through all Athens , to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess , on his wedding-day at night .
BOTTOM : First , good Peter Quince , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .
QUINCE : Marry , our play is , The most lamentable comedy , and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby .
BOTTOM : A very good piece of work , I assure you , and a merry . Now , good Peter Quince , call forth your actors by the scroll . Masters , spread yourselves .
QUINCE : Answer as I call you . Nick Bottom , the weaver .
BOTTOM : Ready . Name what part I am for , and proceed .
QUINCE : You , Nick Bottom , are set down for Pyramus .
BOTTOM : What is Pyramus ? a lover , or a tyrant ?
QUINCE : A lover , that kills himself most gallant for love .
BOTTOM : That will ask some tears in the true performing of it : if I do it , let the audience look to their eyes ; I will move storms , I will condole in some measure . To the rest : yet my chief humour is for a tyrant : I could play Ercles rarely , or a part to tear a cat in , to make all split . The raging rocks And shivering shocks Shall break the locks Of prison gates ; And Phibbus ' car Shall shine from far And make and mar The foolish Fates . This was lofty ! Now name the rest of the players . This is Ercles ' vein , a tyrant 's vein ; a lover is more condoling .
QUINCE : Francis Flute , the bellows-mender .
FLUTE : Here , Peter Quince .
QUINCE : Flute , you must take Thisby on you .
FLUTE : What is Thisby ? a wandering knight ?
QUINCE : It is the lady that Pyramus must love .
FLUTE : Nay , faith , let me not play a woman ; I have a beard coming .
QUINCE : That 's all one : you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
BOTTOM : An I may hide my face , let me play Thisby too , I 'll speak in a monstrous little voice . ' Thisne , Thisne ; ' ' Ah , Pyramus , lover dear ! thy Thisby dear , and lady dear ! '
QUINCE : No , no ; you must play Pyramus : and , Flute , you Thisby .
BOTTOM : Well , proceed .
QUINCE : Robin Starveling , the tailor .
STARVELING : Here , Peter Quince .
QUINCE : Robin Starveling , you must play Thisby 's mother . Tom Snout , the tinker .
SNOUT : Here , Peter Quince .
QUINCE : You , Pyramus ' father : myself , Thisby 's father : Snug , the joiner ; you , the lion 's part : and , I hope , here is a play fitted .
SNUG : Have you the lion 's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for I am slow of study .
QUINCE : You may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring .
BOTTOM : Let me play the lion too : I will roar , that I will do any man 's heart good to hear me ; I will roar , that I will make the duke say ' Let him roar again , let him roar again . ' 
QUINCE : An you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were enough to hang us all .
ALL : That would hang us , every mother 's son .
