QUINCE : Bless thee , Bottom ! bless thee ! thou art translated . Exit
BOTTOM : I see their knavery : this is to make an ass of me ; to fright me , if they could . But I will not stir from this place , do what they can : I will walk up and down here , and I will sing , that they shall hear I am not afraid . Sings The ousel cock so black of hue , With orange-tawny bill , The throstle with his note so true , The wren with little quill , --
TITANIA : What angel wakes me from my flowery bed ?
BOTTOM : The finch , the sparrow and the lark , The plain-song cuckoo gray , Whose note full many a man doth mark , And dares not answer nay ; -- for , indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ? who would give a bird the lie , though he cry ' cuckoo ' never so ?
TITANIA : I pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again : Mine ear is much enamour 'd of thy note ; So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; And thy fair virtue 's force perforce doth move me On the first view to say , to swear , I love thee .
BOTTOM : Methinks , mistress , you should have little reason for that : and yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together now-a-days ; the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends . Nay , I can gleek upon occasion .
TITANIA : Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
BOTTOM : Not so , neither : but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood , I have enough to serve mine own turn .
TITANIA : Out of this wood do not desire to go : Thou shalt remain here , whether thou wilt or no . I am a spirit of no common rate ; The summer still doth tend upon my state ; And I do love thee : therefore , go with me ; I 'll give thee fairies to attend on thee , And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep , And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep ; And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go . Peaseblossom ! Cobweb ! Moth ! and Mustardseed ! Enter PEASEBLOSSOM , COBWEB , MOTH , and MUSTARDSEED
PEASEBLOSSOM : Ready .
COBWEB : And I.
MOTH : And I.
MUSTARDSEED : And I.
ALL : Where shall we go ?
TITANIA : Be kind and courteous to this gentleman ; Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes ; Feed him with apricocks and dewberries , With purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees , And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glow-worm 's eyes , To have my love to bed and to arise ; And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes : Nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
PEASEBLOSSOM : Hail , mortal !
COBWEB : Hail !
MOTH : Hail !
MUSTARDSEED : Hail !
BOTTOM : I cry your worship 's mercy , heartily : I beseech your worship 's name .
COBWEB : Cobweb .
BOTTOM : I shall desire you of more acquaintance , good Master Cobweb : if I cut my finger , I shall make bold with you . Your name , honest gentleman ?
PEASEBLOSSOM : Peaseblossom .
BOTTOM : I pray you , commend me to Mistress Squash , your mother , and to Master Peascod , your father . Good Master Peaseblossom , I shall desire you of more acquaintance too . Your name , I beseech you , sir ?
MUSTARDSEED : Mustardseed .
BOTTOM : Good Master Mustardseed , I know your patience well : that same cowardly , giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house : I promise you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now . I desire your more acquaintance , good Master Mustardseed .
