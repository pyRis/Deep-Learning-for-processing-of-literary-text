Prologue : Gentles , perchance you wonder at this show ; But wonder on , till truth make all things plain . This man is Pyramus , if you would know ; This beauteous lady Thisby is certain . This man , with lime and rough-cast , doth present Wall , that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder ; And through Wall 's chink , poor souls , they are content To whisper . At the which let no man wonder . This man , with lanthorn , dog , and bush of thorn , Presenteth Moonshine ; for , if you will know , By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus ' tomb , there , there to woo . This grisly beast , which Lion hight by name , The trusty Thisby , coming first by night , Did scare away , or rather did affright ; And , as she fled , her mantle she did fall , Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain . Anon comes Pyramus , sweet youth and tall , And finds his trusty Thisby 's mantle slain : Whereat , with blade , with bloody blameful blade , He bravely broach 'd is boiling bloody breast ; And Thisby , tarrying in mulberry shade , His dagger drew , and died . For all the rest , Let Lion , Moonshine , Wall , and lovers twain At large discourse , while here they do remain .
THESEUS : I wonder if the lion be to speak .
DEMETRIUS : No wonder , my lord : one lion may , when many asses do .
Wall : In this same interlude it doth befall That I , one Snout by name , present a wall ; And such a wall , as I would have you think , That had in it a crannied hole or chink , Through which the lovers , Pyramus and Thisby , Did whisper often very secretly . This loam , this rough-cast and this stone doth show That I am that same wall ; the truth is so : And this the cranny is , right and sinister , Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper .
THESEUS : Would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?
DEMETRIUS : It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse , my lord . Enter Pyramus
THESEUS : Pyramus draws near the wall : silence !
Pyramus : O grim-look 'd night ! O night with hue so black ! O night , which ever art when day is not ! O night , O night ! alack , alack , alack , I fear my Thisby 's promise is forgot ! And thou , O wall , O sweet , O lovely wall , That stand 'st between her father 's ground and mine ! Thou wall , O wall , O sweet and lovely wall , Show me thy chink , to blink through with mine eyne ! Wall holds up his fingers Thanks , courteous wall : Jove shield thee well for this ! But what see I ? No Thisby do I see . O wicked wall , through whom I see no bliss ! Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
THESEUS : The wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
Pyramus : No , in truth , sir , he should not . ' Deceiving me ' is Thisby 's cue : she is to enter now , and I am to spy her through the wall . You shall see , it will fall pat as I told you . Yonder she comes . Enter Thisbe
Thisbe : O wall , full often hast thou heard my moans , For parting my fair Pyramus and me ! My cherry lips have often kiss 'd thy stones , Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee .
Pyramus : I see a voice : now will I to the chink , To spy an I can hear my Thisby 's face . Thisby !
Thisbe : My love thou art , my love I think .
Pyramus : Think what thou wilt , I am thy lover 's grace ; And , like Limander , am I trusty still .
Thisbe : And I like Helen , till the Fates me kill .
Pyramus : Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true .
Thisbe : As Shafalus to Procrus , I to you .
Pyramus : O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall !
Thisbe : I kiss the wall 's hole , not your lips at all .
Pyramus : Wilt thou at Ninny 's tomb meet me straightway ?
Thisbe : ' Tide life , ' tide death , I come without delay .
Wall : Thus have I , Wall , my part discharged so ; And , being done , thus Wall away doth go . Exit
THESEUS : Now is the mural down between the two neighbours .
DEMETRIUS : No remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning .
HIPPOLYTA : This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard .
THESEUS : The best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them .
HIPPOLYTA : It must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
THESEUS : If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men . Here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion . Enter Lion and Moonshine
