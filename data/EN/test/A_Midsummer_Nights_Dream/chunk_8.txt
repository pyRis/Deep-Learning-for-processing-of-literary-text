OBERON : What thou seest when thou dost wake , Do it for thy true-love take , Love and languish for his sake : Be it ounce , or cat , or bear , Pard , or boar with bristled hair , In thy eye that shall appear When thou wakest , it is thy dear : Wake when some vile thing is near . Exit Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA
LYSANDER : Fair love , you faint with wandering in the wood ; And to speak troth , I have forgot our way : We 'll rest us , Hermia , if you think it good , And tarry for the comfort of the day .
HERMIA : Be it so , Lysander : find you out a bed ; For I upon this bank will rest my head .
LYSANDER : One turf shall serve as pillow for us both ; One heart , one bed , two bosoms and one troth .
HERMIA : Nay , good Lysander ; for my sake , my dear , Lie further off yet , do not lie so near .
LYSANDER : O , take the sense , sweet , of my innocence ! Love takes the meaning in love 's conference . I mean , that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it ; Two bosoms interchained with an oath ; So then two bosoms and a single troth . Then by your side no bed-room me deny ; For lying so , Hermia , I do not lie .
HERMIA : Lysander riddles very prettily : Now much beshrew my manners and my pride , If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied . But , gentle friend , for love and courtesy Lie further off ; in human modesty , Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid , So far be distant ; and , good night , sweet friend : Thy love ne 'er alter till thy sweet life end !
LYSANDER : Amen , amen , to that fair prayer , say I ; And then end life when I end loyalty ! Here is my bed : sleep give thee all his rest !
HERMIA : With half that wish the wisher 's eyes be press 'd ! They sleep Enter PUCK
PUCK : Through the forest have I gone . But Athenian found I none , On whose eyes I might approve This flower 's force in stirring love . Night and silence.--Who is here ? Weeds of Athens he doth wear : This is he , my master said , Despised the Athenian maid ; And here the maiden , sleeping sound , On the dank and dirty ground . Pretty soul ! she durst not lie Near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . Churl , upon thy eyes I throw All the power this charm doth owe . When thou wakest , let love forbid Sleep his seat on thy eyelid : So awake when I am gone ; For I must now to Oberon . Exit Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA , running
HELENA : Stay , though thou kill me , sweet Demetrius .
DEMETRIUS : I charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
HELENA : O , wilt thou darkling leave me ? do not so .
DEMETRIUS : Stay , on thy peril : I alone will go . Exit
HELENA : O , I am out of breath in this fond chase ! The more my prayer , the lesser is my grace . Happy is Hermia , wheresoe 'er she lies ; For she hath blessed and attractive eyes . How came her eyes so bright ? Not with salt tears : If so , my eyes are oftener wash 'd than hers . No , no , I am as ugly as a bear ; For beasts that meet me run away for fear : Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do , as a monster fly my presence thus . What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia 's sphery eyne ? But who is here ? Lysander ! on the ground ! Dead ? or asleep ? I see no blood , no wound . Lysander if you live , good sir , awake .
LYSANDER : And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake . Transparent Helena ! Nature shows art , That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart . Where is Demetrius ? O , how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword !
HELENA : Do not say so , Lysander ; say not so What though he love your Hermia ? Lord , what though ? Yet Hermia still loves you : then be content .
