TITANIA : Come , wait upon him ; lead him to my bower . The moon methinks looks with a watery eye ; And when she weeps , weeps every little flower , Lamenting some enforced chastity . Tie up my love 's tongue bring him silently . Enter OBERON
OBERON : I wonder if Titania be awaked ; Then , what it was that next came in her eye , Which she must dote on in extremity . Enter PUCK Here comes my messenger . How now , mad spirit ! What night-rule now about this haunted grove ?
PUCK : My mistress with a monster is in love . Near to her close and consecrated bower , While she was in her dull and sleeping hour , A crew of patches , rude mechanicals , That work for bread upon Athenian stalls , Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus ' nuptial-day . The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort , Who Pyramus presented , in their sport Forsook his scene and enter 'd in a brake When I did him at this advantage take , An ass 's nole I fixed on his head : Anon his Thisbe must be answered , And forth my mimic comes . When they him spy , As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , Or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , Rising and cawing at the gun 's report , Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , So , at his sight , away his fellows fly ; And , at our stamp , here o 'er and o 'er one falls ; He murder cries and help from Athens calls . Their sense thus weak , lost with their fears thus strong , Made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; Some sleeves , some hats , from yielders all things catch . I led them on in this distracted fear , And left sweet Pyramus translated there : When in that moment , so it came to pass , Titania waked and straightway loved an ass .
OBERON : This falls out better than I could devise . But hast thou yet latch 'd the Athenian 's eyes With the love-juice , as I did bid thee do ?
PUCK : I took him sleeping , --that is finish 'd too , -- And the Athenian woman by his side : That , when he waked , of force she must be eyed . Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS
OBERON : Stand close : this is the same Athenian .
PUCK : This is the woman , but not this the man .
DEMETRIUS : O , why rebuke you him that loves you so ? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
HERMIA : Now I but chide ; but I should use thee worse , For thou , I fear , hast given me cause to curse , If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep , Being o 'er shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , And kill me too . The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me : would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia ? I 'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bored and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brother 's noontide with Antipodes . It cannot be but thou hast murder 'd him ; So should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
DEMETRIUS : So should the murder 'd look , and so should I , Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty : Yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere .
HERMIA : What 's this to my Lysander ? where is he ? Ah , good Demetrius , wilt thou give him me ?
DEMETRIUS : I had rather give his carcass to my hounds .
HERMIA : Out , dog ! out , cur ! thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden 's patience . Hast thou slain him , then ? Henceforth be never number 'd among men ! O , once tell true , tell true , even for my sake ! Durst thou have look 'd upon him being awake , And hast thou kill 'd him sleeping ? O brave touch ! Could not a worm , an adder , do so much ? An adder did it ; for with doubler tongue Than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
