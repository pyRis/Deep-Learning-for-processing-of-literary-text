THESEUS : Now , fair Hippolyta , our nuptial hour Draws on apace ; four happy days bring in Another moon : but , O , methinks , how slow This old moon wanes ! she lingers my desires , Like to a step-dame or a dowager Long withering out a young man revenue .
HIPPOLYTA : Four days will quickly steep themselves in night ; Four nights will quickly dream away the time ; And then the moon , like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven , shall behold the night Of our solemnities .
THESEUS : Go , Philostrate , Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments ; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth ; Turn melancholy forth to funerals ; The pale companion is not for our pomp . Exit PHILOSTRATE Hippolyta , I woo 'd thee with my sword , And won thy love , doing thee injuries ; But I will wed thee in another key , With pomp , with triumph and with revelling . Enter EGEUS , HERMIA , LYSANDER , and DEMETRIUS
EGEUS : Happy be Theseus , our renowned duke !
THESEUS : Thanks , good Egeus : what 's the news with thee ?
EGEUS : Full of vexation come I , with complaint Against my child , my daughter Hermia . Stand forth , Demetrius . My noble lord , This man hath my consent to marry her . Stand forth , Lysander : and my gracious duke , This man hath bewitch 'd the bosom of my child ; Thou , thou , Lysander , thou hast given her rhymes , And interchanged love-tokens with my child : Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , With feigning voice verses of feigning love , And stolen the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair , rings , gawds , conceits , Knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers Of strong prevailment in unharden 'd youth : With cunning hast thou filch 'd my daughter 's heart , Turn 'd her obedience , which is due to me , To stubborn harshness : and , my gracious duke , Be it so she ; will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius , I beg the ancient privilege of Athens , As she is mine , I may dispose of her : Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death , according to our law Immediately provided in that case .
THESEUS : What say you , Hermia ? be advised fair maid : To you your father should be as a god ; One that composed your beauties , yea , and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it . Demetrius is a worthy gentleman .
HERMIA : So is Lysander .
THESEUS : In himself he is ; But in this kind , wanting your father 's voice , The other must be held the worthier .
HERMIA : I would my father look 'd but with my eyes .
THESEUS : Rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
HERMIA : I do entreat your grace to pardon me . I know not by what power I am made bold , Nor how it may concern my modesty , In such a presence here to plead my thoughts ; But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case , If I refuse to wed Demetrius .
THESEUS : Either to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men . Therefore , fair Hermia , question your desires ; Know of your youth , examine well your blood , Whether , if you yield not to your father 's choice , You can endure the livery of a nun , For aye to be in shady cloister mew 'd , To live a barren sister all your life , Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon . Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood , To undergo such maiden pilgrimage ; But earthlier happy is the rose distill 'd , Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows , lives and dies in single blessedness .
