THESEUS : What are they that do play it ?
PHILOSTRATE : Hard-handed men that work in Athens here , Which never labour 'd in their minds till now , And now have toil 'd their unbreathed memories With this same play , against your nuptial .
THESEUS : And we will hear it .
PHILOSTRATE : No , my noble lord ; It is not for you : I have heard it over , And it is nothing , nothing in the world ; Unless you can find sport in their intents , Extremely stretch 'd and conn 'd with cruel pain , To do you service .
THESEUS : I will hear that play ; For never anything can be amiss , When simpleness and duty tender it . Go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . Exit PHILOSTRATE
HIPPOLYTA : I love not to see wretchedness o 'er charged And duty in his service perishing .
THESEUS : Why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
HIPPOLYTA : He says they can do nothing in this kind .
THESEUS : The kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing . Our sport shall be to take what they mistake : And what poor duty cannot do , noble respect Takes it in might , not merit . Where I have come , great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes ; Where I have seen them shiver and look pale , Make periods in the midst of sentences , Throttle their practised accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off , Not paying me a welcome . Trust me , sweet , Out of this silence yet I pick 'd a welcome ; And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence . Love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most , to my capacity . Re-enter PHILOSTRATE
PHILOSTRATE : So please your grace , the Prologue is address 'd .
THESEUS : Let him approach . Flourish of trumpets Enter QUINCE for the Prologue
Prologue : If we offend , it is with our good will . That you should think , we come not to offend , But with good will . To show our simple skill , That is the true beginning of our end . Consider then we come but in despite . We do not come as minding to contest you , Our true intent is . All for your delight We are not here . That you should here repent you , The actors are at hand and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know .
THESEUS : This fellow doth not stand upon points .
LYSANDER : He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt ; he knows not the stop . A good moral , my lord : it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
HIPPOLYTA : Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder ; a sound , but not in government .
THESEUS : His speech , was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . Who is next ? Enter Pyramus and Thisbe , Wall , Moonshine , and Lion
