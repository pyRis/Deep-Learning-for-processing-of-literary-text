BOTTOM : Nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion 's neck : and he himself must speak through , saying thus , or to the same defect , -- ' Ladies , ' --or ' Fair-ladies--I would wish You , ' --or ' I would request you , ' --or ' I would entreat you , --not to fear , not to tremble : my life for yours . If you think I come hither as a lion , it were pity of my life : no I am no such thing ; I am a man as other men are ; ' and there indeed let him name his name , and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner .
QUINCE : Well it shall be so . But there is two hard things ; that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber ; for , you know , Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight .
SNOUT : Doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?
BOTTOM : A calendar , a calendar ! look in the almanac ; find out moonshine , find out moonshine .
QUINCE : Yes , it doth shine that night .
BOTTOM : Why , then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window , where we play , open , and the moon may shine in at the casement .
QUINCE : Ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn , and say he comes to disfigure , or to present , the person of Moonshine . Then , there is another thing : we must have a wall in the great chamber ; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story , did talk through the chink of a wall .
SNOUT : You can never bring in a wall . What say you , Bottom ?
BOTTOM : Some man or other must present Wall : and let him have some plaster , or some loam , or some rough-cast about him , to signify wall ; and let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper .
QUINCE : If that may be , then all is well . Come , sit down , every mother 's son , and rehearse your parts . Pyramus , you begin : when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake : and so every one according to his cue . Enter PUCK behind
PUCK : What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here , So near the cradle of the fairy queen ? What , a play toward ! I 'll be an auditor ; An actor too , perhaps , if I see cause .
QUINCE : Speak , Pyramus . Thisby , stand forth .
BOTTOM : Thisby , the flowers of odious savours sweet , --
QUINCE : Odours , odours .
BOTTOM : --odours savours sweet : So hath thy breath , my dearest Thisby dear . But hark , a voice ! stay thou but here awhile , And by and by I will to thee appear . Exit
PUCK : A stranger Pyramus than e 'er played here . Exit
FLUTE : Must I speak now ?
QUINCE : Ay , marry , must you ; for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .
FLUTE : Most radiant Pyramus , most lily-white of hue , Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier , Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew , As true as truest horse that yet would never tire , I 'll meet thee , Pyramus , at Ninny 's tomb .
QUINCE : ' Ninus ' tomb , ' man : why , you must not speak that yet ; that you answer to Pyramus : you speak all your part at once , cues and all Pyramus enter : your cue is past ; it is , ' never tire . ' 
FLUTE : O , --As true as truest horse , that yet would never tire . Re-enter PUCK , and BOTTOM with an ass 's head
BOTTOM : If I were fair , Thisby , I were only thine .
QUINCE : O monstrous ! O strange ! we are haunted . Pray , masters ! fly , masters ! Help !
PUCK : I 'll follow you , I 'll lead you about a round , Through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier : Sometime a horse I 'll be , sometime a hound , A hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; And neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , Like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . Exit
BOTTOM : Why do they run away ? this is a knavery of them to make me afeard . Re-enter SNOUT
SNOUT : O Bottom , thou art changed ! what do I see on thee ?
