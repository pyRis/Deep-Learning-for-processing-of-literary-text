PUCK : Fairy king , attend , and mark : I do hear the morning lark .
OBERON : Then , my queen , in silence sad , Trip we after the night 's shade : We the globe can compass soon , Swifter than the wandering moon .
TITANIA : Come , my lord , and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground . Horns winded within Enter THESEUS , HIPPOLYTA , EGEUS , and train
THESEUS : Go , one of you , find out the forester ; For now our observation is perform 'd ; And since we have the vaward of the day , My love shall hear the music of my hounds . Uncouple in the western valley ; let them go : Dispatch , I say , and find the forester . Exit an Attendant We will , fair queen , up to the mountain 's top , And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction .
HIPPOLYTA : I was with Hercules and Cadmus once , When in a wood of Crete they bay 'd the bear With hounds of Sparta : never did I hear Such gallant chiding : for , besides the groves , The skies , the fountains , every region near Seem 'd all one mutual cry : I never heard So musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
THESEUS : My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind , So flew 'd , so sanded , and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew ; Crook-knee 'd , and dew-lapp 'd like Thessalian bulls ; Slow in pursuit , but match 'd in mouth like bells , Each under each . A cry more tuneable Was never holla 'd to , nor cheer 'd with horn , In Crete , in Sparta , nor in Thessaly : Judge when you hear . But , soft ! what nymphs are these ?
EGEUS : My lord , this is my daughter here asleep ; And this , Lysander ; this Demetrius is ; This Helena , old Nedar 's Helena : I wonder of their being here together .
THESEUS : No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May , and hearing our intent , Came here in grace our solemnity . But speak , Egeus ; is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice ?
EGEUS : It is , my lord .
THESEUS : Go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . Horns and shout within . LYSANDER , DEMETRIUS , HELENA , and HERMIA wake and start up Good morrow , friends . Saint Valentine is past : Begin these wood-birds but to couple now ?
LYSANDER : Pardon , my lord .
THESEUS : I pray you all , stand up . I know you two are rival enemies : How comes this gentle concord in the world , That hatred is so far from jealousy , To sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ?
LYSANDER : My lord , I shall reply amazedly , Half sleep , half waking : but as yet , I swear , I cannot truly say how I came here ; But , as I think , --for truly would I speak , And now do I bethink me , so it is , -- I came with Hermia hither : our intent Was to be gone from Athens , where we might , Without the peril of the Athenian law .
EGEUS : Enough , enough , my lord ; you have enough : I beg the law , the law , upon his head . They would have stolen away ; they would , Demetrius , Thereby to have defeated you and me , You of your wife and me of my consent , Of my consent that she should be your wife .
