HERMIA : So will I grow , so live , so die , my lord , Ere I will my virgin patent up Unto his lordship , whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty .
THESEUS : Take time to pause ; and , by the next new moon-- The sealing-day betwixt my love and me , For everlasting bond of fellowship-- Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father 's will , Or else to wed Demetrius , as he would ; Or on Diana 's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life .
DEMETRIUS : Relent , sweet Hermia : and , Lysander , yield Thy crazed title to my certain right .
LYSANDER : You have her father 's love , Demetrius ; Let me have Hermia 's : do you marry him .
EGEUS : Scornful Lysander ! true , he hath my love , And what is mine my love shall render him . And she is mine , and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius .
LYSANDER : I am , my lord , as well derived as he , As well possess 'd ; my love is more than his ; My fortunes every way as fairly rank 'd , If not with vantage , as Demetrius ' ; And , which is more than all these boasts can be , I am beloved of beauteous Hermia : Why should not I then prosecute my right ? Demetrius , I 'll avouch it to his head , Made love to Nedar 's daughter , Helena , And won her soul ; and she , sweet lady , dotes , Devoutly dotes , dotes in idolatry , Upon this spotted and inconstant man .
THESEUS : I must confess that I have heard so much , And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof ; But , being over-full of self-affairs , My mind did lose it . But , Demetrius , come ; And come , Egeus ; you shall go with me , I have some private schooling for you both . For you , fair Hermia , look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father 's will ; Or else the law of Athens yields you up-- Which by no means we may extenuate-- To death , or to a vow of single life . Come , my Hippolyta : what cheer , my love ? Demetrius and Egeus , go along : I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
EGEUS : With duty and desire we follow you .
LYSANDER : How now , my love ! why is your cheek so pale ? How chance the roses there do fade so fast ?
HERMIA : Belike for want of rain , which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
LYSANDER : Ay me ! for aught that I could ever read , Could ever hear by tale or history , The course of true love never did run smooth ; But , either it was different in blood , --
HERMIA : O cross ! too high to be enthrall 'd to low .
LYSANDER : Or else misgraffed in respect of years , --
HERMIA : O spite ! too old to be engaged to young .
LYSANDER : Or else it stood upon the choice of friends , --
HERMIA : O hell ! to choose love by another 's eyes .
LYSANDER : Or , if there were a sympathy in choice , War , death , or sickness did lay siege to it , Making it momentany as a sound , Swift as a shadow , short as any dream ; Brief as the lightning in the collied night , That , in a spleen , unfolds both heaven and earth , And ere a man hath power to say ' Behold ! ' The jaws of darkness do devour it up : So quick bright things come to confusion .
HERMIA : If then true lovers have been ever cross 'd , It stands as an edict in destiny : Then let us teach our trial patience , Because it is a customary cross , As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs , Wishes and tears , poor fancy 's followers .
