LYSANDER : Content with Hermia ! No ; I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent . Not Hermia but Helena I love : Who will not change a raven for a dove ? The will of man is by his reason sway 'd ; And reason says you are the worthier maid . Things growing are not ripe until their season So I , being young , till now ripe not to reason ; And touching now the point of human skill , Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes , where I o 'erlook Love 's stories written in love 's richest book .
HELENA : Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born ? When at your hands did I deserve this scorn ? Is 't not enough , is 't not enough , young man , That I did never , no , nor never can , Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius ' eye , But you must flout my insufficiency ? Good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , In such disdainful manner me to woo . But fare you well : perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness . O , that a lady , of one man refused . Should of another therefore be abused ! Exit
LYSANDER : She sees not Hermia . Hermia , sleep thou there : And never mayst thou come Lysander near ! For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings , Or as tie heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive , So thou , my surfeit and my heresy , Of all be hated , but the most of me ! And , all my powers , address your love and might To honour Helen and to be her knight ! Exit
HERMIA : Help me , Lysander , help me ! do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast ! Ay me , for pity ! what a dream was here ! Lysander , look how I do quake with fear : Methought a serpent eat my heart away , And you sat smiling at his cruel pray . Lysander ! what , removed ? Lysander ! lord ! What , out of hearing ? gone ? no sound , no word ? Alack , where are you speak , an if you hear ; Speak , of all loves ! I swoon almost with fear . No ? then I well perceive you all not nigh Either death or you I 'll find immediately . Exit Enter QUINCE , SNUG , BOTTOM , FLUTE , SNOUT , and STARVELING
BOTTOM : Are we all met ?
QUINCE : Pat , pat ; and here 's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal . This green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house ; and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
BOTTOM : Peter Quince , --
QUINCE : What sayest thou , bully Bottom ?
BOTTOM : There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please . First , Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself ; which the ladies cannot abide . How answer you that ?
SNOUT : By 'r lakin , a parlous fear .
STARVELING : I believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
BOTTOM : Not a whit : I have a device to make all well . Write me a prologue ; and let the prologue seem to say , we will do no harm with our swords , and that Pyramus is not killed indeed ; and , for the more better assurance , tell them that I , Pyramus , am not Pyramus , but Bottom the weaver : this will put them out of fear .
QUINCE : Well , we will have such a prologue ; and it shall be written in eight and six .
BOTTOM : No , make it two more ; let it be written in eight and eight .
SNOUT : Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
STARVELING : I fear it , I promise you .
BOTTOM : Masters , you ought to consider with yourselves : to bring in--God shield us ! --a lion among ladies , is a most dreadful thing ; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living ; and we ought to look to ' t .
SNOUT : Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .
