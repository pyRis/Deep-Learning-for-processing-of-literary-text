QUINCE : You can play no part but Pyramus ; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man ; a proper man , as one shall see in a summer 's day ; a most lovely gentleman-like man : therefore you must needs play Pyramus .
BOTTOM : Well , I will undertake it . What beard were I best to play it in ?
QUINCE : Why , what you will .
BOTTOM : I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard , your orange-tawny beard , your purple-in-grain beard , or your French-crown-colour beard , your perfect yellow .
QUINCE : Some of your French crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . But , masters , here are your parts : and I am to entreat you , request you and desire you , to con them by to-morrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city , we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known . In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties , such as our play wants . I pray you , fail me not .
BOTTOM : We will meet ; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously . Take pains ; be perfect : adieu .
QUINCE : At the duke 's oak we meet .
BOTTOM : Enough ; hold or cut bow-strings . Enter , from opposite sides , a Fairy , and PUCK
PUCK : How now , spirit ! whither wander you ?
Fairy : Over hill , over dale , Thorough bush , thorough brier , Over park , over pale , Thorough flood , thorough fire , I do wander everywhere , Swifter than the moon 's sphere ; And I serve the fairy queen , To dew her orbs upon the green . The cowslips tall her pensioners be : In their gold coats spots you see ; Those be rubies , fairy favours , In those freckles live their savours : I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip 's ear . Farewell , thou lob of spirits ; I 'll be gone : Our queen and all our elves come here anon .
PUCK : The king doth keep his revels here to-night : Take heed the queen come not within his sight ; For Oberon is passing fell and wrath , Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy , stolen from an Indian king ; She never had so sweet a changeling ; And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train , to trace the forests wild ; But she perforce withholds the loved boy , Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy : And now they never meet in grove or green , By fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , But , they do square , that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there .
Fairy : Either I mistake your shape and making quite , Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call 'd Robin Goodfellow : are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery ; Skim milk , and sometimes labour in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn ; And sometime make the drink to bear no barm ; Mislead night-wanderers , laughing at their harm ? Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck , You do their work , and they shall have good luck : Are not you he ?
