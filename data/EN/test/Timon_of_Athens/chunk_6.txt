TIMON : Flavius .
FLAVIUS : My lord ?
TIMON : The little casket bring me hither .
FLAVIUS : Yes , my lord . More jewels yet ! There is no crossing him in ' s humour ; Aside Else I should tell him , --well , i ' faith I should , When all 's spent , he ' ld be cross 'd then , an he could . ' Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind , That man might ne 'er be wretched for his mind . Exit
First Lord : Where be our men ?

FLAVIUS : I scarce know how . Enter a Second Servant
Second Servant : May it please your honour , Lord Lucius , Out of his free love , hath presented to you Four milk-white horses , trapp 'd in silver .

Third Servant : Please you , my lord , that honourable gentleman , Lord Lucullus , entreats your company to-morrow to hunt with him , and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds .
TIMON : I 'll hunt with him ; and let them be received , Not without fair reward .
FLAVIUS : What will this come to ? He commands us to provide , and give great gifts , And all out of an empty coffer : Nor will he know his purse , or yield me this , To show him what a beggar his heart is , Being of no power to make his wishes good : His promises fly so beyond his state That what he speaks is all in debt ; he owes For every word : he is so kind that he now Pays interest for ' t ; his land 's put to their books . Well , would I were gently put out of office Before I were forced out ! Happier is he that has no friend to feed Than such that do e 'en enemies exceed . I bleed inwardly for my lord . Exit
TIMON : You do yourselves Much wrong , you bate too much of your own merits : Here , my lord , a trifle of our love .
Second Lord : With more than common thanks I will receive it .
Third Lord : O , he 's the very soul of bounty !
TIMON : And now I remember , my lord , you gave Good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on : it is yours , because you liked it .
Second Lord : O , I beseech you , pardon me , my lord , in that .
TIMON : You may take my word , my lord ; I know , no man Can justly praise but what he does affect : I weigh my friend 's affection with mine own ; I 'll tell you true . I 'll call to you .
All Lords : O , none so welcome .
