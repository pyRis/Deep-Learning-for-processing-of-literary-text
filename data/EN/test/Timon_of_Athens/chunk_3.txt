APEMANTUS : Yes , he is worthy of thee , and to pay thee for thy labour : he that loves to be flattered is worthy o ' the flatterer . Heavens , that I were a lord !
TIMON : What wouldst do then , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : E 'en as Apemantus does now ; hate a lord with my heart .
TIMON : What , thyself ?
APEMANTUS : Ay .
TIMON : Wherefore ?
APEMANTUS : That I had no angry wit to be a lord . Art not thou a merchant ?
Merchant : Ay , Apemantus .
APEMANTUS : Traffic confound thee , if the gods will not !
Merchant : If traffic do it , the gods do it .
APEMANTUS : Traffic 's thy god ; and thy god confound thee ! Trumpet sounds . Enter a Messenger
TIMON : What trumpet 's that ?
Messenger : ' Tis Alcibiades , and some twenty horse , All of companionship .
TIMON : Pray , entertain them ; give them guide to us . You must needs dine with me : go not you hence Till I have thank 'd you : when dinner 's done , Show me this piece . I am joyful of your sights . Enter ALCIBIADES , with the rest Most welcome , sir !
APEMANTUS : So , so , there ! Aches contract and starve your supple joints ! That there should be small love ' mongst these sweet knaves , And all this courtesy ! The strain of man 's bred out Into baboon and monkey .
ALCIBIADES : Sir , you have saved my longing , and I feed Most hungerly on your sight .
TIMON : Right welcome , sir ! Ere we depart , we 'll share a bounteous time In different pleasures . Pray you , let us in . Enter two Lords
First Lord : What time o ' day is 't , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : Time to be honest .
First Lord : That time serves still .
APEMANTUS : The more accursed thou , that still omitt 'st it .
Second Lord : Thou art going to Lord Timon 's feast ?
APEMANTUS : Ay , to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools .
Second Lord : Fare thee well , fare thee well .
APEMANTUS : Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice .
Second Lord : Why , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : Shouldst have kept one to thyself , for I mean to give thee none .
First Lord : Hang thyself !
APEMANTUS : No , I will do nothing at thy bidding : make thy requests to thy friend .
Second Lord : Away , unpeaceable dog , or I 'll spurn thee hence !
APEMANTUS : I will fly , like a dog , the heels o ' the ass . Exit
First Lord : He 's opposite to humanity . Come , shall we in , And taste Lord Timon 's bounty ? he outgoes The very heart of kindness .
Second Lord : He pours it out ; Plutus , the god of gold , Is but his steward : no meed , but he repays Sevenfold above itself ; no gift to him , But breeds the giver a return exceeding All use of quittance .
First Lord : The noblest mind he carries That ever govern 'd man .
Second Lord : Long may he live in fortunes ! Shall we in ?
First Lord : I 'll keep you company . Hautboys playing loud music . A great banquet served in ; FLAVIUS and others attending ; then enter TIMON , ALCIBIADES , Lords , Senators , and VENTIDIUS . Then comes , dropping , after all , APEMANTUS , discontentedly , like himself
VENTIDIUS : Most honour 'd Timon , It hath pleased the gods to remember my father 's age , And call him to long peace . He is gone happy , and has left me rich : Then , as in grateful virtue I am bound To your free heart , I do return those talents , Doubled with thanks and service , from whose help I derived liberty .
