APEMANTUS : There will little learning die then , that day thou art hanged . This is to Lord Timon ; this to Alcibiades . Go ; thou wast born a bastard , and thou 't die a bawd .
Page : Thou wast whelped a dog , and thou shalt famish a dog 's death . Answer not ; I am gone . Exit
APEMANTUS : E 'en so thou outrunnest grace . Fool , I will go with you to Lord Timon 's .
Fool : Will you leave me there ?
APEMANTUS : If Timon stay at home . You three serve three usurers ?
All Servants : Ay ; would they served us !
APEMANTUS : So would I , --as good a trick as ever hangman served thief .
Fool : Are you three usurers ' men ?
All Servants : Ay , fool .
Fool : I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant : my mistress is one , and I am her fool . When men come to borrow of your masters , they approach sadly , and go away merry ; but they enter my mistress ' house merrily , and go away sadly : the reason of this ? Varro 's Servant I could render one .
APEMANTUS : Do it then , that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave ; which not-withstanding , thou shalt be no less esteemed . Varro 's Servant What is a whoremaster , fool ?
Fool : A fool in good clothes , and something like thee . ' Tis a spirit : sometime 't appears like a lord ; sometime like a lawyer ; sometime like a philosopher , with two stones moe than 's artificial one : he is very often like a knight ; and , generally , in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen , this spirit walks in . Varro 's Servant Thou art not altogether a fool .
Fool : Nor thou altogether a wise man : as much foolery as I have , so much wit thou lackest .
APEMANTUS : That answer might have become Apemantus .
All Servants : Aside , aside ; here comes Lord Timon . Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS
APEMANTUS : Come with me , fool , come .
Fool : I do not always follow lover , elder brother and woman ; sometime the philosopher .
FLAVIUS : Pray you , walk near : I 'll speak with you anon .
TIMON : You make me marvel : wherefore ere this time Had you not fully laid my state before me , That I might so have rated my expense , As I had leave of means ?
FLAVIUS : You would not hear me , At many leisures I proposed .
TIMON : Go to : Perchance some single vantages you took . When my indispos ition put you back : And that unaptness made your minister , Thus to excuse yourself .
FLAVIUS : O my good lord , At many times I brought in my accounts , Laid them before you ; you would throw them off , And say , you found them in mine honesty . When , for some trifling present , you have bid me Return so much , I have shook my head and wept ; Yea , ' gainst the authority of manners , pray 'd you To hold your hand more close : I did endure Not seldom , nor no slight cheques , when I have Prompted you in the ebb of your estate And your great flow of debts . My loved lord , Though you hear now , too late--yet now 's a time-- The greatest of your having lacks a half To pay your present debts .
TIMON : Let all my land be sold .
FLAVIUS : ' Tis all engaged , some forfeited and gone ; And what remains will hardly stop the mouth Of present dues : the future comes apace : What shall defend the interim ? and at length How goes our reckoning ?
TIMON : To Lacedaemon did my land extend .
FLAVIUS : O my good lord , the world is but a word : Were it all yours to give it in a breath , How quickly were it gone !
TIMON : You tell me true .
