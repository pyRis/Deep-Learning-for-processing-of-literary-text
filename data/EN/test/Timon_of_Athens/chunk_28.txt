TIMON : I thank them ; and would send them back the plague , Could I but catch it for them .
First Senator : O , forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee . The senators with one consent of love Entreat thee back to Athens ; who have thought On special dignities , which vacant lie For thy best use and wearing .
Second Senator : They confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general , gross : Which now the public body , which doth seldom Play the recanter , feeling in itself A lack of Timon 's aid , hath sense withal Of its own fail , restraining aid to Timon ; And send forth us , to make their sorrow 'd render , Together with a recompense more fruitful Than their offence can weigh down by the dram ; Ay , even such heaps and sums of love and wealth As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs And write in thee the figures of their love , Ever to read them thine .
TIMON : You witch me in it ; Surprise me to the very brink of tears : Lend me a fool 's heart and a woman 's eyes , And I 'll beweep these comforts , worthy senators .
First Senator : Therefore , so please thee to return with us And of our Athens , thine and ours , to take The captainship , thou shalt be met with thanks , Allow 'd with absolute power and thy good name Live with authority : so soon we shall drive back Of Alcibiades the approaches wild , Who , like a boar too savage , doth root up His country 's peace .
Second Senator : And shakes his threatening sword Against the walls of Athens .
First Senator : Therefore , Timon , --
TIMON : Well , sir , I will ; therefore , I will , sir ; thus : If Alcibiades kill my countrymen , Let Alcibiades know this of Timon , That Timon cares not . But if be sack fair Athens , And take our goodly aged men by the beards , Giving our holy virgins to the stain Of contumelious , beastly , mad-brain 'd war , Then let him know , and tell him Timon speaks it , In pity of our aged and our youth , I cannot choose but tell him , that I care not , And let him take 't at worst ; for their knives care not , While you have throats to answer : for myself , There 's not a whittle in the unruly camp But I do prize it at my love before The reverend 'st throat in Athens . So I leave you To the protection of the prosperous gods , As thieves to keepers .
FLAVIUS : Stay not , all 's in vain .
TIMON : Why , I was writing of my epitaph ; it will be seen to-morrow : my long sickness Of health and living now begins to mend , And nothing brings me all things . Go , live still ; Be Alcibiades your plague , you his , And last so long enough !
First Senator : We speak in vain .
TIMON : But yet I love my country , and am not One that rejoices in the common wreck , As common bruit doth put it .
First Senator : That 's well spoke .
TIMON : Commend me to my loving countrymen , --
First Senator : These words become your lips as they pass thorough them .
Second Senator : And enter in our ears like great triumphers In their applauding gates .
TIMON : Commend me to them , And tell them that , to ease them of their griefs , Their fears of hostile strokes , their aches , losses , Their pangs of love , with other incident throes That nature 's fragile vessel doth sustain In life 's uncertain voyage , I will some kindness do them : I 'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades ' wrath .
First Senator : I like this well ; he will return again .
