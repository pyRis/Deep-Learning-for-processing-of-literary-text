Second Servant : My lord , --
TIMON : Tear me , take me , and the gods fall upon you ! Exit
HORTENSIUS : ' Faith , I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money : these debts may well be called desperate ones , for a madman owes ' em . Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS
TIMON : They have e 'en put my breath from me , the slaves . Creditors ? devils !
FLAVIUS : My dear lord , --
TIMON : What if it should be so ?
FLAVIUS : My lord , --
TIMON : I 'll have it so . My steward !
FLAVIUS : Here , my lord .
TIMON : So fitly ? Go , bid all my friends again , Lucius , Lucullus , and Sempronius : All , sirrah , all : I 'll once more feast the rascals .
FLAVIUS : O my lord , You only speak from your distracted soul ; There is not so much left , to furnish out A moderate table .
TIMON : Be 't not in thy care ; go , I charge thee , invite them all : let in the tide Of knaves once more ; my cook and I 'll provide .
First Senator : My lord , you have my voice to it ; the fault 's Bloody ; ' tis necessary he should die : Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy .
Second Senator : Most true ; the law shall bruise him . Enter ALCIBIADES , with Attendants
ALCIBIADES : Honour , health , and compassion to the senate !
First Senator : Now , captain ?
ALCIBIADES : I am an humble suitor to your virtues ; For pity is the virtue of the law , And none but tyrants use it cruelly . It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine , who , in hot blood , Hath stepp 'd into the law , which is past depth To those that , without heed , do plunge into ' t . He is a man , setting his fate aside , Of comely virtues : Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice-- An honour in him which buys out his fault-- But with a noble fury and fair spirit , Seeing his reputation touch 'd to death , He did oppose his foe : And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behave his anger , ere ' twas spent , As if he had but proved an argument .
First Senator : You undergo too strict a paradox , Striving to make an ugly deed look fair : Your words have took such pains as if they labour 'd To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling Upon the head of valour ; which indeed Is valour misbegot and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born : He 's truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe , and make his wrongs His outsides , to wear them like his raiment , carelessly , And ne 'er prefer his injuries to his heart , To bring it into danger . If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill , What folly ' tis to hazard life for ill !
ALCIBIADES : My lord , --
First Senator : You cannot make gross sins look clear : To revenge is no valour , but to bear .
ALCIBIADES : My lords , then , under favour , pardon me , If I speak like a captain . Why do fond men expose themselves to battle , And not endure all threats ? sleep upon 't , And let the foes quietly cut their throats , Without repugnancy ? If there be Such valour in the bearing , what make we Abroad ? why then , women are more valiant That stay at home , if bearing carry it , And the ass more captain than the lion , the felon Loaden with irons wiser than the judge , If wisdom be in suffering . O my lords , As you are great , be pitifully good : Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood ? To kill , I grant , is sin 's extremest gust ; But , in defence , by mercy , ' tis most just . To be in anger is impiety ; But who is man that is not angry ? Weigh but the crime with this .
