FLAVIUS : Good fellows all , The latest of my wealth I 'll share amongst you . Wherever we shall meet , for Timon 's sake , Let 's yet be fellows ; let 's shake our heads , and say , As ' twere a knell unto our master 's fortunes , ' We have seen better days . ' Let each take some ; Nay , put out all your hands . Not one word more : Thus part we rich in sorrow , parting poor . Servants embrace , and part several ways O , the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us ! Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt , Since riches point to misery and contempt ? Who would be so mock 'd with glory ? or to live But in a dream of friendship ? To have his pomp and all what state compounds But only painted , like his varnish 'd friends ? Poor honest lord , brought low by his own heart , Undone by goodness ! Strange , unusual blood , When man 's worst sin is , he does too much good ! Who , then , dares to be half so kind again ? For bounty , that makes gods , does still mar men . My dearest lord , bless 'd , to be most accursed , Rich , only to be wretched , thy great fortunes Are made thy chief afflictions . Alas , kind lord ! He 's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat Of monstrous friends , nor has he with him to Supply his life , or that which can command it . I 'll follow and inquire him out : I 'll ever serve his mind with my best will ; Whilst I have gold , I 'll be his steward still . Exit Enter TIMON , from the cave O blessed breeding sun , draw from the earth Rotten humidity ; below thy sister 's orb Infect the air ! Twinn 'd brothers of one womb , Whose procreation , residence , and birth , Scarce is dividant , touch them with several fortunes ; The greater scorns the lesser : not nature , To whom all sores lay siege , can bear great fortune , But by contempt of nature . Raise me this beggar , and deny ' t that lord ; The senator shall bear contempt hereditary , The beggar native honour . It is the pasture lards the rother 's sides , The want that makes him lean . Who dares , who dares , In purity of manhood stand upright , And say ' This man 's a flatterer ? ' if one be , So are they all ; for every grise of fortune Is smooth 'd by that below : the learned pate Ducks to the golden fool : all is oblique ; There 's nothing level in our cursed natures , But direct villany . Therefore , be abhorr 'd All feasts , societies , and throngs of men ! His semblable , yea , himself , Timon disdains : Destruction fang mankind ! Earth , yield me roots ! Digging Who seeks for better of thee , sauce his palate With thy most operant poison ! What is here ? Gold ? yellow , glittering , precious gold ? No , gods , I am no idle votarist : roots , you clear heavens ! Thus much of this will make black white , foul fair , Wrong right , base noble , old young , coward valiant . Ha , you gods ! why this ? what this , you gods ? Why , this Will lug your priests and servants from your sides , Pluck stout men 's pillows from below their heads : This yellow slave Will knit and break religions , bless the accursed , Make the hoar leprosy adored , place thieves And give them title , knee and approbation With senators on the bench : this is it That makes the wappen 'd widow wed again ; She , whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores Would cast the gorge at , this embalms and spices To the April day again . Come , damned earth , Thou common whore of mankind , that put 'st odds Among the route of nations , I will make thee Do thy right nature . March afar off Ha ! a drum ? Thou 'rt quick , But yet I 'll bury thee : thou 'lt go , strong thief , When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand . Nay , stay thou out for earnest . Keeping some gold Enter ALCIBIADES , with drum and fife , in warlike manner ; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA
ALCIBIADES : What art thou there ? speak .
TIMON : A beast , as thou art . The canker gnaw thy heart , For showing me again the eyes of man !
ALCIBIADES : What is thy name ? Is man so hateful to thee , That art thyself a man ?
TIMON : I am Misanthropos , and hate mankind . For thy part , I do wish thou wert a dog , That I might love thee something .
ALCIBIADES : I know thee well ; But in thy fortunes am unlearn 'd and strange .
TIMON : I know thee too ; and more than that I know thee , I not desire to know . Follow thy drum ; With man 's blood paint the ground , gules , gules : Religious canons , civil laws are cruel ; Then what should war be ? This fell whore of thine Hath in her more destruction than thy sword , For all her cherubim look .
PHRYNIA : Thy lips rot off !
TIMON : I will not kiss thee ; then the rot returns To thine own lips again .
ALCIBIADES : How came the noble Timon to this change ?
TIMON : As the moon does , by wanting light to give : But then renew I could not , like the moon ; There were no suns to borrow of .
ALCIBIADES : Noble Timon , What friendship may I do thee ?
TIMON : None , but to Maintain my opinion .
ALCIBIADES : What is it , Timon ?
TIMON : Promise me friendship , but perform none : if thou wilt not promise , the gods plague thee , for thou art a man ! if thou dost perform , confound thee , for thou art a man !
ALCIBIADES : I have heard in some sort of thy miseries .
TIMON : Thou saw 'st them , when I had prosperity .
ALCIBIADES : I see them now ; then was a blessed time .
TIMON : As thine is now , held with a brace of harlots .
TIMANDRA : Is this the Athenian minion , whom the world Voiced so regardfully ?
TIMON : Art thou Timandra ?
TIMANDRA : Yes .
TIMON : Be a whore still : they love thee not that use thee ; Give them diseases , leaving with thee their lust . Make use of thy salt hours : season the slaves For tubs and baths ; bring down rose-cheeked youth To the tub-fast and the diet .
TIMANDRA : Hang thee , monster !
ALCIBIADES : Pardon him , sweet Timandra ; for his wits Are drown 'd and lost in his calamities . I have but little gold of late , brave Timon , The want whereof doth daily make revolt In my penurious band : I have heard , and grieved , How cursed Athens , mindless of thy worth , Forgetting thy great deeds , when neighbour states , But for thy sword and fortune , trod upon them , --
TIMON : I prithee , beat thy drum , and get thee gone .
ALCIBIADES : I am thy friend , and pity thee , dear Timon .
TIMON : How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble ? I had rather be alone .
ALCIBIADES : Why , fare thee well : Here is some gold for thee .
TIMON : Keep it , I cannot eat it .
ALCIBIADES : When I have laid proud Athens on a heap , --
TIMON : Warr 'st thou ' gainst Athens ?
ALCIBIADES : Ay , Timon , and have cause .
TIMON : The gods confound them all in thy conquest ; And thee after , when thou hast conquer 'd !
ALCIBIADES : Why me , Timon ?
