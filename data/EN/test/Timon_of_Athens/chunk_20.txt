ALCIBIADES : What art thou there ? speak .
TIMON : A beast , as thou art . The canker gnaw thy heart , For showing me again the eyes of man !
ALCIBIADES : What is thy name ? Is man so hateful to thee , That art thyself a man ?
TIMON : I am Misanthropos , and hate mankind . For thy part , I do wish thou wert a dog , That I might love thee something .
ALCIBIADES : I know thee well ; But in thy fortunes am unlearn 'd and strange .
TIMON : I know thee too ; and more than that I know thee , I not desire to know . Follow thy drum ; With man 's blood paint the ground , gules , gules : Religious canons , civil laws are cruel ; Then what should war be ? This fell whore of thine Hath in her more destruction than thy sword , For all her cherubim look .
PHRYNIA : Thy lips rot off !
TIMON : I will not kiss thee ; then the rot returns To thine own lips again .
ALCIBIADES : How came the noble Timon to this change ?
TIMON : As the moon does , by wanting light to give : But then renew I could not , like the moon ; There were no suns to borrow of .
ALCIBIADES : Noble Timon , What friendship may I do thee ?
TIMON : None , but to Maintain my opinion .
ALCIBIADES : What is it , Timon ?
TIMON : Promise me friendship , but perform none : if thou wilt not promise , the gods plague thee , for thou art a man ! if thou dost perform , confound thee , for thou art a man !
ALCIBIADES : I have heard in some sort of thy miseries .
TIMON : Thou saw 'st them , when I had prosperity .
ALCIBIADES : I see them now ; then was a blessed time .
TIMON : As thine is now , held with a brace of harlots .
TIMANDRA : Is this the Athenian minion , whom the world Voiced so regardfully ?
TIMON : Art thou Timandra ?
TIMANDRA : Yes .
TIMON : Be a whore still : they love thee not that use thee ; Give them diseases , leaving with thee their lust . Make use of thy salt hours : season the slaves For tubs and baths ; bring down rose-cheeked youth To the tub-fast and the diet .
TIMANDRA : Hang thee , monster !
ALCIBIADES : Pardon him , sweet Timandra ; for his wits Are drown 'd and lost in his calamities . I have but little gold of late , brave Timon , The want whereof doth daily make revolt In my penurious band : I have heard , and grieved , How cursed Athens , mindless of thy worth , Forgetting thy great deeds , when neighbour states , But for thy sword and fortune , trod upon them , --
TIMON : I prithee , beat thy drum , and get thee gone .
ALCIBIADES : I am thy friend , and pity thee , dear Timon .
TIMON : How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble ? I had rather be alone .
ALCIBIADES : Why , fare thee well : Here is some gold for thee .
TIMON : Keep it , I cannot eat it .
ALCIBIADES : When I have laid proud Athens on a heap , --
TIMON : Warr 'st thou ' gainst Athens ?
ALCIBIADES : Ay , Timon , and have cause .
TIMON : The gods confound them all in thy conquest ; And thee after , when thou hast conquer 'd !
ALCIBIADES : Why me , Timon ?
