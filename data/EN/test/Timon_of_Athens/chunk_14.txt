HORTENSIUS : I 'm weary of this charge , the gods can witness : I know my lord hath spent of Timon 's wealth , And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth . Varro 's
First Servant : Yes , mine 's three thousand crowns : what 's yours ? Lucilius ' Servant Five thousand mine . Varro 's
First Servant : ' Tis much deep : and it should seem by the sun , Your master 's confidence was above mine ; Else , surely , his had equall 'd . Enter FLAMINIUS .
TITUS : One of Lord Timon 's men . Lucilius ' Servant Flaminius ! Sir , a word : pray , is my lord ready to come forth ?
FLAMINIUS : No , indeed , he is not .
TITUS : We attend his lordship ; pray , signify so much .
FLAMINIUS : I need not tell him that ; he knows you are too diligent . Exit Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak , muffled Lucilius ' Servant Ha ! is not that his steward muffled so ? He goes away in a cloud : call him , call him .
TITUS : Do you hear , sir ? Varro 's
Second Servant : By your leave , sir , --
FLAVIUS : What do ye ask of me , my friend ?
TITUS : We wait for certain money here , sir .
FLAVIUS : Ay , If money were as certain as your waiting , ' Twere sure enough . Why then preferr 'd you not your sums and bills , When your false masters eat of my lord 's meat ? Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down the interest into their gluttonous maws . You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up ; Let me pass quietly : Believe ' t , my lord and I have made an end ; I have no more to reckon , he to spend . Lucilius ' Servant Ay , but this answer will not serve .
FLAVIUS : If ' twill not serve , ' tis not so base as you ; For you serve knaves . Exit Varro 's
First Servant : How ! what does his cashiered worship mutter ? Varro 's
Second Servant : No matter what ; he 's poor , and that 's revenge enough . Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in ? such may rail against great buildings . Enter SERVILIUS
TITUS : O , here 's Servilius ; now we shall know some answer .
SERVILIUS : If I might beseech you , gentlemen , to repair some other hour , I should derive much from 't ; for , take 't of my soul , my lord leans wondrously to discontent : his comfortable temper has forsook him ; he 's much out of health , and keeps his chamber . Lucilius ' Servant : Many do keep their chambers are not sick : And , if it be so far beyond his health , Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts , And make a clear way to the gods .
SERVILIUS : Good gods !
TITUS : We cannot take this for answer , sir .
FLAMINIUS : Servilius , help ! My lord ! my lord ! Enter TIMON , in a rage , FLAMINIUS following
TIMON : What , are my doors opposed against my passage ? Have I been ever free , and must my house Be my retentive enemy , my gaol ? The place which I have feasted , does it now , Like all mankind , show me an iron heart ? Lucilius ' Servant Put in now , Titus .
TITUS : My lord , here is my bill . Lucilius ' Servant Here 's mine .
HORTENSIUS : And mine , my lord . Both Varro 's Servants And ours , my lord .
PHILOTUS : All our bills .
TIMON : Knock me down with ' em : cleave me to the girdle . Lucilius ' Servant Alas , my lord , -
TIMON : Cut my heart in sums .
TITUS : Mine , fifty talents .
TIMON : Tell out my blood . Lucilius ' Servant Five thousand crowns , my lord .
TIMON : Five thousand drops pays that . What yours ? --and yours ? Varro 's
First Servant : My lord , -- Varro 's
