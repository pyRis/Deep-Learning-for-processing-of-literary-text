TIMON : I take all and your several visitations So kind to heart , ' tis not enough to give ; Methinks , I could deal kingdoms to my friends , And ne 'er be weary . Alcibiades , Thou art a soldier , therefore seldom rich ; It comes in charity to thee : for all thy living Is ' mongst the dead , and all the lands thou hast Lie in a pitch 'd field .
ALCIBIADES : Ay , defiled land , my lord .
First Lord : We are so virtuously bound--
TIMON : And so Am I to you .
Second Lord : So infinitely endear 'd--
TIMON : All to you . Lights , more lights !
First Lord : The best of happiness , Honour and fortunes , keep with you , Lord Timon !
TIMON : Ready for his friends .
APEMANTUS : What a coil 's here ! Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums ! I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums That are given for ' em . Friendship 's full of dregs : Methinks , false hearts should never have sound legs , Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court 'sies .
TIMON : Now , Apemantus , if thou wert not sullen , I would be good to thee .
APEMANTUS : No , I 'll nothing : for if I should be bribed too , there would be none left to rail upon thee , and then thou wouldst sin the faster . Thou givest so long , Timon , I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly : what need these feasts , pomps and vain-glories ?
TIMON : Nay , an you begin to rail on society once , I am sworn not to give regard to you . Farewell ; and come with better music . Exit
APEMANTUS : So : Thou wilt not hear me now ; thou shalt not then : I 'll lock thy heaven from thee . O , that men 's ears should be To counsel deaf , but not to flattery ! Exit Enter Senator , with papers in his hand
Senator : And late , five thousand : to Varro and to Isidore He owes nine thousand ; besides my former sum , Which makes it five and twenty . Still in motion Of raging waste ? It cannot hold ; it will not . If I want gold , steal but a beggar 's dog , And give it Timon , why , the dog coins gold . If I would sell my horse , and buy twenty more Better than he , why , give my horse to Timon , Ask nothing , give it him , it foals me , straight , And able horses . No porter at his gate , But rather one that smiles and still invites All that pass by . It cannot hold : no reason Can found his state in safety . Caphis , ho ! Caphis , I say ! Enter CAPHIS
CAPHIS : Here , sir ; what is your pleasure ?
Senator : Get on your cloak , and haste you to Lord Timon ; Importune him for my moneys ; be not ceased With slight denial , nor then silenced when-- ' Commend me to your master ' --and the cap Plays in the right hand , thus : but tell him , My uses cry to me , I must serve my turn Out of mine own ; his days and times are past And my reliances on his fracted dates Have smit my credit : I love and honour him , But must not break my back to heal his finger ; Immediate are my needs , and my relief Must not be toss 'd and turn 'd to me in words , But find supply immediate . Get you gone : Put on a most importunate aspect , A visage of demand ; for , I do fear , When every feather sticks in his own wing , Lord Timon will be left a naked gull , Which flashes now a phoenix . Get you gone .
CAPHIS : I go , sir .
Senator : ' I go , sir ! ' --Take the bonds along with you , And have the dates in contempt .
CAPHIS : I will , sir .
Senator : Go . Enter FLAVIUS , with many bills in his hand
