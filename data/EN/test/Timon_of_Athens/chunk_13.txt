SEMPRONIUS : Must he needs trouble me in ' t , --hum ! -- ' bove all others ? He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus ; And now Ventidius is wealthy too , Whom he redeem 'd from prison : all these Owe their estates unto him .
Servant : My lord , They have all been touch 'd and found base metal , for They have au denied him .
SEMPRONIUS : How ! have they denied him ? Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him ? And does he send to me ? Three ? hum ! It shows but little love or judgment in him : Must I be his last refuge ! His friends , like physicians , Thrive , give him over : must I take the cure upon me ? Has much disgraced me in 't ; I 'm angry at him , That might have known my place : I see no sense for 't , But his occasion might have woo 'd me first ; For , in my conscience , I was the first man That e 'er received gift from him : And does he think so backwardly of me now , That I 'll requite its last ? No : So it may prove an argument of laughter To the rest , and ' mongst lords I be thought a fool . I 'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum , Had sent to me first , but for my mind 's sake ; I 'd such a courage to do him good . But now return , And with their faint reply this answer join ; Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin . Exit
Servant : Excellent ! Your lordship 's a goodly villain . The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic ; he crossed himself by ' t : and I cannot think but , in the end , the villainies of man will set him clear . How fairly this lord strives to appear foul ! takes virtuous copies to be wicked , like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire : Of such a nature is his politic love . This was my lord 's best hope ; now all are fled , Save only the gods : now his friends are dead , Doors , that were ne 'er acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employ 'd Now to guard sure their master . And this is all a liberal course allows ; Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house . Exit Enter two Servants of Varro , and the Servant of LUCIUS , meeting TITUS , HORTENSIUS , and other Servants of TIMON 's creditors , waiting his coming out Varro 's
First Servant : Well met ; good morrow , Titus and Hortensius .
TITUS : The like to you kind Varro .
HORTENSIUS : Lucius ! What , do we meet together ? Lucilius ' Servant Ay , and I think One business does command us all ; for mine Is money .
TITUS : So is theirs and ours . Enter PHILOTUS Lucilius ' Servant And Sir Philotus too !
PHILOTUS : Good day at once . Lucilius ' Servant Welcome , good brother . What do you think the hour ?
PHILOTUS : Labouring for nine . Lucilius ' Servant So much ?
PHILOTUS : Is not my lord seen yet ? Lucilius ' Servant Not yet .
PHILOTUS : I wonder on 't ; he was wont to shine at seven . Lucilius ' Servant Ay , but the days are wax 'd shorter with him : You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the sun 's ; but not , like his , recoverable . I fear ' tis deepest winter in Lord Timon 's purse ; That is one may reach deep enough , and yet Find little .
PHILOTUS : I am of your fear for that .
TITUS : I 'll show you how to observe a strange event . Your lord sends now for money .
HORTENSIUS : Most true , he does .
TITUS : And he wears jewels now of Timon 's gift , For which I wait for money .
