Poet : Good day , sir .
Painter : I am glad you 're well .
Poet : I have not seen you long : how goes the world ?
Painter : It wears , sir , as it grows .
Poet : Ay , that 's well known : But what particular rarity ? what strange , Which manifold record not matches ? See , Magic of bounty ! all these spirits thy power Hath conjured to attend . I know the merchant .
Painter : I know them both ; th ' other 's a jeweller .
Merchant : O , ' tis a worthy lord .
Jeweller : Nay , that 's most fix 'd .
Merchant : A most incomparable man , breathed , as it were , To an untirable and continuate goodness : He passes . Jeweller : I have a jewel here--
Merchant : O , pray , let 's see 't : for the Lord Timon , sir ? Jeweller : If he will touch the estimate : but , for that--
Poet : ' When we for recompense have praised the vile , It stains the glory in that happy verse Which aptly sings the good . ' 
Merchant : ' Tis a good form . Looking at the jewel
Jeweller : And rich : here is a water , look ye .
Painter : You are rapt , sir , in some work , some dedication To the great lord .
Poet : A thing slipp 'd idly from me . Our poesy is as a gum , which oozes From whence ' tis nourish 'd : the fire i ' the flint Shows not till it be struck ; our gentle flame Provokes itself and like the current flies Each bound it chafes . What have you there ?
Painter : A picture , sir . When comes your book forth ?
Poet : Upon the heels of my presentment , sir . Let 's see your piece .
Painter : ' Tis a good piece .
Poet : So ' tis : this comes off well and excellent .
Painter : Indifferent .
Poet : Admirable : how this grace Speaks his own standing ! what a mental power This eye shoots forth ! how big imagination Moves in this lip ! to the dumbness of the gesture One might interpret .
Painter : It is a pretty mocking of the life . Here is a touch ; is 't good ?
Poet : I will say of it , It tutors nature : artificial strife Lives in these touches , livelier than life . Enter certain Senators , and pass over
Painter : How this lord is follow 'd !
Poet : The senators of Athens : happy man !
Painter : Look , more !
Poet : You see this confluence , this great flood of visitors . I have , in this rough work , shaped out a man , Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug With amplest entertainment : my free drift Halts not particularly , but moves itself In a wide sea of wax : no levell 'd malice Infects one comma in the course I hold ; But flies an eagle flight , bold and forth on , Leaving no tract behind .
Painter : How shall I understand you ?
Poet : I will unbolt to you . You see how all conditions , how all minds , As well of glib and slippery creatures as Of grave and austere quality , tender down Their services to Lord Timon : his large fortune Upon his good and gracious nature hanging Subdues and properties to his love and tendance All sorts of hearts ; yea , from the glass-faced flatterer To Apemantus , that few things loves better Than to abhor himself : even he drops down The knee before him , and returns in peace Most rich in Timon 's nod .
Painter : I saw them speak together .
