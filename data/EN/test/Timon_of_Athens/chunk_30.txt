Second Senator : Nor are they living Who were the motives that you first went out ; Shame that they wanted cunning , in excess Hath broke their hearts . March , noble lord , Into our city with thy banners spread : By decimation , and a tithed death-- If thy revenges hunger for that food Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth , And by the hazard of the spotted die Let die the spotted .
First Senator : All have not offended ; For those that were , it is not square to take On those that are , revenges : crimes , like lands , Are not inherited . Then , dear countryman , Bring in thy ranks , but leave without thy rage : Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall With those that have offended : like a shepherd , Approach the fold and cull the infected forth , But kill not all together .
Second Senator : What thou wilt , Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile Than hew to 't with thy sword .
First Senator : Set but thy foot Against our rampired gates , and they shall ope ; So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before , To say thou 'lt enter friendly .
Second Senator : Throw thy glove , Or any token of thine honour else , That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress And not as our confusion , all thy powers Shall make their harbour in our town , till we Have seal 'd thy full desire .
ALCIBIADES : Then there 's my glove ; Descend , and open your uncharged ports : Those enemies of Timon 's and mine own Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof Fall and no more : and , to atone your fears With my more noble meaning , not a man Shall pass his quarter , or offend the stream Of regular justice in your city 's bounds , But shall be render 'd to your public laws At heaviest answer .
Both : ' Tis most nobly spoken .
ALCIBIADES : Descend , and keep your words . The Senators descend , and open the gates Enter Soldier
Soldier : My noble general , Timon is dead ; Entomb 'd upon the very hem o ' the sea ; And on his grave-stone this insculpture , which With wax I brought away , whose soft impression Interprets for my poor ignorance .
