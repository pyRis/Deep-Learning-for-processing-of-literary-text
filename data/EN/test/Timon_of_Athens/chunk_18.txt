TIMON : May you a better feast never behold , You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water Is your perfection . This is Timon 's last ; Who , stuck and spangled with your flatteries , Washes it off , and sprinkles in your faces Your reeking villany . Throwing the water in their faces Live loathed and long , Most smiling , smooth , detested parasites , Courteous destroyers , affable wolves , meek bears , You fools of fortune , trencher-friends , time 's flies , Cap and knee slaves , vapours , and minute-jacks ! Of man and beast the infinite malady Crust you quite o 'er ! What , dost thou go ? Soft ! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou ; -- Stay , I will lend thee money , borrow none . Throws the dishes at them , and drives them out What , all in motion ? Henceforth be no feast , Whereat a villain 's not a welcome guest . Burn , house ! sink , Athens ! henceforth hated be Of Timon man and all humanity ! Exit Re-enter the Lords , Senators , & c
First Lord : How now , my lords !
Second Lord : Know you the quality of Lord Timon 's fury ?
Third Lord : Push ! did you see my cap ?
Fourth Lord : I have lost my gown .
First Lord : He 's but a mad lord , and nought but humour sways him . He gave me a jewel th ' other day , and now he has beat it out of my hat : did you see my jewel ?
Third Lord : Did you see my cap ?
Second Lord : Here ' tis .
Fourth Lord : Here lies my gown .
First Lord : Let 's make no stay .
Second Lord : Lord Timon 's mad .
Third Lord : I feel ' t upon my bones .
Fourth Lord : One day he gives us diamonds , next day stones . Enter TIMON
TIMON : Let me look back upon thee . O thou wall , That girdlest in those wolves , dive in the earth , And fence not Athens ! Matrons , turn incontinent ! Obedience fail in children ! slaves and fools , Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench , And minister in their steads ! to general filths Convert o ' the instant , green virginity , Do ' t in your parents ' eyes ! bankrupts , hold fast ; Rather than render back , out with your knives , And cut your trusters ' throats ! bound servants , steal ! Large-handed robbers your grave masters are , And pill by law . Maid , to thy master 's bed ; Thy mistress is o ' the brothel ! Son of sixteen , pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire , With it beat out his brains ! Piety , and fear , Religion to the gods , peace , justice , truth , Domestic awe , night-rest , and neighbourhood , Instruction , manners , mysteries , and trades , Degrees , observances , customs , and laws , Decline to your confounding contraries , And let confusion live ! Plagues , incident to men , Your potent and infectious fevers heap On Athens , ripe for stroke ! Thou cold sciatica , Cripple our senators , that their limbs may halt As lamely as their manners . Lust and liberty Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth , That ' gainst the stream of virtue they may strive , And drown themselves in riot ! Itches , blains , Sow all the Athenian bosoms ; and their crop Be general leprosy ! Breath infect breath , at their society , as their friendship , may merely poison ! Nothing I 'll bear from thee , But nakedness , thou detestable town ! Take thou that too , with multiplying bans ! Timon will to the woods ; where he shall find The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind . The gods confound--hear me , you good gods all-- The Athenians both within and out that wall ! And grant , as Timon grows , his hate may grow To the whole race of mankind , high and low ! Amen . Exit Enter FLAVIUS , with two or three Servants
First Servant : Hear you , master steward , where 's our master ? Are we undone ? cast off ? nothing remaining ?
FLAVIUS : Alack , my fellows , what should I say to you ? Let me be recorded by the righteous gods , I am as poor as you .
First Servant : Such a house broke ! So noble a master fall 'n ! All gone ! and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm , And go along with him !
Second Servant : As we do turn our backs From our companion thrown into his grave , So his familiars to his buried fortunes Slink all away , leave their false vows with him , Like empty purses pick 'd ; and his poor self , A dedicated beggar to the air , With his disease of all-shunn 'd poverty , Walks , like contempt , alone . More of our fellows . Enter other Servants
FLAVIUS : All broken implements of a ruin 'd house .
