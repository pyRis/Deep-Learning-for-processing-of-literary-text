Painter : We are hither come to offer you our service .
TIMON : Most honest men ! Why , how shall I requite you ? Can you eat roots , and drink cold water ? no .
Both : What we can do , we 'll do , to do you service .
TIMON : Ye 're honest men : ye 've heard that I have gold ; I am sure you have : speak truth ; ye 're honest men .
Painter : So it is said , my noble lord ; but therefore Came not my friend nor I.
TIMON : Good honest men ! Thou draw 'st a counterfeit Best in all Athens : thou 'rt , indeed , the best ; Thou counterfeit 'st most lively .
Painter : So , so , my lord .
TIMON : E 'en so , sir , as I say . And , for thy fiction , Why , thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth That thou art even natural in thine art . But , for all this , my honest-natured friends , I must needs say you have a little fault : Marry , ' tis not monstrous in you , neither wish I You take much pains to mend .
Both : Beseech your honour To make it known to us .
TIMON : You 'll take it ill .
Both : Most thankfully , my lord .
TIMON : Will you , indeed ?
Both : Doubt it not , worthy lord .
TIMON : There 's never a one of you but trusts a knave , That mightily deceives you .
Both : Do we , my lord ?
TIMON : Ay , and you hear him cog , see him dissemble , Know his gross patchery , love him , feed him , Keep in your bosom : yet remain assured That he 's a made-up villain .
Painter : I know none such , my lord .
Poet : Nor I.
TIMON : Look you , I love you well ; I 'll give you gold , Rid me these villains from your companies : Hang them or stab them , drown them in a draught , Confound them by some course , and come to me , I 'll give you gold enough .
Both : Name them , my lord , let 's know them .
TIMON : You that way and you this , but two in company ; Each man apart , all single and alone , Yet an arch-villain keeps him company . If where thou art two villains shall not be , Come not near him . If thou wouldst not reside But where one villain is , then him abandon . Hence , pack ! there 's gold ; you came for gold , ye slaves : To Painter You have work 'd for me ; there 's payment for you : hence ! To Poet You are an alchemist ; make gold of that . Out , rascal dogs ! Beats them out , and then retires to his cave Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators
FLAVIUS : It is in vain that you would speak with Timon ; For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself which looks like man Is friendly with him .
First Senator : Bring us to his cave : It is our part and promise to the Athenians To speak with Timon .
Second Senator : At all times alike Men are not still the same : ' twas time and griefs That framed him thus : time , with his fairer hand , Offering the fortunes of his former days , The former man may make him . Bring us to him , And chance it as it may .
FLAVIUS : Here is his cave . Peace and content be here ! Lord Timon ! Timon ! Look out , and speak to friends : the Athenians , By two of their most reverend senate , greet thee : Speak to them , noble Timon . TIMON comes from his cave
TIMON : Thou sun , that comfort 'st , burn ! Speak , and be hang 'd : For each true word , a blister ! and each false Be as cauterizing to the root o ' the tongue , Consuming it with speaking !
First Senator : Worthy Timon , --
TIMON : Of none but such as you , and you of Timon .
