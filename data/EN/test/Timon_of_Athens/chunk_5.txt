TIMON : O , no doubt , my good friends , but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you : how had you been my friends else ? why have you that charitable title from thousands , did not you chiefly belong to my heart ? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf ; and thus far I confirm you . O you gods , think I , what need we have any friends , if we should ne 'er have need of ' em ? they were the most needless creatures living , should we ne 'er have use for ' em , and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves . Why , I have often wished myself poorer , that I might come nearer to you . We are born to do benefits : and what better or properer can we can our own than the riches of our friends ? O , what a precious comfort ' tis , to have so many , like brothers , commanding one another 's fortunes ! O joy , e 'en made away ere ' t can be born ! Mine eyes cannot hold out water , methinks : to forget their faults , I drink to you .
APEMANTUS : Thou weepest to make them drink , Timon .
Second Lord : Joy had the like conception in our eyes And at that instant like a babe sprung up .
APEMANTUS : Ho , ho ! I laugh to think that babe a bastard .
Third Lord : I promise you , my lord , you moved me much .
APEMANTUS : Much ! Tucket , within
TIMON : What means that trump ? Enter a Servant How now ?
Servant : Please you , my lord , there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance .
TIMON : Ladies ! what are their wills ?
Servant : There comes with them a forerunner , my lord , which bears that office , to signify their pleasures .
TIMON : I pray , let them be admitted . Enter Cupid
Cupid : Hail to thee , worthy Timon , and to all That of his bounties taste ! The five best senses Acknowledge thee their patron ; and come freely To gratulate thy plenteous bosom : th ' ear , Taste , touch and smell , pleased from thy tale rise ; They only now come but to feast thine eyes .
TIMON : They 're welcome all ; let ' em have kind admittance : Music , make their welcome ! Exit Cupid
First Lord : You see , my lord , how ample you 're beloved . Music . Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies as Amazons , with lutes in their hands , dancing and playing
APEMANTUS : Hoy-day , what a sweep of vanity comes this way ! They dance ! they are mad women . Like madness is the glory of this life . As this pomp shows to a little oil and root . We make ourselves fools , to disport ourselves ; And spend our flatteries , to drink those men Upon whose age we void it up again , With poisonous spite and envy . Who lives that 's not depraved or depraves ? Who dies , that bears not one spurn to their graves Of their friends ' gift ? I should fear those that dance before me now Would one day stamp upon me : ' t has been done ; Men shut their doors against a setting sun . The Lords rise from table , with much adoring of TIMON ; and to show their loves , each singles out an Amazon , and all dance , men with women , a lofty strain or two to the hautboys , and cease
TIMON : You have done our pleasures much grace , fair ladies , Set a fair fashion on our entertainment , Which was not half so beautiful and kind ; You have added worth unto ' t and lustre , And entertain 'd me with mine own device ; I am to thank you for ' t .
First Lady : My lord , you take us even at the best .
APEMANTUS : ' Faith , for the worst is filthy ; and would not hold taking , I doubt me .
