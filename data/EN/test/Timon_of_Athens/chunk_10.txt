TIMON : Prithee , no more .
FLAVIUS : Heavens , have I said , the bounty of this lord ! How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants This night englutted ! Who is not Timon 's ? What heart , head , sword , force , means , but is Lord Timon 's ? Great Timon , noble , worthy , royal Timon ! Ah , when the means are gone that buy this praise , The breath is gone whereof this praise is made : Feast-won , fast-lost ; one cloud of winter showers , These flies are couch 'd .
TIMON : Come , sermon me no further : No villanous bounty yet hath pass 'd my heart ; Unwisely , not ignobly , have I given . Why dost thou weep ? Canst thou the conscience lack , To think I shall lack friends ? Secure thy heart ; If I would broach the vessels of my love , And try the argument of hearts by borrowing , Men and men 's fortunes could I frankly use As I can bid thee speak .
FLAVIUS : Assurance bless your thoughts !
TIMON : And , in some sort , these wants of mine are crown 'd , That I account them blessings ; for by these Shall I try friends : you shall perceive how you Mistake my fortunes ; I am wealthy in my friends . Within there ! Flaminius ! Servilius ! Enter FLAMINIUS , SERVILIUS , and other Servants
Servants : My lord ? my lord ?
TIMON : I will dispatch you severally ; you to Lord Lucius ; to Lord Lucullus you : I hunted with his honour to-day : you , to Sempronius : commend me to their loves , and , I am proud , say , that my occasions have found time to use ' em toward a supply of money : let the request be fifty talents .
FLAMINIUS : As you have said , my lord .
FLAVIUS : Lord Lucius and Lucullus ? hum !
TIMON : Go you , sir , to the senators-- Of whom , even to the state 's best health , I have Deserved this hearing--bid ' em send o ' the instant A thousand talents to me .
FLAVIUS : I have been bold-- For that I knew it the most general way-- To them to use your signet and your name ; But they do shake their heads , and I am here No richer in return .
TIMON : Is 't true ? can 't be ?
FLAVIUS : They answer , in a joint and corporate voice , That now they are at fall , want treasure , cannot Do what they would ; are sorry--you are honourable , -- But yet they could have wish 'd--they know not-- Something hath been amiss--a noble nature May catch a wrench--would all were well-- ' tis pity ; -- And so , intending other serious matters , After distasteful looks and these hard fractions , With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods They froze me into silence .
TIMON : You gods , reward them ! Prithee , man , look cheerly . These old fellows Have their ingratitude in them hereditary : Their blood is caked , ' tis cold , it seldom flows ; ' Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind ; And nature , as it grows again toward earth , Is fashion 'd for the journey , dull and heavy . To a Servant Go to Ventidius . To FLAVIUS Prithee , be not sad , Thou art true and honest ; ingeniously I speak . No blame belongs to thee . To Servant Ventidius lately Buried his father ; by whose death he 's stepp 'd Into a great estate : when he was poor , Imprison 'd and in scarcity of friends , I clear 'd him with five talents : greet him from me ; Bid him suppose some good necessity Touches his friend , which craves to be remember 'd With those five talents . Exit Servant To FLAVIUS That had , give 't these fellows To whom ' tis instant due . Ne 'er speak , or think , That Timon 's fortunes ' mong his friends can sink .
