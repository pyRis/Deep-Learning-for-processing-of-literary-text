APEMANTUS : Would thou wouldst burst !
TIMON : Away , Thou tedious rogue ! I am sorry I shall lose A stone by thee . Throws a stone at him
APEMANTUS : Beast !
TIMON : Slave !
APEMANTUS : Toad !
TIMON : Rogue , rogue , rogue ! I am sick of this false world , and will love nought But even the mere necessities upon ' t . Then , Timon , presently prepare thy grave ; Lie where the light foam the sea may beat Thy grave-stone daily : make thine epitaph , That death in me at others ' lives may laugh . To the gold O thou sweet king-killer , and dear divorce ' Twixt natural son and sire ! thou bright defiler Of Hymen 's purest bed ! thou valiant Mars ! Thou ever young , fresh , loved and delicate wooer , Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow That lies on Dian 's lap ! thou visible god , That solder 'st close impossibilities , And makest them kiss ! that speak 'st with every tongue , To every purpose ! O thou touch of hearts ! Think , thy slave man rebels , and by thy virtue Set them into confounding odds , that beasts May have the world in empire !
APEMANTUS : Would ' twere so ! But not till I am dead . I 'll say thou 'st gold : Thou wilt be throng 'd to shortly .
TIMON : Throng 'd to !
APEMANTUS : Ay .
TIMON : Thy back , I prithee .
APEMANTUS : Live , and love thy misery .
TIMON : Long live so , and so die . Exit APEMANTUS I am quit . Moe things like men ! Eat , Timon , and abhor them . Enter Banditti
First Bandit : Where should he have this gold ? It is some poor fragment , some slender sort of his remainder : the mere want of gold , and the falling-from of his friends , drove him into this melancholy .
Second Bandit : It is noised he hath a mass of treasure .
Third Bandit : Let us make the assay upon him : if he care not for 't , he will supply us easily ; if he covetously reserve it , how shall 's get it ?
Second Bandit : True ; for he bears it not about him , ' tis hid .
First Bandit : Is not this he ?
Banditti : Where ?
Second Bandit : ' Tis his description .
Third Bandit : He ; I know him .
Banditti : Save thee , Timon .
TIMON : Now , thieves ?
Banditti : Soldiers , not thieves .
TIMON : Both too ; and women 's sons .
Banditti : We are not thieves , but men that much do want .
TIMON : Your greatest want is , you want much of meat . Why should you want ? Behold , the earth hath roots ; Within this mile break forth a hundred springs ; The oaks bear mast , the briers scarlet hips ; The bounteous housewife , nature , on each bush Lays her full mess before you . Want ! why want ?
First Bandit : We cannot live on grass , on berries , water , As beasts and birds and fishes .
