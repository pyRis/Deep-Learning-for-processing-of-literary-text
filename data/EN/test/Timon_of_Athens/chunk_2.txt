Old Athenian : Three talents on the present ; in future , all .
TIMON : This gentleman of mine hath served me long : To build his fortune I will strain a little , For ' tis a bond in men . Give him thy daughter : What you bestow , in him I 'll counterpoise , And make him weigh with her .
Old Athenian : Most noble lord , Pawn me to this your honour , she is his .
TIMON : My hand to thee ; mine honour on my promise .
LUCILIUS : Humbly I thank your lordship : never may The state or fortune fall into my keeping , Which is not owed to you !
Poet : Vouchsafe my labour , and long live your lordship !
TIMON : I thank you ; you shall hear from me anon : Go not away . What have you there , my friend ?
Painter : A piece of painting , which I do beseech Your lordship to accept .
TIMON : Painting is welcome . The painting is almost the natural man ; or since dishonour traffics with man 's nature , He is but outside : these pencill 'd figures are Even such as they give out . I like your work ; And you shall find I like it : wait attendance Till you hear further from me .
Painter : The gods preserve ye !
TIMON : Well fare you , gentleman : give me your hand ; We must needs dine together . Sir , your jewel Hath suffer 'd under praise .
Jeweller : What , my lord ! dispraise ?
TIMON : A more satiety of commendations . If I should pay you for 't as ' tis extoll 'd , It would unclew me quite .
Jeweller : My lord , ' tis rated As those which sell would give : but you well know , Things of like value differing in the owners Are prized by their masters : believe 't , dear lord , You mend the jewel by the wearing it .
TIMON : Well mock 'd .
Merchant : No , my good lord ; he speaks the common tongue , Which all men speak with him .
TIMON : Look , who comes here : will you be chid ? Enter APEMANTUS Jeweller : We 'll bear , with your lordship .
Merchant : He 'll spare none .
TIMON : Good morrow to thee , gentle Apemantus !
APEMANTUS : Till I be gentle , stay thou for thy good morrow ; When thou art Timon 's dog , and these knaves honest .
TIMON : Why dost thou call them knaves ? thou know 'st them not .
APEMANTUS : Are they not Athenians ?
TIMON : Yes .
APEMANTUS : Then I repent not . Jeweller : You know me , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : Thou know 'st I do : I call 'd thee by thy name .
TIMON : Thou art proud , Apemantus .
APEMANTUS : Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon .
TIMON : Whither art going ?
APEMANTUS : To knock out an honest Athenian 's brains .
TIMON : That 's a deed thou 'lt die for .
APEMANTUS : Right , if doing nothing be death by the law .
TIMON : How likest thou this picture , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : The best , for the innocence .
TIMON : Wrought he not well that painted it ?
APEMANTUS : He wrought better that made the painter ; and yet he 's but a filthy piece of work .
Painter : You 're a dog .
APEMANTUS : Thy mother 's of my generation : what 's she , if I be a dog ?
TIMON : Wilt dine with me , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : No ; I eat not lords .
TIMON : An thou shouldst , thou ' ldst anger ladies .
APEMANTUS : O , they eat lords ; so they come by great bellies .
TIMON : That 's a lascivious apprehension .
APEMANTUS : So thou apprehendest it : take it for thy labour .
TIMON : How dost thou like this jewel , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : Not so well as plain-dealing , which will not cost a man a doit .
TIMON : What dost thou think ' tis worth ?
APEMANTUS : Not worth my thinking . How now , poet !
Poet : How now , philosopher !
APEMANTUS : Thou liest .
