FLAVIUS : Trouble him no further ; thus you still shall find him .
TIMON : Come not to me again : but say to Athens , Timon hath made his everlasting mansion Upon the beached verge of the salt flood ; Who once a day with his embossed froth The turbulent surge shall cover : thither come , And let my grave-stone be your oracle . Lips , let sour words go by and language end : What is amiss plague and infection mend ! Graves only be men 's works and death their gain ! Sun , hide thy beams ! Timon hath done his reign . Retires to his cave
First Senator : His discontents are unremoveably Coupled to nature .
Second Senator : Our hope in him is dead : let us return , And strain what other means is left unto us In our dear peril .
First Senator : It requires swift foot . Enter two Senators and a Messenger
First Senator : Thou hast painfully discover 'd : are his files As full as thy report ?
Messenger : have spoke the least : Besides , his expedition promises Present approach .
Second Senator : We stand much hazard , if they bring not Timon .
Messenger : I met a courier , one mine ancient friend ; Whom , though in general part we were opposed , Yet our old love made a particular force , And made us speak like friends : this man was riding From Alcibiades to Timon 's cave , With letters of entreaty , which imported His fellowship i ' the cause against your city , In part for his sake moved .
First Senator : Here come our brothers . Enter the Senators from TIMON
Third Senator : No talk of Timon , nothing of him expect . The enemies ' drum is heard , and fearful scouring Doth choke the air with dust : in , and prepare : Ours is the fall , I fear ; our foes the snare . Enter a Soldier , seeking TIMON
Soldier : By all description this should be the place . Who 's here ? speak , ho ! No answer ! What is this ? Timon is dead , who hath outstretch 'd his span : Some beast rear 'd this ; there does not live a man . Dead , sure ; and this his grave . What 's on this tomb I cannot read ; the character I 'll take with wax : Our captain hath in every figure skill , An aged interpreter , though young in days : Before proud Athens he 's set down by this , Whose fall the mark of his ambition is . Exit Trumpets sound . Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers
ALCIBIADES : Sound to this coward and lascivious town Our terrible approach . A parley sounded Enter Senators on the walls Till now you have gone on and fill 'd the time With all licentious measure , making your wills The scope of justice ; till now myself and such As slept within the shadow of your power Hav e wander 'd with our traversed arms and breathed Our sufferance vainly : now the time is flush , When crouching marrow in the bearer strong Cries of itself ' No more : ' now breathless wrong Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease , And pursy insolence shall break his wind With fear and horrid flight .
First Senator : Noble and young , When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit , Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear , We sent to thee , to give thy rages balm , To wipe out our ingratitude with loves Above their quantity .
Second Senator : So did we woo Transformed Timon to our city 's love By humble message and by promised means : We were not all unkind , nor all deserve The common stroke of war .
First Senator : These walls of ours Were not erected by their hands from whom You have received your griefs ; nor are they such That these great towers , trophies and schools should fall For private faults in them .
