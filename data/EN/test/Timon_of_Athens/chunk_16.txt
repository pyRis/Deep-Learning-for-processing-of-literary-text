Second Senator : You breathe in vain .
ALCIBIADES : In vain ! his service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life .
First Senator : What 's that ?
ALCIBIADES : I say , my lords , he has done fair service , And slain in fight many of your enemies : How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict , and made plenteous wounds !
Second Senator : He has made too much plenty with ' em ; He 's a sworn rioter : he has a sin that often Drowns him , and takes his valour prisoner : If there were no foes , that were enough To overcome him : in that beastly fury He has been known to commit outrages , And cherish factions : ' tis inferr 'd to us , His days are foul and his drink dangerous .
First Senator : He dies .
ALCIBIADES : Hard fate ! he might have died in war . My lords , if not for any parts in him-- Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none--yet , more to move you , Take my deserts to his , and join ' em both : And , for I know your reverend ages love Security , I 'll pawn my victories , all My honours to you , upon his good returns . If by this crime he owes the law his life , Why , let the war receive ' t in valiant gore For law is strict , and war is nothing more .
First Senator : We are for law : he dies ; urge it no more , On height of our displeasure : friend or brother , He forfeits his own blood that spills another .
ALCIBIADES : Must it be so ? it must not be . My lords , I do beseech you , know me .
Second Senator : How !
ALCIBIADES : Call me to your remembrances .
Third Senator : What !
ALCIBIADES : I cannot think but your age has forgot me ; It could not else be , I should prove so base , To sue , and be denied such common grace : My wounds ache at you .
First Senator : Do you dare our anger ? ' Tis in few words , but spacious in effect ; We banish thee for ever .
ALCIBIADES : Banish me ! Banish your dotage ; banish usury , That makes the senate ugly .
First Senator : If , after two days ' shine , Athens contain thee , Attend our weightier judgment . And , not to swell our spirit , He shall be executed presently .
ALCIBIADES : Now the gods keep you old enough ; that you may live Only in bone , that none may look on you ! I 'm worse than mad : I have kept back their foes , While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest , I myself Rich only in large hurts . All those for this ? Is this the balsam that the usuring senate Pours into captains ' wounds ? Banishment ! It comes not ill ; I hate not to be banish 'd ; It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury , That I may strike at Athens . I 'll cheer up My discontented troops , and lay for hearts . ' Tis honour with most lands to be at odds ; Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods . Exit Music . Tables set out : Servants attending . Enter divers Lords , Senators and others , at several doors
First Lord : The good time of day to you , sir .
Second Lord : I also wish it to you . I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day .
First Lord : Upon that were my thoughts tiring , when we encountered : I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends .
Second Lord : It should not be , by the persuasion of his new feasting .
First Lord : I should think so : he hath sent me an earnest inviting , which many my near occasions did urge me to put off ; but he hath conjured me beyond them , and I must needs appear .
