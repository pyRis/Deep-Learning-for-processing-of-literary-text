FLAVIUS : O , let me stay , And comfort you , my master .
TIMON : If thou hatest curses , Stay not ; fly , whilst thou art blest and free : Ne 'er see thou man , and let me ne 'er see thee . Exit FLAVIUS . TIMON retires to his cave Enter Poet and Painter ; TIMON watching them from his cave
Painter : As I took note of the place , it cannot be far where he abides .
Poet : What 's to be thought of him ? does the rumour hold for true , that he 's so full of gold ?
Painter : Certain : Alcibiades reports it ; Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him : he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity : ' tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum .
Poet : Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends .
Painter : Nothing else : you shall see him a palm in Athens again , and flourish with the highest . Therefore ' tis not amiss we tender our loves to him , in this supposed distress of his : it will show honestly in us ; and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for , if it be a just true report that goes of his having .
Poet : What have you now to present unto him ?
Painter : Nothing at this time but my visitation : only I will promise him an excellent piece .
Poet : I must serve him so too , tell him of an intent that 's coming toward him .
Painter : Good as the best . Promising is the very air o ' the time : it opens the eyes of expectation : performance is ever the duller for his act ; and , but in the plainer and simpler kind of people , the deed of saying is quite out of use . To promise is most courtly and fashionable : performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it . TIMON comes from his cave , behind
TIMON : Excellent workman ! thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself .
Poet : I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him : it must be a personating of himself ; a satire against the softness of prosperity , with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency .
TIMON : Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work ? wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men ? Do so , I have gold for thee .
Poet : Nay , let 's seek him : Then do we sin against our own estate , When we may profit meet , and come too late .
Painter : True ; When the day serves , before black-corner 'd night , Find what thou want 'st by free and offer 'd light . Come .
TIMON : I 'll meet you at the turn . What a god 's gold , That he is worshipp 'd in a baser temple Than where swine feed ! ' Tis thou that rigg 'st the bark and plough 'st the foam , Settlest admired reverence in a slave : To thee be worship ! and thy saints for aye Be crown 'd with plagues that thee alone obey ! Fit I meet them . Coming forward
Poet : Hail , worthy Timon !
Painter : Our late noble master !
TIMON : Have I once lived to see two honest men ?
Poet : Sir , Having often of your open bounty tasted , Hearing you were retired , your friends fall 'n off , Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits ! -- Not all the whips of heaven are large enough : What ! to you , Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence To their whole being ! I am rapt and cannot cover The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude With any size of words .
TIMON : Let it go naked , men may see 't the better : You that are honest , by being what you are , Make them best seen and known .
Painter : He and myself Have travail 'd in the great shower of your gifts , And sweetly felt it .
