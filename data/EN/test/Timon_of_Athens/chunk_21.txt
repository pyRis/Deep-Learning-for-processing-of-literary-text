TIMON : That , by killing of villains , Thou wast born to conquer my country . Put up thy gold : go on , --here 's gold , --go on ; Be as a planetary plague , when Jove Will o 'er some high-viced city hang his poison In the sick air : let not thy sword skip one : Pity not honour 'd age for his white beard ; He is an usurer : strike me the counterfeit matron ; It is her habit only that is honest , Herself 's a bawd : let not the virgin 's cheek Make soft thy trenchant sword ; for those milk-paps , That through the window-bars bore at men 's eyes , Are not within the leaf of pity writ , But set them down horrible traitors : spare not the babe , Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy ; Think it a bastard , whom the oracle Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut , And mince it sans remorse : swear against objects ; Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes ; Whose proof , nor yells of mothers , maids , nor babes , Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding , Shall pierce a jot . There 's gold to pay soldiers : Make large confusion ; and , thy fury spent , Confounded be thyself ! Speak not , be gone .
ALCIBIADES : Hast thou gold yet ? I 'll take the gold thou givest me , Not all thy counsel .
TIMON : Dost thou , or dost thou not , heaven 's curse upon thee !
PHRYNIA TIMANDRA : Give us some gold , good Timon : hast thou more ?
TIMON : Enough to make a whore forswear her trade , And to make whores , a bawd . Hold up , you sluts , Your aprons mountant : you are not oathable , Although , I know , you ' ll swear , terribly swear Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues The immortal gods that hear you , --spare your oaths , I 'll trust to your conditions : be whores still ; And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you , Be strong in whore , allure him , burn him up ; Let your close fire predominate his smoke , And be no turncoats : yet may your pains , six months , Be quite contrary : and thatch your poor thin roofs With burthens of the dead ; --some that were hang 'd , No matter : --wear them , betray with them : whore still ; Paint till a horse may mire upon your face , A pox of wrinkles !
PHRYNIA TIMANDRA : Well , more gold : what then ? Believe 't , that we 'll do any thing for gold .
TIMON : Consumptions sow In hollow bones of man ; strike their sharp shins , And mar men 's spurring . Crack the lawyer 's voice , That he may never more false title plead , Nor sound his quillets shrilly : hoar the flamen , That scolds against the quality of flesh , And not believes himself : down with the nose , Down with it flat ; take the bridge quite away Of him that , his particular to foresee , Smells from the general weal : make curl 'd-pate ruffians bald ; And let the unscarr 'd braggarts of the war Derive some pain from you : plague all ; That your activity may defeat and quell The source of all erection . There 's more gold : Do you damn others , and let this damn you , And ditches grave you all !
PHRYNIA TIMANDRA : More counsel with more money , bounteous Timon .
TIMON : More whore , more mischief first ; I have given you earnest .
ALCIBIADES : Strike up the drum towards Athens ! Farewell , Timon : If I thrive well , I 'll visit thee again .
TIMON : If I hope well , I 'll never see thee more .
ALCIBIADES : I never did thee harm .
TIMON : Yes , thou spokest well of me .
ALCIBIADES : Call 'st thou that harm ?
TIMON : Men daily find it . Get thee away , and take Thy beagles with thee .
ALCIBIADES : We but offend him . Strike !
TIMON : That nature , being sick of man 's unkindness , Should yet be hungry ! Common mother , thou , Digging Whose womb unmeasurable , and infinite breast , Teems , and feeds all ; whose self-same mettle , Whereof thy proud child , arrogant man , is puff 'd , Engenders the black toad and adder blue , The gilded newt and eyeless venom 'd worm , With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven Whereon Hyperion 's quickening fire doth shine ; Yield him , who all thy human sons doth hate , From forth thy plenteous bosom , one poor root ! Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb , Let it no more bring out ingrateful man ! Go great with tigers , dragons , wolves , and bears ; Teem with new monsters , whom thy upward face Hath to the marbled mansion all above Never presented ! --O , a root , --dear thanks ! -- Dry up thy marrows , vines , and plough-torn leas ; Whereof ungrateful man , with liquorish draughts And morsels unctuous , greases his pure mind , That from it all consideration slips ! Enter APEMANTUS More man ? plague , plague !
APEMANTUS : I was directed hither : men report Thou dost affect my manners , and dost use them .
TIMON : ' Tis , then , because thou dost not keep a dog , Whom I would imitate : consumption catch thee !
