TIMON : Were I like thee , I 'ld throw away myself .
APEMANTUS : Thou hast cast away thyself , being like thyself ; A madman so long , now a fool . What , think 'st That the bleak air , thy boisterous chamberlain , Will put thy shirt on warm ? will these moss 'd trees , That have outlived the eagle , page thy heels , And skip where thou point 'st out ? will the cold brook , Candied with ice , caudle thy morning taste , To cure thy o 'er-night 's surfeit ? Call the creatures Whose naked natures live in an the spite Of wreakful heaven , whose bare unhoused trunks , To the conflicting elements exposed , Answer mere nature ; bid them flatter thee ; O , thou shalt find--
TIMON : A fool of thee : depart .
APEMANTUS : I love thee better now than e 'er I did .
TIMON : I hate thee worse .
APEMANTUS : Why ?
TIMON : Thou flatter 'st misery .
APEMANTUS : I flatter not ; but say thou art a caitiff .
TIMON : Why dost thou seek me out ?
APEMANTUS : To vex thee .
TIMON : Always a villain 's office or a fool 's . Dost please thyself in 't ?
APEMANTUS : Ay .
TIMON : What ! a knave too ?
APEMANTUS : If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on To castigate thy pride , ' twere well : but thou Dost it enforcedly ; thou 'ldst courtier be again , Wert thou not beggar . Willing misery Outlives encertain pomp , is crown 'd before : The one is filling still , never complete ; The other , at high wish : best state , contentless , Hath a distracted and most wretched being , Worse than the worst , content . Thou shouldst desire to die , being miserable .
TIMON : Not by his breath that is more miserable . Thou art a slave , whom Fortune 's tender arm With favour never clasp 'd ; but bred a dog . Hadst thou , like us from our first swath , proceeded The sweet degrees that this brief world affords To such as may the passive drugs of it Freely command , thou wouldst have plunged thyself In general riot ; melted down thy youth In different beds of lust ; and never learn 'd The icy precepts of respect , but follow 'd The sugar 'd game before thee . But myself , Who had the world as my confectionary , The mouths , the tongues , the eyes and hearts of men At duty , more than I could frame employment , That numberless upon me stuck as leaves Do on the oak , hive with one winter 's brush Fell from their boughs and left me open , bare For every storm that blows : I , to bear this , That never knew but better , is some burden : Thy nature did commence in sufferance , time Hath made thee hard in 't . Why shouldst thou hate men ? They never flatter 'd thee : what hast thou given ? If thou wilt curse , thy father , that poor rag , Must be thy subject , who in spite put stuff To some she beggar and compounded thee Poor rogue hereditary . Hence , be gone ! If thou hadst not been born the worst of men , Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer .
APEMANTUS : Art thou proud yet ?
TIMON : Ay , that I am not thee .
APEMANTUS : I , that I was No prodigal .
TIMON : I , that I am one now : Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee , I 'ld give thee leave to hang it . Get thee gone . That the whole life of Athens were in this ! Thus would I eat it . Eating a root
APEMANTUS : Here ; I will mend thy feast . Offering him a root
TIMON : First mend my company , take away thyself .
APEMANTUS : So I shall mend mine own , by the lack of thine .
TIMON : ' Tis not well mended so , it is but botch 'd ; if not , I would it were .
APEMANTUS : What wouldst thou have to Athens ?
