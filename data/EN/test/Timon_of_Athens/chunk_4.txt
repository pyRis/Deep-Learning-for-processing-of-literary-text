VENTIDIUS : Most honour 'd Timon , It hath pleased the gods to remember my father 's age , And call him to long peace . He is gone happy , and has left me rich : Then , as in grateful virtue I am bound To your free heart , I do return those talents , Doubled with thanks and service , from whose help I derived liberty .
TIMON : O , by no means , Honest Ventidius ; you mistake my love : I gave it freely ever ; and there 's none Can truly say he gives , if he receives : If our betters play at that game , we must not dare To imitate them ; faults that are rich are fair .
VENTIDIUS : A noble spirit !
TIMON : Nay , my lords , They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON Ceremony was but devised at first To set a gloss on faint deeds , hollow welcomes , Recanting goodness , sorry ere ' tis shown ; But where there is true friendship , there needs none . Pray , sit ; more welcome are ye to my fortunes Than my fortunes to me . They sit
First Lord : My lord , we always have confess 'd it .
APEMANTUS : Ho , ho , confess 'd it ! hang 'd it , have you not ?
TIMON : O , Apemantus , you are welcome .
APEMANTUS : No ; You shall not make me welcome : I come to have thee thrust me out of doors .
TIMON : Fie , thou 'rt a churl ; ye 've got a humour there Does not become a man : ' tis much to blame . They say , my lords , ' ira furor brevis est ; ' but yond man is ever angry . Go , let him have a table by himself , for he does neither affect company , nor is he fit for 't , indeed .
APEMANTUS : Let me stay at thine apperil , Timon : I come to observe ; I give thee warning on 't .
TIMON : I take no heed of thee ; thou 'rt an Athenian , therefore welcome : I myself would have no power ; prithee , let my meat make thee silent .
APEMANTUS : I scorn thy meat ; ' twould choke me , for I should ne 'er flatter thee . O you gods , what a number of men eat Timon , and he sees ' em not ! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man 's blood ; and all the madness is , he cheers them up too . I wonder men dare trust themselves with men : Methinks they should invite them without knives ; Good for their meat , and safer for their lives . There 's much example for 't ; the fellow that sits next him now , parts bread with him , pledges the breath of him in a divided draught , is the readiest man to kill him : ' t has been proved . If I were a huge man , I should fear to drink at meals ; Lest they should spy my windpipe 's dangerous notes : Great men should drink with harness on their throats .
TIMON : My lord , in heart ; and let the health go round .
Second Lord : Let it flow this way , my good lord .
APEMANTUS : Flow this way ! A brave fellow ! he keeps his tides well . Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill , Timon . Here 's that which is too weak to be a sinner , honest water , which ne 'er left man i ' the mire : This and my food are equals ; there 's no odds : Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods . Apemantus ' grace . Immortal gods , I crave no pelf ; I pray for no man but myself : Grant I may never prove so fond , To trust man on his oath or bond ; Or a harlot , for her weeping ; Or a dog , that seems a-sleeping : Or a keeper with my freedom ; Or my friends , if I should need ' em . Amen . So fall to 't : Rich men sin , and I eat root . Eats and drinks Much good dich thy good heart , Apemantus !
TIMON : Captain Alcibiades , your heart 's in the field now .
ALCIBIADES : My heart is ever at your service , my lord .
TIMON : You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends .
