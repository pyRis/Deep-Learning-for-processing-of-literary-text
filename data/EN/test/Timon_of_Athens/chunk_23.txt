TIMON : Thee thither in a whirlwind . If thou wilt , Tell them there I have gold ; look , so I have .
APEMANTUS : Here is no use for gold .
TIMON : The best and truest ; For here it sleeps , and does no hired harm .
APEMANTUS : Where liest o ' nights , Timon ?
TIMON : Under that 's above me . Where feed 'st thou o ' days , Apemantus ?
APEMANTUS : Where my stomach finds meat ; or , rather , where I eat it .
TIMON : Would poison were obedient and knew my mind !
APEMANTUS : Where wouldst thou send it ?
TIMON : To sauce thy dishes .
APEMANTUS : The middle of humanity thou never knewest , but the extremity of both ends : when thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume , they mocked thee for too much curiosity ; in thy rags thou knowest none , but art despised for the contrary . There 's a medlar for thee , eat it .
TIMON : On what I hate I feed not .
APEMANTUS : Dost hate a medlar ?
TIMON : Ay , though it look like thee .
APEMANTUS : An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner , thou shouldst have loved thyself better now . What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means ?
TIMON : Who , without those means thou talkest of , didst thou ever know beloved ?
APEMANTUS : Myself .
TIMON : I understand thee ; thou hadst some means to keep a dog .
APEMANTUS : What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers ?
TIMON : Women nearest ; but men , men are the things themselves . What wouldst thou do with the world , Apemantus , if it lay in thy power ?
APEMANTUS : Give it the beasts , to be rid of the men .
TIMON : Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men , and remain a beast with the beasts ?
APEMANTUS : Ay , Timon .
TIMON : A beastly ambition , which the gods grant thee t ' attain to ! If thou wert the lion , the fox would beguile thee ; if thou wert the lamb , the fox would eat three : if thou wert the fox , the lion would suspect thee , when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass : if thou wert the ass , thy dulness would torment thee , and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf : if thou wert the wolf , thy greediness would afflict thee , and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner : wert thou the unicorn , pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury : wert thou a bear , thou wouldst be killed by the horse : wert thou a horse , thou wouldst be seized by the leopard : wert thou a leopard , thou wert german to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life : all thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence . What beast couldst thou be , that were not subject to a beast ? and what a beast art thou already , that seest not thy loss in transformation !
APEMANTUS : If thou couldst please me with speaking to me , thou mightst have hit upon it here : the commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts .
TIMON : How has the ass broke the wall , that thou art out of the city ?
APEMANTUS : Yonder comes a poet and a painter : the plague of company light upon thee ! I will fear to catch it and give way : when I know not what else to do , I 'll see thee again .
TIMON : When there is nothing living but thee , thou shalt be welcome . I had rather be a beggar 's dog than Apemantus .
APEMANTUS : Thou art the cap of all the fools alive .
TIMON : Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon !
APEMANTUS : A plague on thee ! thou art too bad to curse .
TIMON : All villains that do stand by thee are pure .
APEMANTUS : There is no leprosy but what thou speak 'st .
TIMON : If I name thee . I 'll beat thee , but I should infect my hands .
APEMANTUS : I would my tongue could rot them off !
