Second Lord : In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business , but he would not hear my excuse . I am sorry , when he sent to borrow of me , that my provision was out .
First Lord : I am sick of that grief too , as I understand how all things go .
Second Lord : Every man here 's so . What would he have borrowed of you ?
First Lord : A thousand pieces .
Second Lord : A thousand pieces !
First Lord : What of you ?
Second Lord : He sent to me , sir , --Here he comes . Enter TIMON and Attendants
TIMON : With all my heart , gentlemen both ; and how fare you ?
First Lord : Ever at the best , hearing well of your lordship .
Second Lord : The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship .
TIMON : Nor more willingly leaves winter ; such summer-birds are men . Gentlemen , our dinner will not recompense this long stay : feast your ears with the music awhile , if they will fare so harshly o ' the trumpet 's sound ; we shall to ' t presently .
First Lord : I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messenger .
TIMON : O , sir , let it not trouble you .
Second Lord : My noble lord , --
TIMON : Ah , my good friend , what cheer ?
Second Lord : My most honourable lord , I am e 'en sick of shame , that , when your lordship this other day sent to me , I was so unfortunate a beggar .
TIMON : Think not on ' t , sir .
Second Lord : If you had sent but two hours before , --
TIMON : Let it not cumber your better remembrance . The banquet brought in Come , bring in all together .
Second Lord : All covered dishes !
First Lord : Royal cheer , I warrant you .
Third Lord : Doubt not that , if money and the season can yield it .
First Lord : How do you ? What 's the news ?
Third Lord : Alcibiades is banished : hear you of it ?
First Lord Second Lord : Alcibiades banished !
Third Lord : ' Tis so , be sure of it .
First Lord : How ! how !
Second Lord : I pray you , upon what ?
TIMON : My worthy friends , will you draw near ?
Third Lord : I 'll tell you more anon . Here 's a noble feast toward .
Second Lord : This is the old man still .
Third Lord : Will ' t hold ? will ' t hold ?
Second Lord : It does : but time will--and so--
Third Lord : I do conceive .
TIMON : Each man to his stool , with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress : your diet shall be in all places alike . Make not a city feast of it , to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place : sit , sit . The gods require our thanks . You great benefactors , sprinkle our society with thankfulness . For your own gifts , make yourselves praised : but reserve still to give , lest your deities be despised . Lend to each man enough , that one need not lend to another ; for , were your godheads to borrow of men , men would forsake the gods . Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it . Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains : if there sit twelve women at the table , let a dozen of them be--as they are . The rest of your fees , O gods--the senators of Athens , together with the common lag of people--what is amiss in them , you gods , make suitable for destruction . For these my present friends , as they are to me nothing , so in nothing bless them , and to nothing are they welcome . Uncover , dogs , and lap . The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water
Some Speak : What does his lordship mean ?
Some Others : I know not .
