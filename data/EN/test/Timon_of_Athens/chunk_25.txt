TIMON : Nor on the beasts themselves , the birds , and fishes ; You must eat men . Yet thanks I must you con That you are thieves profess 'd , that you work not In holier shapes : for there is boundless theft In limited professions . Rascal thieves , Here 's gold . Go , suck the subtle blood o ' the grape , Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth , And so ' scape hanging : trust not the physician ; His antidotes are poison , and he slays Moe than you rob : take wealth and lives together ; Do villany , do , since you protest to do 't , Like workmen . I 'll example you with thievery . The sun 's a thief , and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea : the moon 's an arrant thief , And her pale fire she snatches from the sun : The sea 's a thief , whose liquid surge resolves The moon into salt tears : the earth 's a thief , That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen From general excrement : each thing 's a thief : The laws , your curb and whip , in their rough power Have uncheque 'd theft . Love not yourselves : away , Rob one another . There 's more gold . Cut throats : All that you meet are thieves : to Athens go , Break open shops ; nothing can you steal , But thieves do lose it : steal no less for this I give you ; and gold confound you howsoe 'er ! Amen .
Third Bandit : Has almost charmed me from my profession , by persuading me to it .
First Bandit : ' Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us ; not to have us thrive in our mystery .
Second Bandit : I 'll believe him as an enemy , and give over my trade .
First Bandit : Let us first see peace in Athens : there is no time so miserable but a man may be true . Enter FLAVIUS
FLAVIUS : O you gods ! Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord ? Full of decay and failing ? O monument And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow 'd ! What an alteration of honour Has desperate want made ! What viler thing upon the earth than friends Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends ! How rarely does it meet with this time 's guise , When man was wish 'd to love his enemies ! Grant I may ever love , and rather woo Those that would mischief me than those that do ! Has caught me in his eye : I will present My honest grief unto him ; and , as my lord , Still serve him with my life . My dearest master !
TIMON : Away ! what art thou ?
FLAVIUS : Have you forgot me , sir ?
TIMON : Why dost ask that ? I have forgot all men ; Then , if thou grant 'st thou 'rt a man , I have forgot thee .
FLAVIUS : An honest poor servant of yours .
TIMON : Then I know thee not : I never had honest man about me , I ; all I kept were knaves , to serve in meat to villains .
FLAVIUS : The gods are witness , Ne 'er did poor steward wear a truer grief For his undone lord than mine eyes for you .
TIMON : What , dost thou weep ? Come nearer . Then I love thee , Because thou art a woman , and disclaim 'st Flinty mankind ; whose eyes do never give But thorough lust and laughter . Pity 's sleeping : Strange times , that weep with laughing , not with weeping !
FLAVIUS : I beg of you to know me , good my lord , To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts To entertain me as your steward still .
TIMON : Had I a steward So true , so just , and now so comfortable ? It almost turns my dangerous nature mild . Let me behold thy face . Surely , this man Was born of woman . Forgive my general and exceptless rashness , You perpetual-sober gods ! I do proclaim One honest man--mistake me not--but one ; No more , I pray , --and he 's a steward . How fain would I have hated all mankind ! And thou redeem 'st thyself : but all , save thee , I fell with curses . Methinks thou art more honest now than wise ; For , by oppressing and betraying me , Thou mightst have sooner got another service : For many so arrive at second masters , Upon their first lord 's neck . But tell me true-- For I must ever doubt , though ne 'er so sure-- Is not thy kindness subtle , covetous , If not a usuring kindness , and , as rich men deal gifts , Expecting in return twenty for one ?
FLAVIUS : No , my most worthy master ; in whose breast Doubt and suspect , alas , are placed too late : You should have fear 'd false times when you did feast : Suspect still comes where an estate is least . That which I show , heaven knows , is merely love , Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind , Care of your food and living ; and , believe it , My most honour 'd lord , For any benefit that points to me , Either in hope or present , I 'ld exchange For this one wish , that you had power and wealth To requite me , by making rich yourself .
