Poet : Sir , I have upon a high and pleasant hill Feign 'd Fortune to be throned : the base o ' the mount Is rank 'd with all deserts , all kind of natures , That labour on the bosom of this sphere To propagate their states : amongst them all , Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix 'd , One do I personate of Lord Timon 's frame , Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her ; Whose present grace to present slaves and servants Translates his rivals .
Painter : ' Tis conceived to scope . This throne , this Fortune , and this hill , methinks , With one man beckon 'd from the rest below , Bowing his head against the sleepy mount To climb his happiness , would be well express 'd In our condition .
Poet : Nay , sir , but hear me on . All those which were his fellows but of late , Some better than his value , on the moment Follow his strides , his lobbies fill with tendance , Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear , Make sacred even his stirrup , and through him Drink the free air .
Painter : Ay , marry , what of these ?
Poet : When Fortune in her shift and change of mood Spurns down her late beloved , all his dependants Which labour 'd after him to the mountain 's top Even on their knees and hands , let him slip down , Not one accompanying his declining foot .
Painter : ' Tis common : A thousand moral paintings I can show That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune 's More pregnantly than words . Yet you do well To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen The foot above the head . Trumpets sound . Enter TIMON , addressing himself courteously to every suitor ; a Messenger from VENTIDIUS talking with him ; LUCILIUS and other servants following
TIMON : Imprison 'd is he , say you ?
Messenger : Ay , my good lord : five talents is his debt , His means most short , his creditors most strait : Your honourable letter he desires To those have shut him up ; which failing , Periods his comfort .
TIMON : Noble Ventidius ! Well ; I am not of that feather to shake off My friend when he must need me . I do know him A gentleman that well deserves a help : Which he shall have : I 'll pay the debt , and free him .
Messenger : Your lordship ever binds him .
TIMON : Commend me to him : I will send his ransom ; And being enfranchised , bid him come to me . ' Tis not enough to help the feeble up , But to support him after . Fare you well .
Messenger : All happiness to your honour ! Exit Enter an old Athenian
Old Athenian : Lord Timon , hear me speak .
TIMON : Freely , good father .
Old Athenian : Thou hast a servant named Lucilius .
TIMON : I have so : what of him ?
Old Athenian : Most noble Timon , call the man before thee .
TIMON : Attends he here , or no ? Lucilius !
LUCILIUS : Here , at your lordship 's service .
Old Athenian : This fellow here , Lord Timon , this thy creature , By night frequents my house . I am a man That from my first have been inclined to thrift ; And my estate deserves an heir more raised Than one which holds a trencher .
TIMON : Well ; what further ?
Old Athenian : One only daughter have I , no kin else , On whom I may confer what I have got : The maid is fair , o ' the youngest for a bride , And I have bred her at my dearest cost In qualities of the best . This man of thine Attempts her love : I prithee , noble lord , Join with me to forbid him her resort ; Myself have spoke in vain .
TIMON : The man is honest .
Old Athenian : Therefore he will be , Timon : His honesty rewards him in itself ; It must not bear my daughter .
TIMON : Does she love him ?
Old Athenian : She is young and apt : Our own precedent passions do instruct us What levity 's in youth .
TIMON : Love you the maid ?
LUCILIUS : Ay , my good lord , and she accepts of it .
Old Athenian : If in her marriage my consent be missing , I call the gods to witness , I will choose Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world , And dispossess her all .
TIMON : How shall she be endow 'd , if she be mated with an equal husband ?
