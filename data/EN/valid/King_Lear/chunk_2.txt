KING LEAR : Kent , on thy life , no more .
KENT : My life I never held but as a pawn To wage against thy enemies ; nor fear to lose it , Thy safety being the motive .
KING LEAR : Out of my sight !
KENT : See better , Lear ; and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye .
KING LEAR : Now , by Apollo , --
KENT : Now , by Apollo , king , Thou swear 'st thy gods in vain .
KING LEAR : O , vassal ! miscreant ! Laying his hand on his sword
ALBANY CORNWALL : Dear sir , forbear .
KENT : Do : Kill thy physician , and the fee bestow Upon thy foul disease . Revoke thy doom ; Or , whilst I can vent clamour from my throat , I 'll tell thee thou dost evil .
KING LEAR : Hear me , recreant ! On thine allegiance , hear me ! Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow , Which we durst never yet , and with strain 'd pride To come between our sentence and our power , Which nor our nature nor our place can bear , Our potency made good , take thy reward . Five days we do allot thee , for provision To shield thee from diseases of the world ; And on the sixth to turn thy hated back Upon our kingdom : if , on the tenth day following , Thy banish 'd trunk be found in our dominions , The moment is thy death . Away ! by Jupiter , This shall not be revoked .
KENT : Fare thee well , king : sith thus thou wilt appear , Freedom lives hence , and banishment is here . To CORDELIA The gods to their dear shelter take thee , maid , That justly think 'st , and hast most rightly said ! To REGAN and GONERIL And your large speeches may your deeds approve , That good effects may spring from words of love . Thus Kent , O princes , bids you all adieu ; He 'll shape his old course in a country new . Exit Flourish . Re-enter GLOUCESTER , with KING OF FRANCE , BURGUNDY , and Attendants
GLOUCESTER : Here 's France and Burgundy , my noble lord .
KING LEAR : My lord of Burgundy . We first address towards you , who with this king Hath rivall 'd for our daughter : what , in the least , Will you require in present dower with her , Or cease your quest of love ?
BURGUNDY : Most royal majesty , I crave no more than what your highness offer 'd , Nor will you tender less .
KING LEAR : Right noble Burgundy , When she was dear to us , we did hold her so ; But now her price is fall 'n . Sir , there she stands : If aught within that little seeming substance , Or all of it , with our displeasure pieced , And nothing more , may fitly like your grace , She 's there , and she is yours .
BURGUNDY : I know no answer .
KING LEAR : Will you , with those infirmities she owes , Unfriended , new-adopted to our hate , Dower 'd with our curse , and stranger 'd with our oath , Take her , or leave her ?
BURGUNDY : Pardon me , royal sir ; Election makes not up on such conditions .
KING LEAR : Then leave her , sir ; for , by the power that made me , I tell you all her wealth . To KING OF FRANCE For you , great king , I would not from your love make such a stray , To match you where I hate ; therefore beseech you To avert your liking a more worthier way Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed Almost to acknowledge hers .
