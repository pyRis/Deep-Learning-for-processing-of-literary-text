KENT : Sir , in good sooth , in sincere verity , Under the allowance of your great aspect , Whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus ' front , --
CORNWALL : What mean 'st by this ?
KENT : To go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much . I know , sir , I am no flatterer : he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave ; which for my part I will not be , though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to ' t .
CORNWALL : What was the offence you gave him ?
OSWALD : I never gave him any : It pleased the king his master very late To strike at me , upon his misconstruction ; When he , conjunct and flattering his displeasure , Tripp 'd me behind ; being down , insulted , rail 'd , And put upon him such a deal of man , That worthied him , got praises of the king For him attempting who was self-subdued ; And , in the fleshment of this dread exploit , Drew on me here again .
KENT : None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool .
CORNWALL : Fetch forth the stocks ! You stubborn ancient knave , you reverend braggart , We 'll teach you--
KENT : Sir , I am too old to learn : Call not your stocks for me : I serve the king ; On whose employment I was sent to you : You shall do small respect , show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master , Stocking his messenger .
CORNWALL : Fetch forth the stocks ! As I have life and honour , There shall he sit till noon .
REGAN : Till noon ! till night , my lord ; and all night too .
KENT : Why , madam , if I were your father 's dog , You should not use me so .
REGAN : Sir , being his knave , I will .
CORNWALL : This is a fellow of the self-same colour Our sister speaks of . Come , bring away the stocks ! Stocks brought out
GLOUCESTER : Let me beseech your grace not to do so : His fault is much , and the good king his master Will cheque him for ' t : your purposed low correction Is such as basest and contemned 'st wretches For pilferings and most common trespasses Are punish 'd with : the king must take it ill , That he 's so slightly valued in his messenger , Should have him thus restrain 'd .
CORNWALL : I 'll answer that .
REGAN : My sister may receive it much more worse , To have her gentleman abused , assaulted , For following her affairs . Put in his legs . KENT is put in the stocks Come , my good lord , away .
GLOUCESTER : I am sorry for thee , friend ; ' tis the duke 's pleasure , Whose disposition , all the world well knows , Will not be rubb 'd nor stopp 'd : I 'll entreat for thee .
KENT : Pray , do not , sir : I have watched and travell 'd hard ; Some time I shall sleep out , the rest I 'll whistle . A good man 's fortune may grow out at heels : Give you good morrow !
GLOUCESTER : The duke 's to blame in this ; ' twill be ill taken . Exit
KENT : Good king , that must approve the common saw , Thou out of heaven 's benediction comest To the warm sun ! Approach , thou beacon to this under globe , That by thy comfortable beams I may Peruse this letter ! Nothing almost sees miracles But misery : I know ' tis from Cordelia , Who hath most fortunately been inform 'd Of my obscured course ; and shall find time From this enormous state , seeking to give Losses their remedies . All weary and o 'erwatch 'd , Take vantage , heavy eyes , not to behold This shameful lodging . Fortune , good night : smile once more : turn thy wheel ! Sleeps Enter EDGAR
