OSWALD : Why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee !
KENT : What a brazen-faced varlet art thou , to deny thou knowest me ! Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels , and beat thee before the king ? Draw , you rogue : for , though it be night , yet the moon shines ; I 'll make a sop o ' the moonshine of you : draw , you whoreson cullionly barber-monger , draw . Drawing his sword
OSWALD : Away ! I have nothing to do with thee .
KENT : Draw , you rascal : you come with letters against the king ; and take vanity the puppet 's part against the royalty of her father : draw , you rogue , or I 'll so carbonado your shanks : draw , you rascal ; come your ways .
OSWALD : Help , ho ! murder ! help !
KENT : Strike , you slave ; stand , rogue , stand ; you neat slave , strike . Beating him
OSWALD : Help , ho ! murder ! murder ! Enter EDMUND , with his rapier drawn , CORNWALL , REGAN , GLOUCESTER , and Servants
EDMUND : How now ! What 's the matter ?
KENT : With you , goodman boy , an you please : come , I 'll flesh ye ; come on , young master .
GLOUCESTER : Weapons ! arms ! What ' s the matter here ?
CORNWALL : Keep peace , upon your lives : He dies that strikes again . What is the matter ?
REGAN : The messengers from our sister and the king .
CORNWALL : What is your difference ? speak .
OSWALD : I am scarce in breath , my lord .
KENT : No marvel , you have so bestirred your valour . You cowardly rascal , nature disclaims in thee : a tailor made thee .
CORNWALL : Thou art a strange fellow : a tailor make a man ?
KENT : Ay , a tailor , sir : a stone-cutter or painter could not have made him so ill , though he had been but two hours at the trade .
CORNWALL : Speak yet , how grew your quarrel ?
OSWALD : This ancient ruffian , sir , whose life I have spared at suit of his gray beard , --
KENT : Thou whoreson zed ! thou unnecessary letter ! My lord , if you will give me leave , I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar , and daub the wall of a jakes with him . Spare my gray beard , you wagtail ?
CORNWALL : Peace , sirrah ! You beastly knave , know you no reverence ?
KENT : Yes , sir ; but anger hath a privilege .
CORNWALL : Why art thou angry ?
KENT : That such a slave as this should wear a sword , Who wears no honesty . Such smiling rogues as these , Like rats , oft bite the holy cords a-twain Which are too intrinse t ' unloose ; smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel ; Bring oil to fire , snow to their colder moods ; Renege , affirm , and turn their halcyon beaks With every gale and vary of their masters , Knowing nought , like dogs , but following . A plague upon your epileptic visage ! Smile you my speeches , as I were a fool ? Goose , if I had you upon Sarum plain , I 'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot .
CORNWALL : Why , art thou mad , old fellow ?
GLOUCESTER : How fell you out ? say that .
KENT : No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave .
CORNWALL : Why dost thou call him a knave ? What 's his offence ?
KENT : His countenance likes me not .
CORNWALL : No more , perchance , does mine , nor his , nor hers .
KENT : Sir , ' tis my occupation to be plain : I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant .
