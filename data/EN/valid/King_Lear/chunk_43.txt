KENT : If fortune brag of two she loved and hated , One of them we behold .
KING LEAR : This is a dull sight . Are you not Kent ?
KENT : The same , Your servant Kent : Where is your servant Caius ?
KING LEAR : He 's a good fellow , I can tell you that ; He 'll strike , and quickly too : he 's dead and rotten .
KENT : No , my good lord ; I am the very man , --
KING LEAR : I 'll see that straight .
KENT : That , from your first of difference and decay , Have follow 'd your sad steps .
KING LEAR : You are welcome hither .
KENT : Nor no man else : all 's cheerless , dark , and deadly . Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves , And desperately are dead .
KING LEAR : Ay , so I think .
ALBANY : He knows not what he says : and vain it is That we present us to him .
EDGAR : Very bootless . Enter a Captain
Captain : Edmund is dead , my lord .
ALBANY : That 's but a trifle here . You lords and noble friends , know our intent . What comfort to this great decay may come Shall be applied : for us we will resign , During the life of this old majesty , To him our absolute power : To EDGAR and KENT you , to your rights : With boot , and such addition as your honours Have more than merited . All friends shall taste The wages of their virtue , and all foes The cup of their deservings . O , see , see !
KING LEAR : And my poor fool is hang 'd ! No , no , no life ! Why should a dog , a horse , a rat , have life , And thou no breath at all ? Thou 'lt come no more , Never , never , never , never , never ! Pray you , undo this button : thank you , sir . Do you see this ? Look on her , look , her lips , Look there , look there ! Dies
EDGAR : He faints ! My lord , my lord !
KENT : Break , heart ; I prithee , break !
EDGAR : Look up , my lord .
KENT : Vex not his ghost : O , let him pass ! he hates him much That would upon the rack of this tough world Stretch him out longer .
EDGAR : He is gone , indeed .
KENT : The wonder is , he hath endured so long : He but usurp 'd his life .
ALBANY : Bear them from hence . Our present business Is general woe . To KENT and EDGAR Friends of my soul , you twain Rule in this realm , and the gored state sustain .
KENT : I have a journey , sir , shortly to go ; My master calls me , I must not say no .
