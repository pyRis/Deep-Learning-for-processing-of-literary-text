KENT : Where learned you this , fool ?
Fool : Not i ' the stocks , fool . Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER
KING LEAR : Deny to speak with me ? They are sick ? they are weary ? They have travell 'd all the night ? Mere fetches ; The images of revolt and flying off . Fetch me a better answer .
GLOUCESTER : My dear lord , You know the fiery quality of the duke ; How unremoveable and fix 'd he is In his own course .
KING LEAR : Vengeance ! plague ! death ! confusion ! Fiery ? what quality ? Why , Gloucester , Gloucester , I 'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
GLOUCESTER : Well , my good lord , I have inform 'd them so .
KING LEAR : Inform 'd them ! Dost thou understand me , man ?
GLOUCESTER : Ay , my good lord .
KING LEAR : The king would speak with Cornwall ; the dear father Would with his daughter speak , commands her service : Are they inform 'd of this ? My breath and blood ! Fiery ? the fiery duke ? Tell the hot duke that-- No , but not yet : may be he is not well : Infirmity doth still neglect all office Whereto our health is bound ; we are not ourselves When nature , being oppress 'd , commands the mind To suffer with the body : I 'll forbear ; And am fall 'n out with my more headier will , To take the indisposed and sickly fit For the sound man . Death on my state ! wherefore Looking on KENT Should he sit here ? This act persuades me That this remotion of the duke and her Is practise only . Give me my servant forth . Go tell the duke and ' s wife I 'ld speak with them , Now , presently : bid them come forth and hear me , Or at their chamber-door I 'll beat the drum Till it cry sleep to death .
GLOUCESTER : I would have all well betwixt you . Exit
KING LEAR : O me , my heart , my rising heart ! but , down !
Fool : Cry to it , nuncle , as the cockney did to the eels when she put ' em i ' the paste alive ; she knapped ' em o ' the coxcombs with a stick , and cried ' Down , wantons , down ! ' ' Twas her brother that , in pure kindness to his horse , buttered his hay . Enter CORNWALL , REGAN , GLOUCESTER , and Servants
KING LEAR : Good morrow to you both .
CORNWALL : Hail to your grace ! KENT is set at liberty
REGAN : I am glad to see your highness .
KING LEAR : Regan , I think you are ; I know what reason I have to think so : if thou shouldst not be glad , I would divorce me from thy mother 's tomb , Sepulchring an adultress . To KENT O , are you free ? Some other time for that . Beloved Regan , Thy sister 's naught : O Regan , she hath tied Sharp-tooth 'd unkindness , like a vulture , here : Points to his heart I can scarce speak to thee ; thou 'lt not believe With how depraved a quality--O Regan !
REGAN : I pray you , sir , take patience : I have hope . You less know how to value her desert Than she to scant her duty .
KING LEAR : Say , how is that ?
REGAN : I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation : if , sir , perchance She have restrain 'd the riots of your followers , ' Tis on such ground , and to such wholesome end , As clears her from all blame .
KING LEAR : My curses on her !
REGAN : O , sir , you are old . Nature in you stands on the very verge Of her confine : you should be ruled and led By some discretion , that discerns your state Better than you yourself . Therefore , I pray you , That to our sister you do make return ; Say you have wrong 'd her , sir .
