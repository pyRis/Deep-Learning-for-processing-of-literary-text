EDMUND : How comes that ?
CURAN : Nay , I know not . You have heard of the news abroad ; I mean the whispered ones , for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments ?
EDMUND : Not I pray you , what are they ?
CURAN : Have you heard of no likely wars toward , ' twixt the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
EDMUND : Not a word .
CURAN : You may do , then , in time . Fare you well , sir . Exit
EDMUND : The duke be here to-night ? The better ! best ! This weaves itself perforce into my business . My father hath set guard to take my brother ; And I have one thing , of a queasy question , Which I must act : briefness and fortune , work ! Brother , a word ; descend : brother , I say ! Enter EDGAR My father watches : O sir , fly this place ; Intelligence is given where you are hid ; You have now the good advantage of the night : Have you not spoken ' gainst the Duke of Cornwall ? He 's coming hither : now , i ' the night , i ' the haste , And Regan with him : have you nothing said Upon his party ' gainst the Duke of Albany ? Advise yourself .
EDGAR : I am sure on 't , not a word .
EDMUND : I hear my father coming : pardon me : In cunning I must draw my sword upon you Draw ; seem to defend yourself ; now quit you well . Yield : come before my father . Light , ho , here ! Fly , brother . Torches , torches ! So , farewell . Exit EDGAR Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion . Wounds his arm Of my more fierce endeavour : I have seen drunkards Do more than this in sport . Father , father ! Stop , stop ! No help ? Enter GLOUCESTER , and Servants with torches
GLOUCESTER : Now , Edmund , where 's the villain ?
EDMUND : Here stood he in the dark , his sharp sword out , Mumbling of wicked charms , conjuring the moon To stand auspicious mistress , --
GLOUCESTER : But where is he ?
EDMUND : Look , sir , I bleed .
GLOUCESTER : Where is the villain , Edmund ?
EDMUND : Fled this way , sir . When by no means he could--
GLOUCESTER : Pursue him , ho ! Go after . By no means what ?
EDMUND : Persuade me to the murder of your lordship ; But that I told him , the revenging gods ' Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend ; Spoke , with how manifold and strong a bond The child was bound to the father ; sir , in fine , Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose , in fell motion , With his prepared sword , he charges home My unprovided body , lanced mine arm : But when he saw my best alarum 'd spirits , Bold in the quarrel 's right , roused to the encounter , Or whether gasted by the noise I made , Full suddenly he fled .
GLOUCESTER : Let him fly far : Not in this land shall he remain uncaught ; And found--dispatch . The noble duke my master , My worthy arch and patron , comes to-night : By his authority I will proclaim it , That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks , Bringing the murderous coward to the stake ; He that conceals him , death .
