EDGAR : Bless thy five wits !
KENT : O pity ! Sir , where is the patience now , That thou so oft have boasted to retain ?
EDGAR : My tears begin to take his part so much , They 'll mar my counterfeiting .
KING LEAR : The little dogs and all , Tray , Blanch , and Sweet-heart , see , they bark at me .
EDGAR : Tom will throw his head at them . Avaunt , you curs ! Be thy mouth or black or white , Tooth that poisons if it bite ; Mastiff , grey-hound , mongrel grim , Hound or spaniel , brach or lym , Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail , Tom will make them weep and wail : For , with throwing thus my head , Dogs leap the hatch , and all are fled . Do de , de , de . Sessa ! Come , march to wakes and fairs and market-towns . Poor Tom , thy horn is dry .
KING LEAR : Then let them anatomize Regan ; see what breeds about her heart . Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts ? To EDGAR You , sir , I entertain for one of my hundred ; only I do not like the fashion of your garments : you will say they are Persian attire : but let them be changed .
KENT : Now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile .
KING LEAR : Make no noise , make no noise ; draw the curtains : so , so , so . We 'll go to supper i ' he morning . So , so , so .
Fool : And I 'll go to bed at noon . Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER : Come hither , friend : where is the king my master ?
KENT : Here , sir ; but trouble him not , his wits are gone .
GLOUCESTER : Good friend , I prithee , take him in thy arms ; I have o 'erheard a plot of death upon him : There is a litter ready ; lay him in ' t , And drive towards Dover , friend , where thou shalt meet Both welcome and protection . Take up thy master : If thou shouldst dally half an hour , his life , With thine , and all that offer to defend him , Stand in assured loss : take up , take up ; And follow me , that will to some provision Give thee quick conduct .
KENT : Oppressed nature sleeps : This rest might yet have balm 'd thy broken senses , Which , if convenience will not allow , Stand in hard cure . To the Fool Come , help to bear thy master ; Thou must not stay behind .
GLOUCESTER : Come , come , away .
EDGAR : When we our betters see bearing our woes , We scarcely think our miseries our foes . Who alone suffers suffers most i ' the mind , Leaving free things and happy shows behind : But then the mind much sufferance doth o 'er skip , When grief hath mates , and bearing fellowship . How light and portable my pain seems now , When that which makes me bend makes the king bow , He childed as I father 'd ! Tom , away ! Mark the high noises ; and thyself bewray , When false opinion , whose wrong thought defiles thee , In thy just proof , repeals and reconciles thee . What will hap more to-night , safe ' scape the king ! Lurk , lurk . Exit Enter CORNWALL , REGAN , GONERIL , EDMUND , and Servants
CORNWALL : Post speedily to my lord your husband ; show him this letter : the army of France is landed . Seek out the villain Gloucester .
REGAN : Hang him instantly .
GONERIL : Pluck out his eyes .
