GLOUCESTER : Alack , alack the day !
KING LEAR : When we are born , we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools : this a good block ; It were a delicate stratagem , to shoe A troop of horse with felt : I 'll put ' t in proof ; And when I have stol 'n upon these sons-in-law , Then , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill ! Enter a Gentleman , with Attendants
Gentleman : O , here he is : lay hand upon him . Sir , Your most dear daughter--
KING LEAR : No rescue ? What , a prisoner ? I am even The natural fool of fortune . Use me well ; You shall have ransom . Let me have surgeons ; I am cut to the brains .
Gentleman : You shall have any thing .
KING LEAR : No seconds ? all myself ? Why , this would make a man a man of salt , To use his eyes for garden water-pots , Ay , and laying autumn 's dust .
Gentleman : Good sir , --
KING LEAR : I will die bravely , like a bridegroom . What ! I will be jovial : come , come ; I am a king , My masters , know you that .
Gentleman : You are a royal one , and we obey you .
KING LEAR : Then there 's life in 't . Nay , if you get it , you shall get it with running . Sa , sa , sa , sa . Exit running ; Attendants follow
Gentleman : A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , Past speaking of in a king ! Thou hast one daughter , Who redeems nature from the general curse Which twain have brought her to .
EDGAR : Hail , gentle sir .
Gentleman : Sir , speed you : what 's your will ?
EDGAR : Do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward ?
Gentleman : Most sure and vulgar : every one hears that , Which can distinguish sound .
EDGAR : But , by your favour , How near 's the other army ?
Gentleman : Near and on speedy foot ; the main descry Stands on the hourly thought .
EDGAR : I thank you , sir : that 's all .
Gentleman : Though that the queen on special cause is here , Her army is moved on .
EDGAR : I thank you , sir . Exit Gentleman
GLOUCESTER : You ever-gentle gods , take my breath from me : Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please !
EDGAR : Well pray you , father .
GLOUCESTER : Now , good sir , what are you ?
EDGAR : A most poor man , made tame to fortune 's blows ; Who , by the art of known and feeling sorrows , Am pregnant to good pity . Give me your hand , I 'll lead you to some biding .
GLOUCESTER : Hearty thanks : The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot , and boot ! Enter OSWALD
OSWALD : A proclaim 'd prize ! Most happy ! That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh To raise my fortunes . Thou old unhappy traitor , Briefly thyself remember : the sword is out That must destroy thee .
GLOUCESTER : Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to 't . EDGAR interposes
OSWALD : Wherefore , bold peasant , Darest thou support a publish 'd traitor ? Hence ; Lest that the infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee . Let go his arm .
EDGAR : Ch 'ill not let go , zir , without vurther ' casion .
OSWALD : Let go , slave , or thou diest !
EDGAR : Good gentleman , go your gait , and let poor volk pass . An chud ha ' bin zwaggered out of my life , ' twould not ha ' bin zo long as ' tis by a vortnight . Nay , come not near th ' old man ; keep out , che vor ye , or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder : ch 'ill be plain with you .
OSWALD : Out , dunghill !
