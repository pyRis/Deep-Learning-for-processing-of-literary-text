EDGAR : This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet : he begins at curfew , and walks till the first cock ; he gives the web and the pin , squints the eye , and makes the hare-lip ; mildews the white wheat , and hurts the poor creature of earth . S. Withold footed thrice the old ; He met the night-mare , and her nine-fold ; Bid her alight , And her troth plight , And , aroint thee , witch , aroint thee !
KENT : How fares your grace ?
KING LEAR : What 's he ?
KENT : Who 's there ? What is 't you seek ?
GLOUCESTER : What are you there ? Your names ?
EDGAR : Poor Tom ; that eats the swimming frog , the toad , the tadpole , the wall-newt and the water ; that in the fury of his heart , when the foul fiend rages , eats cow-dung for sallets ; swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog ; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool ; who is whipped from tithing to tithing , and stock- punished , and imprisoned ; who hath had three suits to his back , six shirts to his body , horse to ride , and weapon to wear ; But mice and rats , and such small deer , Have been Tom 's food for seven long year . Beware my follower . Peace , Smulkin ; peace , thou fiend !
GLOUCESTER : What , hath your grace no better company ?
EDGAR : The prince of darkness is a gentleman : Modo he 's call 'd , and Mahu .
GLOUCESTER : Our flesh and blood is grown so vile , my lord , That it doth hate what gets it .
EDGAR : Poor Tom 's a-cold .
GLOUCESTER : Go in with me : my duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters ' hard commands : Though their injunction be to bar my doors , And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you , Yet have I ventured to come seek you out , And bring you where both fire and food is ready .
KING LEAR : First let me talk with this philosopher . What is the cause of thunder ?
KENT : Good my lord , take his offer ; go into the house .
KING LEAR : I 'll talk a word with this same learned Theban . What is your study ?
EDGAR : How to prevent the fiend , and to kill vermin .
KING LEAR : Let me ask you one word in private .
KENT : Importune him once more to go , my lord ; His wits begin to unsettle .
GLOUCESTER : Canst thou blame him ? Storm still His daughters seek his death : ah , that good Kent ! He said it would be thus , poor banish 'd man ! Thou say 'st the king grows mad ; I 'll tell thee , friend , I am almost mad myself : I had a son , Now outlaw 'd from my blood ; he sought my life , But lately , very late : I loved him , friend ; No father his son dearer : truth to tell thee , The grief hath crazed my wits . What a night 's this ! I do beseech your grace , --
KING LEAR : O , cry your mercy , sir . Noble philosopher , your company .
EDGAR : Tom 's a-cold .
GLOUCESTER : In , fellow , there , into the hovel : keep thee warm .
KING LEAR : Come let 's in all .
KENT : This way , my lord .
KING LEAR : With him ; I will keep still with my philosopher .
KENT : Good my lord , soothe him ; let him take the fellow .
GLOUCESTER : Take him you on .
KENT : Sirrah , come on ; go along with us .
KING LEAR : Come , good Athenian .
GLOUCESTER : No words , no words : hush .
EDGAR : Child Rowland to the dark tower came , His word was still , --Fie , foh , and fum , I smell the blood of a British man . Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND
CORNWALL : I will have my revenge ere I depart his house .
