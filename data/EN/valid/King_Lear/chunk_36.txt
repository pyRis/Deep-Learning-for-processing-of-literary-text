OSWALD : Slave , thou hast slain me : villain , take my purse : If ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body ; And give the letters which thou find 'st about me To Edmund earl of Gloucester ; seek him out Upon the British party : O , untimely death ! Dies
EDGAR : I know thee well : a serviceable villain ; As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire .
GLOUCESTER : What , is he dead ?
EDGAR : Sit you down , father ; rest you Let 's see these pockets : the letters that he speaks of May be my friends . He 's dead ; I am only sorry He had no other death 's-man . Let us see : Leave , gentle wax ; and , manners , blame us not : To know our enemies ' minds , we 'ld rip their hearts ; Their papers , is more lawful . Reads ' Let our reciprocal vows be remembered . You have many opportunities to cut him off : if your will want not , time and place will be fruitfully offered . There is nothing done , if he return the conqueror : then am I the prisoner , and his bed my goal ; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me , and supply the place for your labour . ' Your--wife , so I would say-- ' Affectionate servant , ' GONERIL . ' O undistinguish 'd space of woman 's will ! A plot upon her virtuous husband 's life ; And the exchange my brother ! Here , in the sands , Thee I 'll rake up , the post unsanctified Of murderous lechers : and in the mature time With this ungracious paper strike the sight Of the death practised duke : for him ' tis well That of thy death and business I can tell .
GLOUCESTER : The king is mad : how stiff is my vile sense , That I stand up , and have ingenious feeling Of my huge sorrows ! Better I were distract : So should my thoughts be sever 'd from my griefs , And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves .
EDGAR : Give me your hand : Drum afar off Far off , methinks , I hear the beaten drum : Come , father , I 'll bestow you with a friend. soft music playing ; Gentleman , and others attending . Enter CORDELIA , KENT , and Doctor
CORDELIA : O thou good Kent , how shall I live and work , To match thy goodness ? My life will be too short , And every measure fail me .
KENT : To be acknowledged , madam , is o 'erpaid . All my reports go with the modest truth ; Nor more nor clipp 'd , but so .
CORDELIA : Be better suited : These weeds are memories of those worser hours : I prithee , put them off .
KENT : Pardon me , dear madam ; Yet to be known shortens my made intent : My boon I make it , that you know me not Till time and I think meet .
CORDELIA : Then be 't so , my good lord . To the Doctor How does the king ?
Doctor : Madam , sleeps still .
CORDELIA : O you kind gods , Cure this great breach in his abused nature ! The untuned and jarring senses , O , wind up Of this child-changed father !
Doctor : So please your majesty That we may wake the king : he hath slept long .
CORDELIA : Be govern 'd by your knowledge , and proceed I ' the sway of your own will . Is he array 'd ?
Gentleman : Ay , madam ; in the heaviness of his sleep We put fresh garments on him .
Doctor : Be by , good madam , when we do awake him ; I doubt not of his temperance .
CORDELIA : Very well .
Doctor : Please you , draw near . Louder the music there !
CORDELIA : O my dear father ! Restoration hang Thy medicine on my lips ; and let this kiss Repair those violent harms that my two sisters Have in thy reverence made !
