EDGAR : What , in ill thoughts again ? Men must endure Their going hence , even as their coming hither ; Ripeness is all : come on .
GLOUCESTER : And that 's true too . Enter , in conquest , with drum and colours , EDMUND , KING LEAR and CORDELIA , prisoners ; Captain , Soldiers , & c
EDMUND : Some officers take them away : good guard , Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them .
CORDELIA : We are not the first Who , with best meaning , have incurr 'd the worst . For thee , oppressed king , am I cast down ; Myself could else out-frown false fortune 's frown . Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters ?
KING LEAR : No , no , no , no ! Come , let 's away to prison : We two alone will sing like birds i ' the cage : When thou dost ask me blessing , I 'll kneel down , And ask of thee forgiveness : so we 'll live , And pray , and sing , and tell old tales , and laugh At gilded butterflies , and hear poor rogues Talk of court news ; and we 'll talk with them too , Who loses and who wins ; who 's in , who 's out ; And take upon 's the mystery of things , As if we were God 's spies : and we 'll wear out , In a wall 'd prison , packs and sects of great ones , That ebb and flow by the moon .
EDMUND : Take them away .
KING LEAR : Upon such sacrifices , my Cordelia , The gods themselves throw incense . Have I caught thee ? He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven , And fire us hence like foxes . Wipe thine eyes ; The good-years shall devour them , flesh and fell , Ere they shall make us weep : we 'll see ' em starve first . Come .
EDMUND : Come hither , captain ; hark . Take thou this note ; Giving a paper go follow them to prison : One step I have advanced thee ; if thou dost As this instructs thee , thou dost make thy way To noble fortunes : know thou this , that men Are as the time is : to be tender-minded Does not become a sword : thy great employment Will not bear question ; either say thou 'lt do ' t , Or thrive by other means .
Captain : I 'll do ' t , my lord .
EDMUND : About it ; and write happy when thou hast done . Mark , I say , instantly ; and carry it so As I have set it down .
Captain : I cannot draw a cart , nor eat dried oats ; If it be man 's work , I 'll do ' t . Exit Flourish . Enter ALBANY , GONERIL , REGAN , another Captain , and Soldiers
ALBANY : Sir , you have shown to-day your valiant strain , And fortune led you well : you have the captives That were the opposites of this day 's strife : We do require them of you , so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine .
EDMUND : Sir , I thought it fit To send the old and miserable king To some retention and appointed guard ; Whose age has charms in it , whose title more , To pluck the common bosom on his side , An turn our impress 'd lances in our eyes Which do command them . With him I sent the queen ; My reason all the same ; and they are ready To-morrow , or at further space , to appear Where you shall hold your session . At this time We sweat and bleed : the friend hath lost his friend ; And the best quarrels , in the heat , are cursed By those that feel their sharpness : The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place .
ALBANY : Sir , by your patience , I hold you but a subject of this war , Not as a brother .
