KING LEAR : When were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah ?
Fool : I have used it , nuncle , ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers : for when thou gavest them the rod , and put 'st down thine own breeches , Singing Then they for sudden joy did weep , And I for sorrow sung , That such a king should play bo-peep , And go the fools among . Prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie : I would fain learn to lie .
KING LEAR : An you lie , sirrah , we 'll have you whipped .
Fool : I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are : they 'll have me whipped for speaking true , thou 'lt have me whipped for lying ; and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace . I had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool : and yet I would not be thee , nuncle ; thou hast pared thy wit o ' both sides , and left nothing i ' the middle : here comes one o ' the parings . Enter GONERIL
KING LEAR : How now , daughter ! what makes that frontlet on ? Methinks you are too much of late i ' the frown .
Fool : Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning ; now thou art an O without a figure : I am better than thou art now ; I am a fool , thou art nothing . To GONERIL Yes , forsooth , I will hold my tongue ; so your face bids me , though you say nothing . Mum , mum , He that keeps nor crust nor crum , Weary of all , shall want some . Pointing to KING LEAR That 's a shealed peascod .
GONERIL : Not only , sir , this your all-licensed fool , But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel ; breaking forth In rank and not-to-be endured riots . Sir , I had thought , by making this well known unto you , To have found a safe redress ; but now grow fearful , By what yourself too late have spoke and done . That you protect this course , and put it on By your allowance ; which if you should , the fault Would not ' scape censure , nor the redresses sleep , Which , in the tender of a wholesome weal , Might in their working do you that offence , Which else were shame , that then necessity Will call discreet proceeding .
Fool : For , you trow , nuncle , The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long , That it 's had it head bit off by it young . So , out went the candle , and we were left darkling .
KING LEAR : Are you our daughter ?
GONERIL : Come , sir , I would you would make use of that good wisdom , Whereof I know you are fraught ; and put away These dispositions , that of late transform you From what you rightly are .
Fool : May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse ? Whoop , Jug ! I love thee .
KING LEAR : Doth any here know me ? This is not Lear : Doth Lear walk thus ? speak thus ? Where are his eyes ? Either his notion weakens , his discernings Are lethargied--Ha ! waking ? ' tis not so . Who is it that can tell me who I am ?
Fool : Lear 's shadow .
KING LEAR : I would learn that ; for , by the marks of sovereignty , knowledge , and reason , I should be false persuaded I had daughters .
Fool : Which they will make an obedient father .
KING LEAR : Your name , fair gentlewoman ?
