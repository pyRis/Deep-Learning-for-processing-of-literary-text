KENT : O , then it moved her .
Gentleman : Not to a rage : patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest . You have seen Sunshine and rain at once : her smiles and tears Were like a better way : those happy smilets , That play 'd on her ripe lip , seem 'd not to know What guests were in her eyes ; which parted thence , As pearls from diamonds dropp 'd . In brief , Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved , If all could so become it .
KENT : Made she no verbal question ?
Gentleman : ' Faith , once or twice she heaved the name of ' father ' Pantingly forth , as if it press 'd her heart : Cried ' Sisters ! sisters ! Shame of ladies ! sisters ! Kent ! father ! sisters ! What , i ' the storm ? i ' the night ? Let pity not be believed ! ' There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes , And clamour moisten 'd : then away she started To deal with grief alone .
KENT : It is the stars , The stars above us , govern our conditions ; Else one self mate and mate could not beget Such different issues . You spoke not with her since ?
Gentleman : No .
KENT : Was this before the king return 'd ?
Gentleman : No , since .
KENT : Well , sir , the poor distressed Lear 's i ' the town ; Who sometime , in his better tune , remembers What we are come about , and by no means Will yield to see his daughter .
Gentleman : Why , good sir ?
KENT : A sovereign shame so elbows him : his own unkindness , That stripp 'd her from his benediction , turn 'd her To foreign casualties , gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters , these things sting His mind so venomously , that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia .
Gentleman : Alack , poor gentleman !
KENT : Of Albany 's and Cornwall 's powers you heard not ?
Gentleman : ' Tis so , they are afoot .
KENT : Well , sir , I 'll bring you to our master Lear , And leave you to attend him : some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile ; When I am known aright , you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance . I pray you , go Along with me . Enter , with drum and colours , CORDELIA , Doctor , and Soldiers
CORDELIA : Alack , ' tis he : why , he was met even now As mad as the vex 'd sea ; singing aloud ; Crown 'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds , With bur-docks , hemlock , nettles , cuckoo-flowers , Darnel , and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn . A century send forth ; Search every acre in the high-grown field , And bring him to our eye . Exit an Officer What can man 's wisdom In the restoring his bereaved sense ? He that helps him take all my outward worth .
Doctor : There is means , madam : Our foster-nurse of nature is repose , The which he lacks ; that to provoke in him , Are many simples operative , whose power Will close the eye of anguish .
CORDELIA : All blest secrets , All you unpublish 'd virtues of the earth , Spring with my tears ! be aidant and remediate In the good man 's distress ! Seek , seek for him ; Lest his ungovern 'd rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it . Enter a Messenger
Messenger : News , madam ; The British powers are marching hitherward .
CORDELIA : ' Tis known before ; our preparation stands In expectation of them . O dear father , It is thy business that I go about ; Therefore great France My mourning and important tears hath pitied . No blown ambition doth our arms incite , But love , dear love , and our aged father 's right : Soon may I hear and see him ! Enter REGAN and OSWALD
REGAN : But are my brother 's powers set forth ?
OSWALD : Ay , madam .
REGAN : Himself in person there ?
