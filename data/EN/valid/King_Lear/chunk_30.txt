GONERIL : No more ; the text is foolish .
ALBANY : Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile : Filths savour but themselves . What have you done ? Tigers , not daughters , what have you perform 'd ? A father , and a gracious aged man , Whose reverence even the head-lugg 'd bear would lick , Most barbarous , most degenerate ! have you madded . Could my good brother suffer you to do it ? A man , a prince , by him so benefited ! If that the heavens do not their visible spirits Send quickly down to tame these vile offences , It will come , Humanity must perforce prey on itself , Like monsters of the deep .
GONERIL : Milk-liver 'd man ! That bear 'st a cheek for blows , a head for wrongs ; Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning Thine honour from thy suffering ; that not know 'st Fools do those villains pity who are punish 'd Ere they have done their mischief . Where 's thy drum ? France spreads his banners in our noiseless land ; With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats ; Whiles thou , a moral fool , sit 'st still , and criest ' Alack , why does he so ? '
ALBANY : See thyself , devil ! Proper deformity seems not in the fiend So horrid as in woman .
GONERIL : O vain fool !
ALBANY : Thou changed and self-cover 'd thing , for shame , Be-monster not thy feature . Were 't my fitness To let these hands obey my blood , They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones : howe 'er thou art a fiend , A woman 's shape doth shield thee .
GONERIL : Marry , your manhood now-- Enter a Messenger
ALBANY : What news ?
Messenger : O , my good lord , the Duke of Cornwall 's dead : Slain by his servant , going to put out The other eye of Gloucester .
ALBANY : Gloucester 's eye !
Messenger : A servant that he bred , thrill 'd with remorse , Opposed against the act , bending his sword To his great master ; who , thereat enraged , Flew on him , and amongst them fell 'd him dead ; But not without that harmful stroke , which since Hath pluck 'd him after .
ALBANY : This shows you are above , You justicers , that these our nether crimes So speedily can venge ! But , O poor Gloucester ! Lost he his other eye ?
Messenger : Both , both , my lord . This letter , madam , craves a speedy answer ; ' Tis from your sister .
GONERIL : One way I like this well ; But being widow , and my Gloucester with her , May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life : another way , The news is not so tart.--I 'll read , and answer . Exit
ALBANY : Where was his son when they did take his eyes ?
Messenger : Come with my lady hither .
ALBANY : He is not here .
Messenger : No , my good lord ; I met him back again .
ALBANY : Knows he the wickedness ?
Messenger : Ay , my good lord ; ' twas he inform 'd against him ; And quit the house on purpose , that their punishment Might have the freer course .
ALBANY : Gloucester , I live To thank thee for the love thou show 'dst the king , And to revenge thine eyes . Come hither , friend : Tell me what more thou know 'st . Enter KENT and a Gentleman
KENT : Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason ?
Gentleman : Something he left imperfect in the state , which since his coming forth is thought of ; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger , that his personal return was most required and necessary .
KENT : Who hath he left behind him general ?
Gentleman : The Marshal of France , Monsieur La Far .
KENT : Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
