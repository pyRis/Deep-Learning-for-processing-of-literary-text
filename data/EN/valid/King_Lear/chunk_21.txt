KING LEAR : Rumble thy bellyful ! Spit , fire ! spout , rain ! Nor rain , wind , thunder , fire , are my daughters : I tax not you , you elements , with unkindness ; I never gave you kingdom , call 'd you children , You owe me no subscription : then let fall Your horrible pleasure : here I stand , your slave , A poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man : But yet I call you servile ministers , That have with two pernicious daughters join 'd Your high engender 'd battles ' gainst a head So old and white as this . O ! O ! ' tis foul !
Fool : He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece . The cod-piece that will house Before the head has any , The head and he shall louse ; So beggars marry many . The man that makes his toe What he his heart should make Shall of a corn cry woe , And turn his sleep to wake . For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass .
KING LEAR : No , I will be the pattern of all patience ; I will say nothing . Enter KENT
KENT : Who 's there ?
Fool : Marry , here 's grace and a cod-piece ; that 's a wise man and a fool .
KENT : Alas , sir , are you here ? things that love night Love not such nights as these ; the wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark , And make them keep their caves : since I was man , Such sheets of fire , such bursts of horrid thunder , Such groans of roaring wind and rain , I never Remember to have heard : man 's nature cannot carry The affliction nor the fear .
KING LEAR : Let the great gods , That keep this dreadful pother o 'er our heads , Find out their enemies now . Tremble , thou wretch , That hast within thee undivulged crimes , Unwhipp 'd of justice : hide thee , thou bloody hand ; Thou perjured , and thou simular man of virtue That art incestuous : caitiff , to pieces shake , That under covert and convenient seeming Hast practised on man 's life : close pent-up guilts , Rive your concealing continents , and cry These dreadful summoners grace . I am a man More sinn 'd against than sinning .
KENT : Alack , bare-headed ! Gracious my lord , hard by here is a hovel ; Some friendship will it lend you ' gainst the tempest : Repose you there ; while I to this hard house-- More harder than the stones whereof ' tis raised ; Which even but now , demanding after you , Denied me to come in--return , and force Their scanted courtesy .
KING LEAR : My wits begin to turn . Come on , my boy : how dost , my boy ? art cold ? I am cold myself . Where is this straw , my fellow ? The art of our necessities is strange , That can make vile things precious . Come , your hovel . Poor fool and knave , I have one part in my heart That 's sorry yet for thee .
Fool : He that has and a little tiny wit-- With hey , ho , the wind and the rain , -- Must make content with his fortunes fit , For the rain it raineth every day .
KING LEAR : True , my good boy . Come , bring us to this hovel .
