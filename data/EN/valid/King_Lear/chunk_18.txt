REGAN : Good sir , no more ; these are unsightly tricks : Return you to my sister .
KING LEAR : Never , Regan : She hath abated me of half my train ; Look 'd black upon me ; struck me with her tongue , Most serpent-like , upon the very heart : All the stored vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top ! Strike her young bones , You taking airs , with lameness !
CORNWALL : Fie , sir , fie !
KING LEAR : You nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes ! Infect her beauty , You fen-suck 'd fogs , drawn by the powerful sun , To fall and blast her pride !
REGAN : O the blest gods ! so will you wish on me , When the rash mood is on .
KING LEAR : No , Regan , thou shalt never have my curse : Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give Thee o 'er to harshness : her eyes are fierce ; but thine Do comfort and not burn . ' Tis not in thee To grudge my pleasures , to cut off my train , To bandy hasty words , to scant my sizes , And in conclusion to oppose the bolt Against my coming in : thou better know 'st The offices of nature , bond of childhood , Effects of courtesy , dues of gratitude ; Thy half o ' the kingdom hast thou not forgot , Wherein I thee endow 'd .
REGAN : Good sir , to the purpose .
KING LEAR : Who put my man i ' the stocks ? Tucket within
CORNWALL : What trumpet 's that ?
REGAN : I know 't , my sister 's : this approves her letter , That she would soon be here . Enter OSWALD Is your lady come ?
KING LEAR : This is a slave , whose easy-borrow 'd pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows . Out , varlet , from my sight !
CORNWALL : What means your grace ?
KING LEAR : Who stock 'd my servant ? Regan , I have good hope Thou didst not know on 't . Who comes here ? O heavens , Enter GONERIL If you do love old men , if your sweet sway Allow obedience , if yourselves are old , Make it your cause ; send down , and take my part ! To GONERIL Art not ashamed to look upon this beard ? O Regan , wilt thou take her by the hand ?
GONERIL : Why not by the hand , sir ? How have I offended ? All 's not offence that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so .
KING LEAR : O sides , you are too tough ; Will you yet hold ? How came my man i ' the stocks ?
CORNWALL : I set him there , sir : but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement .
KING LEAR : You ! did you ?
REGAN : I pray you , father , being weak , seem so . If , till the expiration of your month , You will return and sojourn with my sister , Dismissing half your train , come then to me : I am now from home , and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment .
KING LEAR : Return to her , and fifty men dismiss 'd ? No , rather I abjure all roofs , and choose To wage against the enmity o ' the air ; To be a comrade with the wolf and owl , -- Necessity 's sharp pinch ! Return with her ? Why , the hot-blooded France , that dowerless took Our youngest born , I could as well be brought To knee his throne , and , squire-like ; pension beg To keep base life afoot . Return with her ? Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom . Pointing at OSWALD
GONERIL : At your choice , sir .
