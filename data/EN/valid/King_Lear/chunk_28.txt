First Servant : O , I am slain ! My lord , you have one eye left To see some mischief on him . O ! Dies
CORNWALL : Lest it see more , prevent it . Out , vile jelly ! Where is thy lustre now ?
GLOUCESTER : All dark and comfortless . Where 's my son Edmund ? Edmund , enkindle all the sparks of nature , To quit this horrid act .
REGAN : Out , treacherous villain ! Thou call 'st on him that hates thee : it was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us ; Who is too good to pity thee .
GLOUCESTER : O my follies ! then Edgar was abused . Kind gods , forgive me that , and prosper him !
REGAN : Go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell His way to Dover . Exit one with GLOUCESTER How is 't , my lord ? how look you ?
CORNWALL : I have received a hurt : follow me , lady . Turn out that eyeless villain ; throw this slave Upon the dunghill . Regan , I bleed apace : Untimely comes this hurt : give me your arm . Exit CORNWALL , led by REGAN
Second Servant : I 'll never care what wickedness I do , If this man come to good .
Third Servant : If she live long , And in the end meet the old course of death , Women will all turn monsters .
Second Servant : Let 's follow the old earl , and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would : his roguish madness Allows itself to any thing .
Third Servant : Go thou : I 'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face . Now , heaven help him ! Enter EDGAR
EDGAR : Yet better thus , and known to be contemn 'd , Than still contemn 'd and flatter 'd . To be worst , The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune , Stands still in esperance , lives not in fear : The lamentable change is from the best ; The worst returns to laughter . Welcome , then , Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace ! The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst Owes nothing to thy blasts . But who comes here ? Enter GLOUCESTER , led by an Old Man My father , poorly led ? World , world , O world ! But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , Lie would not yield to age .
Old Man : O , my good lord , I have been your tenant , and your father 's tenant , these fourscore years .
GLOUCESTER : Away , get thee away ; good friend , be gone : Thy comforts can do me no good at all ; Thee they may hurt .
Old Man : Alack , sir , you cannot see your way .
GLOUCESTER : I have no way , and therefore want no eyes ; I stumbled when I saw : full oft ' tis seen , Our means secure us , and our mere defects Prove our commodities . O dear son Edgar , The food of thy abused father 's wrath ! Might I but live to see thee in my touch , I 'ld say I had eyes again !
Old Man : How now ! Who 's there ?
EDGAR : O gods ! Who is 't can say ' I am at the worst ' ? I am worse than e 'er I was .
Old Man : ' Tis poor mad Tom .
EDGAR : And worse I may be yet : the worst is not So long as we can say ' This is the worst . ' 
Old Man : Fellow , where goest ?
GLOUCESTER : Is it a beggar-man ?
Old Man : Madman and beggar too .
GLOUCESTER : He has some reason , else he could not beg . I ' the last night 's storm I such a fellow saw ; Which made me think a man a worm : my son Came then into my mind ; and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him : I have heard more since . As flies to wanton boys , are we to the gods . They kill us for their sport .
