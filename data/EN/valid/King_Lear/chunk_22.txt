GLOUCESTER : Alack , alack , Edmund , I like not this unnatural dealing . When I desire their leave that I might pity him , they took from me the use of mine own house ; charged me , on pain of their perpetual displeasure , neither to speak of him , entreat for him , nor any way sustain him .
EDMUND : Most savage and unnatural !
GLOUCESTER : Go to ; say you nothing . There 's a division betwixt the dukes ; and a worse matter than that : I have received a letter this night ; ' tis dangerous to be spoken ; I have locked the letter in my closet : these injuries the king now bears will be revenged home ; there 's part of a power already footed : we must incline to the king . I will seek him , and privily relieve him : go you and maintain talk with the duke , that my charity be not of him perceived : if he ask for me . I am ill , and gone to bed . Though I die for it , as no less is threatened me , the king my old master must be relieved . There is some strange thing toward , Edmund ; pray you , be careful . Exit
EDMUND : This courtesy , forbid thee , shall the duke Instantly know ; and of that letter too : This seems a fair deserving , and must draw me That which my father loses ; no less than all : The younger rises when the old doth fall . Exit Enter KING LEAR , KENT , and Fool
KENT : Here is the place , my lord ; good my lord , enter : The tyranny of the open night 's too rough For nature to endure . Storm still
KING LEAR : Let me alone .
KENT : Good my lord , enter here .
KING LEAR : Wilt break my heart ?
KENT : I had rather break mine own . Good my lord , enter .
KING LEAR : Thou think 'st ' tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin : so ' tis to thee ; But where the greater malady is fix 'd , The lesser is scarce felt . Thou 'ldst shun a bear ; But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea , Thou 'ldst meet the bear i ' the mouth . When the mind 's free , The body 's delicate : the tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there . Filial ingratitude ! Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to 't ? But I will punish home : No , I will weep no more . In such a night To shut me out ! Pour on ; I will endure . In such a night as this ! O Regan , Goneril ! Your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all , -- O , that way madness lies ; let me shun that ; No more of that .
KENT : Good my lord , enter here .
KING LEAR : Prithee , go in thyself : seek thine own ease : This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more . But I 'll go in . To the Fool In , boy ; go first . You houseless poverty , -- Nay , get thee in . I 'll pray , and then I 'll sleep . Fool goes in Poor naked wretches , whereso 'er you are , That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm , How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides , Your loop 'd and window 'd raggedness , defend you From seasons such as these ? O , I have ta 'en Too little care of this ! Take physic , pomp ; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , That thou mayst shake the superflux to them , And show the heavens more just .
EDGAR : Fathom and half , fathom and half ! Poor Tom ! The Fool runs out from the hovel
Fool : Come not in here , nuncle , here 's a spirit Help me , help me !
KENT : Give me thy hand . Who 's there ?
