REGAN : Not altogether so : I look 'd not for you yet , nor am provided For your fit welcome . Give ear , sir , to my sister ; For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old , and so-- But she knows what she does .
KING LEAR : Is this well spoken ?
REGAN : I dare avouch it , sir : what , fifty followers ? Is it not well ? What should you need of more ? Yea , or so many , sith that both charge and danger Speak ' gainst so great a number ? How , in one house , Should many people , under two commands , Hold amity ? ' Tis hard ; almost impossible .
GONERIL : Why might not you , my lord , receive attendance From those that she calls servants or from mine ?
REGAN : Why not , my lord ? If then they chanced to slack you , We could control them . If you will come to me , -- For now I spy a danger , --I entreat you To bring but five and twenty : to no more Will I give place or notice .
KING LEAR : I gave you all--
REGAN : And in good time you gave it .
KING LEAR : Made you my guardians , my depositaries ; But kept a reservation to be follow 'd With such a number . What , must I come to you With five and twenty , Regan ? said you so ?
REGAN : And speak 't again , my lord ; no more with me .
KING LEAR : Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour 'd , When others are more wicked : not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise . To GONERIL I 'll go with thee : Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty , And thou art twice her love .
GONERIL : Hear me , my lord ; What need you five and twenty , ten , or five , To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you ?
REGAN : What need one ?
KING LEAR : O , reason not the need : our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous : Allow not nature more than nature needs , Man 's life 's as cheap as beast 's : thou art a lady ; If only to go warm were gorgeous , Why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear 'st , Which scarcely keeps thee warm . But , for true need , -- You heavens , give me that patience , patience I need ! You see me here , you gods , a poor old man , As full of grief as age ; wretched in both ! If it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts Against their father , fool me not so much To bear it tamely ; touch me with noble anger , And let not women 's weapons , water-drops , Stain my man 's cheeks ! No , you unnatural hags , I will have such revenges on you both , That all the world shall--I will do such things , -- What they are , yet I know not : but they shall be The terrors of the earth . You think I 'll weep No , I 'll not weep : I have full cause of weeping ; but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , Or ere I 'll weep . O fool , I shall go mad ! Storm and tempest
CORNWALL : Let us withdraw ; ' twill be a storm .
REGAN : This house is little : the old man and his people Cannot be well bestow 'd .
GONERIL : ' Tis his own blame ; hath put himself from rest , And must needs taste his folly .
REGAN : For his particular , I 'll receive him gladly , But not one follower .
GONERIL : So am I purposed . Where is my lord of Gloucester ?
CORNWALL : Follow 'd the old man forth : he is return 'd . Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER : The king is in high rage .
CORNWALL : Whither is he going ?
GLOUCESTER : He calls to horse ; but will I know not whither .
