KING LEAR : Darkness and devils ! Saddle my horses ; call my train together : Degenerate bastard ! I 'll not trouble thee . Yet have I left a daughter .
GONERIL : You strike my people ; and your disorder 'd rabble Make servants of their betters . Enter ALBANY
KING LEAR : Woe , that too late repents , -- To ALBANY O , sir , are you come ? Is it your will ? Speak , sir . Prepare my horses . Ingratitude , thou marble-hearted fiend , More hideous when thou show 'st thee in a child Than the sea-monster !
ALBANY : Pray , sir , be patient .
KING LEAR : Detested kite ! thou liest . My train are men of choice and rarest parts , That all particulars of duty know , And in the most exact regard support The worships of their name . O most small fault , How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show ! That , like an engine , wrench 'd my frame of nature From the fix 'd place ; drew from heart all love , And added to the gall . O Lear , Lear , Lear ! Beat at this gate , that let thy folly in , Striking his head And thy dear judgment out ! Go , go , my people .
ALBANY : My lord , I am guiltless , as I am ignorant Of what hath moved you .
KING LEAR : It may be so , my lord . Hear , nature , hear ; dear goddess , hear ! Suspend thy purpose , if thou didst intend To make this creature fruitful ! Into her womb convey sterility ! Dry up in her the organs of increase ; And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honour her ! If she must teem , Create her child of spleen ; that it may live , And be a thwart disnatured torment to her ! Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth ; With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks ; Turn all her mother 's pains and benefits To laughter and contempt ; that she may feel How sharper than a serpent 's tooth it is To have a thankless child ! Away , away ! Exit
ALBANY : Now , gods that we adore , whereof comes this ?
GONERIL : Never afflict yourself to know the cause ; But let his disposition have that scope That dotage gives it . Re-enter KING LEAR
KING LEAR : What , fifty of my followers at a clap ! Within a fortnight !
ALBANY : What 's the matter , sir ?
KING LEAR : I 'll tell thee : To GONERIL Life and death ! I am ashamed That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus ; That these hot tears , which break from me perforce , Should make thee worth them . Blasts and fogs upon thee ! The untented woundings of a father 's curse Pierce every sense about thee ! Old fond eyes , Beweep this cause again , I 'll pluck ye out , And cast you , with the waters that you lose , To temper clay . Yea , it is come to this ? Let is be so : yet have I left a daughter , Who , I am sure , is kind and comfortable : When she shall hear this of thee , with her nails She 'll flay thy wolvish visage . Thou shalt find That I 'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever : thou shalt , I warrant thee .
GONERIL : Do you mark that , my lord ?
ALBANY : I cannot be so partial , Goneril , To the great love I bear you , --
GONERIL : Pray you , content . What , Oswald , ho ! To the Fool You , sir , more knave than fool , after your master .
Fool : Nuncle Lear , nuncle Lear , tarry and take the fool with thee . A fox , when one has caught her , And such a daughter , Should sure to the slaughter , If my cap would buy a halter : So the fool follows after . Exit
