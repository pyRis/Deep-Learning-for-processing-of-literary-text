OSWALD : My lord of Gloucester hath convey 'd him hence : Some five or six and thirty of his knights , Hot questrists after him , met him at gate ; Who , with some other of the lords dependants , Are gone with him towards Dover ; where they boast To have well-armed friends .
CORNWALL : Get horses for your mistress .
GONERIL : Farewell , sweet lord , and sister .
CORNWALL : Edmund , farewell . Go seek the traitor Gloucester , Pinion him like a thief , bring him before us . Though well we may not pass upon his life Without the form of justice , yet our power Shall do a courtesy to our wrath , which men May blame , but not control . Who 's there ? the traitor ? Enter GLOUCESTER , brought in by two or three
REGAN : Ingrateful fox ! ' tis he .
CORNWALL : Bind fast his corky arms .
GLOUCESTER : What mean your graces ? Good my friends , consider You are my guests : do me no foul play , friends .
CORNWALL : Bind him , I say . Servants bind him
REGAN : Hard , hard . O filthy traitor !
GLOUCESTER : Unmerciful lady as you are , I 'm none .
CORNWALL : To this chair bind him . Villain , thou shalt find-- REGAN plucks his beard
GLOUCESTER : By the kind gods , ' tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard .
REGAN : So white , and such a traitor !
GLOUCESTER : Naughty lady , These hairs , which thou dost ravish from my chin , Will quicken , and accuse thee : I am your host : With robbers ' hands my hospitable favours You should not ruffle thus . What will you do ?
CORNWALL : Come , sir , what letters had you late from France ?
REGAN : Be simple answerer , for we know the truth .
CORNWALL : And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom ?
REGAN : To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king ? Speak .
GLOUCESTER : I have a letter guessingly set down , Which came from one that 's of a neutral heart , And not from one opposed .
CORNWALL : Cunning .
REGAN : And false .
CORNWALL : Where hast thou sent the king ?
GLOUCESTER : To Dover .
REGAN : Wherefore to Dover ? Wast thou not charged at peril--
CORNWALL : Wherefore to Dover ? Let him first answer that .
GLOUCESTER : I am tied to the stake , and I must stand the course .
REGAN : Wherefore to Dover , sir ?
GLOUCESTER : Because I would not see thy cruel nails Pluck out his poor old eyes ; nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs . The sea , with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endured , would have buoy 'd up , And quench 'd the stelled fires : Yet , poor old heart , he holp the heavens to rain . If wolves had at thy gate howl 'd that stern time , Thou shouldst have said ' Good porter , turn the key , ' All cruels else subscribed : but I shall see The winged vengeance overtake such children .
CORNWALL : See 't shalt thou never . Fellows , hold the chair . Upon these eyes of thine I 'll set my foot .
GLOUCESTER : He that will think to live till he be old , Give me some help ! O cruel ! O you gods !
REGAN : One side will mock another ; the other too .
CORNWALL : If you see vengeance , --
First Servant : Hold your hand , my lord : I have served you ever since I was a child ; But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold .
REGAN : How now , you dog !
First Servant : If you did wear a beard upon your chin , I 'd shake it on this quarrel . What do you mean ?
CORNWALL : My villain ! They draw and fight
First Servant : Nay , then , come on , and take the chance of anger .
