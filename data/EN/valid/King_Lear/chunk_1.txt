CORDELIA : Then poor Cordelia ! And yet not so ; since , I am sure , my love 's More richer than my tongue .
KING LEAR : To thee and thine hereditary ever Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom ; No less in space , validity , and pleasure , Than that conferr 'd on Goneril . Now , our joy , Although the last , not least ; to whose young love The vines of France and milk of Burgundy Strive to be interess 'd ; what can you say to draw A third more opulent than your sisters ? Speak .
CORDELIA : Nothing , my lord .
KING LEAR : Nothing !
CORDELIA : Nothing .
KING LEAR : Nothing will come of nothing : speak again .
CORDELIA : Unhappy that I am , I cannot heave My heart into my mouth : I love your majesty According to my bond ; nor more nor less .
KING LEAR : How , how , Cordelia ! mend your speech a little , Lest it may mar your fortunes .
CORDELIA : Good my lord , You have begot me , bred me , loved me : I Return those duties back as are right fit , Obey you , love you , and most honour you . Why have my sisters husbands , if they say They love you all ? Haply , when I shall wed , That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him , half my care and duty : Sure , I shall never marry like my sisters , To love my father all .
KING LEAR : But goes thy heart with this ?
CORDELIA : Ay , good my lord .
KING LEAR : So young , and so untender ?
CORDELIA : So young , my lord , and true .
KING LEAR : Let it be so ; thy truth , then , be thy dower : For , by the sacred radiance of the sun , The mysteries of Hecate , and the night ; By all the operation of the orbs From whom we do exist , and cease to be ; Here I disclaim all my paternal care , Propinquity and property of blood , And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee , from this , for ever . The barbarous Scythian , Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite , shall to my bosom Be as well neighbour 'd , pitied , and relieved , As thou my sometime daughter .
KENT : Good my liege , --
KING LEAR : Peace , Kent ! Come not between the dragon and his wrath . I loved her most , and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery . Hence , and avoid my sight ! So be my grave my peace , as here I give Her father 's heart from her ! Call France ; who stirs ? Call Burgundy . Cornwall and Albany , With my two daughters ' dowers digest this third : Let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her . I do invest you jointly with my power , Pre-eminence , and all the large effects That troop with majesty . Ourself , by monthly course , With reservation of an hundred knights , By you to be sustain 'd , shall our abode Make with you by due turns . Only we still retain The name , and all the additions to a king ; The sway , revenue , execution of the rest , Beloved sons , be yours : which to confirm , This coronet part betwixt you . Giving the crown
KENT : Royal Lear , Whom I have ever honour 'd as my king , Loved as my father , as my master follow 'd , As my great patron thought on in my prayers , --
KING LEAR : The bow is bent and drawn , make from the shaft .
