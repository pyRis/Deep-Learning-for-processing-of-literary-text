GONERIL : Not so hot : In his own grace he doth exalt himself , More than in your addition .
REGAN : In my rights , By me invested , he compeers the best .
GONERIL : That were the most , if he should husband you .
REGAN : Jesters do oft prove prophets .
GONERIL : Holla , holla ! That eye that told you so look 'd but a-squint .
REGAN : Lady , I am not well ; else I should answer From a full-flowing stomach . General , Take thou my soldiers , prisoners , patrimony ; Dispose of them , of me ; the walls are thine : Witness the world , that I create thee here My lord and master .
GONERIL : Mean you to enjoy him ?
ALBANY : The let-alone lies not in your good will .
EDMUND : Nor in thine , lord .
ALBANY : Half-blooded fellow , yes .
REGAN : Let the drum strike , and prove my title thine .
ALBANY : Stay yet ; hear reason . Edmund , I arrest thee On capital treason ; and , in thine attaint , This gilded serpent Pointing to Goneril For your claim , fair sister , I bar it in the interest of my wife : ' Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord , And I , her husband , contradict your bans . If you will marry , make your loves to me , My lady is bespoke .
GONERIL : An interlude !
ALBANY : Thou art arm 'd , Gloucester : let the trumpet sound : If none appear to prove upon thy head Thy heinous , manifest , and many treasons , There is my pledge ; Throwing down a glove I 'll prove it on thy heart , Ere I taste bread , thou art in nothing less Than I have here proclaim 'd thee .
REGAN : Sick , O , sick !
GONERIL : If not , I 'll ne 'er trust medicine .
EDMUND : There 's my exchange : Throwing down a glove what in the world he is That names me traitor , villain-like he lies : Call by thy trumpet : he that dares approach , On him , on you , who not ? I will maintain My truth and honour firmly .
ALBANY : A herald , ho !
EDMUND : A herald , ho , a herald !
ALBANY : Trust to thy single virtue ; for thy soldiers , All levied in my name , have in my name Took their discharge .
REGAN : My sickness grows upon me .
ALBANY : She is not well ; convey her to my tent . Exit Regan , led Enter a Herald Come hither , herald , --Let the trumpet sound , And read out this .
Captain : Sound , trumpet ! A trumpet sounds
Herald : ' If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund , supposed Earl of Gloucester , that he is a manifold traitor , let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet : he is bold in his defence . ' 
EDMUND : Sound ! First trumpet
Herald : Again ! Second trumpet
Herald : Again ! Third trumpet Trumpet answers within Enter EDGAR , at the third sound , armed , with a trumpet before him
ALBANY : Ask him his purposes , why he appears Upon this call o ' the trumpet .
Herald : What are you ? Your name , your quality ? and why you answer This present summons ?
EDGAR : Know , my name is lost ; By treason 's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit : Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope .
ALBANY : Which is that adversary ?
EDGAR : What 's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester ?
EDMUND : Himself : what say 'st thou to him ?
