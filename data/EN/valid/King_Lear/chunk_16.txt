KING LEAR : ' Tis strange that they should so depart from home , And not send back my messenger .
Gentleman : As I learn 'd , The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove .
KENT : Hail to thee , noble master !
KING LEAR : Ha ! Makest thou this shame thy pastime ?
KENT : No , my lord .
Fool : Ha , ha ! he wears cruel garters . Horses are tied by the heads , dogs and bears by the neck , monkeys by the loins , and men by the legs : when a man 's over-lusty at legs , then he wears wooden nether-stocks .
KING LEAR : What 's he that hath so much thy place mistook To set thee here ?
KENT : It is both he and she ; Your son and daughter .
KING LEAR : No .
KENT : Yes .
KING LEAR : No , I say .
KENT : I say , yea .
KING LEAR : No , no , they would not .
KENT : Yes , they have .
KING LEAR : By Jupiter , I swear , no .
KENT : By Juno , I swear , ay .
KING LEAR : They durst not do ' t ; They could not , would not do ' t ; ' tis worse than murder , To do upon respect such violent outrage : Resolve me , with all modest haste , which way Thou mightst deserve , or they impose , this usage , Coming from us .
KENT : My lord , when at their home I did commend your highness ' letters to them , Ere I was risen from the place that show 'd My duty kneeling , came there a reeking post , Stew 'd in his haste , half breathless , panting forth From Goneril his mistress salutations ; Deliver 'd letters , spite of intermission , Which presently they read : on whose contents , They summon 'd up their meiny , straight took horse ; Commanded me to follow , and attend The leisure of their answer ; gave me cold looks : And meeting here the other messenger , Whose welcome , I perceived , had poison 'd mine , -- Being the very fellow that of late Display 'd so saucily against your highness , -- Having more man than wit about me , drew : He raised the house with loud and coward cries . Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers .
Fool : Winter 's not gone yet , if the wild-geese fly that way . Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind ; But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind . Fortune , that arrant whore , Ne 'er turns the key to the poor . But , for all this , thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year .
KING LEAR : O , how this mother swells up toward my heart ! Hysterica passio , down , thou climbing sorrow , Thy element 's below ! Where is this daughter ?
KENT : With the earl , sir , here within .
KING LEAR : Follow me not ; Stay here . Exit
Gentleman : Made you no more offence but what you speak of ?
KENT : None . How chance the king comes with so small a train ?
Fool : And thou hadst been set i ' the stocks for that question , thou hadst well deserved it .
KENT : Why , fool ?
