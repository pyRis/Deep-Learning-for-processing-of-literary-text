KING LEAR : Do you bandy looks with me , you rascal ? Striking him
OSWALD : I 'll not be struck , my lord .
KENT : Nor tripped neither , you base football player . Tripping up his heels
KING LEAR : I thank thee , fellow ; thou servest me , and I 'll love thee .
KENT : Come , sir , arise , away ! I 'll teach you differences : away , away ! if you will measure your lubber 's length again , tarry : but away ! go to ; have you wisdom ? so . Pushes OSWALD out
KING LEAR : Now , my friendly knave , I thank thee : there 's earnest of thy service . Giving KENT money Enter Fool
Fool : Let me hire him too : here 's my coxcomb . Offering KENT his cap
KING LEAR : How now , my pretty knave ! how dost thou ?
Fool : Sirrah , you were best take my coxcomb .
KENT : Why , fool ?
Fool : Why , for taking one 's part that 's out of favour : nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , thou 'lt catch cold shortly : there , take my coxcomb : why , this fellow has banished two on 's daughters , and did the third a blessing against his will ; if thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb . How now , nuncle ! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters !
KING LEAR : Why , my boy ?
Fool : If I gave them all my living , I 'ld keep my coxcombs myself . There 's mine ; beg another of thy daughters .
KING LEAR : Take heed , sirrah ; the whip .
Fool : Truth 's a dog must to kennel ; he must be whipped out , when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink .
KING LEAR : A pestilent gall to me !
Fool : Sirrah , I 'll teach thee a speech .
KING LEAR : Do .
Fool : Mark it , nuncle : Have more than thou showest , Speak less than thou knowest , Lend less than thou owest , Ride more than thou goest , Learn more than thou trowest , Set less than thou throwest ; Leave thy drink and thy whore , And keep in-a-door , And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score .
KENT : This is nothing , fool .
Fool : Then ' tis like the breath of an unfee 'd lawyer ; you gave me nothing for 't . Can you make no use of nothing , nuncle ?
KING LEAR : Why , no , boy ; nothing can be made out of nothing .
Fool : Prithee , tell him , so much the rent of his land comes to : he will not believe a fool .
KING LEAR : A bitter fool !
Fool : Dost thou know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet fool ?
KING LEAR : No , lad ; teach me .
Fool : That lord that counsell 'd thee To give away thy land , Come place him here by me , Do thou for him stand : The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear ; The one in motley here , The other found out there .
KING LEAR : Dost thou call me fool , boy ?
Fool : All thy other titles thou hast given away ; that thou wast born with .
KENT : This is not altogether fool , my lord .
Fool : No , faith , lords and great men will not let me ; if I had a monopoly out , they would have part on 't : and ladies too , they will not let me have all fool to myself ; they 'll be snatching . Give me an egg , nuncle , and I 'll give thee two crowns .
KING LEAR : What two crowns shall they be ?
