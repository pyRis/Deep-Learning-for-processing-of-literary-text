GLOUCESTER : Is that the naked fellow ?
Old Man : Ay , my lord .
GLOUCESTER : Then , prithee , get thee gone : if , for my sake , Thou wilt o 'ertake us , hence a mile or twain , I ' the way toward Dover , do it for ancient love ; And bring some covering for this naked soul , Who I 'll entreat to lead me .
Old Man : Alack , sir , he is mad .
GLOUCESTER : ' Tis the times ' plague , when madmen lead the blind . Do as I bid thee , or rather do thy pleasure ; Above the rest , be gone .
Old Man : I 'll bring him the best ' parel that I have , Come on 't what will . Exit
GLOUCESTER : Sirrah , naked fellow , --
EDGAR : Poor Tom 's a-cold . Aside I cannot daub it further .
GLOUCESTER : Come hither , fellow .
EDGAR : And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes , they bleed .
GLOUCESTER : Know 'st thou the way to Dover ?
EDGAR : Both stile and gate , horse-way and foot-path . Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits : bless thee , good man 's son , from the foul fiend ! five fiends have been in poor Tom at once ; of lust , as Obidicut ; Hobbididence , prince of dumbness ; Mahu , of stealing ; Modo , of murder ; Flibbertigibbet , of mopping and mowing , who since possesses chambermaids and waiting-women . So , bless thee , master !
GLOUCESTER : Here , take this purse , thou whom the heavens ' plagues Have humbled to all strokes : that I am wretched Makes thee the happier : heavens , deal so still ! Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man , That slaves your ordinance , that will not see Because he doth not feel , feel your power quickly ; So distribution should undo excess , And each man have enough . Dost thou know Dover ?
EDGAR : Ay , master .
GLOUCESTER : There is a cliff , whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confined deep : Bring me but to the very brim of it , And I 'll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me : from that place I shall no leading need .
EDGAR : Give me thy arm : Poor Tom shall lead thee . Enter GONERIL and EDMUND
GONERIL : Welcome , my lord : I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way . Enter OSWALD Now , where 's your master ' ?
OSWALD : Madam , within ; but never man so changed . I told him of the army that was landed ; He smiled at it : I told him you were coming : His answer was ' The worse : ' of Gloucester 's treachery , And of the loyal service of his son , When I inform 'd him , then he call 'd me sot , And told me I had turn 'd the wrong side out : What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him ; What like , offensive .
GONERIL : Then shall you go no further . It is the cowish terror of his spirit , That dares not undertake : he 'll not feel wrongs Which tie him to an answer . Our wishes on the way May prove effects . Back , Edmund , to my brother ; Hasten his musters and conduct his powers : I must change arms at home , and give the distaff Into my husband 's hands . This trusty servant Shall pass between us : ere long you are like to hear , If you dare venture in your own behalf , A mistress 's command . Wear this ; spare speech ; Giving a favour Decline your head : this kiss , if it durst speak , Would stretch thy spirits up into the air : Conceive , and fare thee well .
EDMUND : Yours in the ranks of death .
GONERIL : My most dear Gloucester ! Exit EDMUND O , the difference of man and man ! To thee a woman 's services are due : My fool usurps my body .
OSWALD : Madam , here comes my lord . Exit Enter ALBANY
GONERIL : I have been worth the whistle .
