EDGAR : Why I do trifle thus with his despair Is done to cure it .
GLOUCESTER : O you mighty gods ! This world I do renounce , and , in your sights , Shake patiently my great affliction off : If I could bear it longer , and not fall To quarrel with your great opposeless wills , My snuff and loathed part of nature should Burn itself out . If Edgar live , O , bless him ! Now , fellow , fare thee well . He falls forward
EDGAR : Gone , sir : farewell . And yet I know not how conceit may rob The treasury of life , when life itself Yields to the theft : had he been where he thought , By this , had thought been past . Alive or dead ? Ho , you sir ! friend ! Hear you , sir ! speak ! Thus might he pass indeed : yet he revives . What are you , sir ?
GLOUCESTER : Away , and let me die .
EDGAR : Hadst thou been aught but gossamer , feathers , air , So many fathom down precipitating , Thou 'dst shiver 'd like an egg : but thou dost breathe ; Hast heavy substance ; bleed 'st not ; speak 'st ; art sound . Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell : Thy life 's a miracle . Speak yet again .
GLOUCESTER : But have I fall 'n , or no ?
EDGAR : From the dread summit of this chalky bourn . Look up a-height ; the shrill-gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard : do but look up .
GLOUCESTER : Alack , I have no eyes . Is wretchedness deprived that benefit , To end itself by death ? ' Twas yet some comfort , When misery could beguile the tyrant 's rage , And frustrate his proud will .
EDGAR : Give me your arm : Up : so . How is ' t ? Feel you your legs ? You stand .
GLOUCESTER : Too well , too well .
EDGAR : This is above all strangeness . Upon the crown o ' the cliff , what thing was that Which parted from you ?
GLOUCESTER : A poor unfortunate beggar .
EDGAR : As I stood here below , methought his eyes Were two full moons ; he had a thousand noses , Horns whelk 'd and waved like the enridged sea : It was some fiend ; therefore , thou happy father , Think that the clearest gods , who make them honours Of men 's impossibilities , have preserved thee .
GLOUCESTER : I do remember now : henceforth I 'll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself ' Enough , enough , ' and die . That thing you speak of , I took it for a man ; often ' twould say ' The fiend , the fiend : ' he led me to that place .
EDGAR : Bear free and patient thoughts . But who comes here ? Enter KING LEAR , fantastically dressed with wild flowers The safer sense will ne 'er accommodate His master thus .
KING LEAR : No , they cannot touch me for coining ; I am the king himself .
EDGAR : O thou side-piercing sight !
KING LEAR : Nature 's above art in that respect . There 's your press-money . That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper : draw me a clothier 's yard . Look , look , a mouse ! Peace , peace ; this piece of toasted cheese will do ' t . There 's my gauntlet ; I 'll prove it on a giant . Bring up the brown bills . O , well flown , bird ! i ' the clout , i ' the clout : hewgh ! Give the word .
EDGAR : Sweet marjoram .
KING LEAR : Pass .
GLOUCESTER : I know that voice .
