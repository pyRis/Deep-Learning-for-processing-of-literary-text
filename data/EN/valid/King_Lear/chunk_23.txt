KENT : What art thou that dost grumble there i ' the straw ? Come forth . Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man
EDGAR : Away ! the foul fiend follows me ! Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind . Hum ! go to thy cold bed , and warm thee .
KING LEAR : Hast thou given all to thy two daughters ? And art thou come to this ?
EDGAR : Who gives any thing to poor Tom ? whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame , and through ford and whirlipool e 'er bog and quagmire ; that hath laid knives under his pillow , and halters in his pew ; set ratsbane by his porridge ; made film proud of heart , to ride on a bay trotting-horse over four-inched bridges , to course his own shadow for a traitor . Bless thy five wits ! Tom 's a-cold , --O , do de , do de , do de . Bless thee from whirlwinds , star-blasting , and taking ! Do poor Tom some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes : there could I have him now , --and there , --and there again , and there . Storm still
KING LEAR : What , have his daughters brought him to this pass ? Couldst thou save nothing ? Didst thou give them all ?
Fool : Nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
KING LEAR : Now , all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o 'er men 's faults light on thy daughters !
KENT : He hath no daughters , sir .
KING LEAR : Death , traitor ! nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters . Is it the fashion , that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh ? Judicious punishment ! ' twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters .
EDGAR : Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill : Halloo , halloo , loo , loo !
Fool : This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen .
EDGAR : Take heed o ' the foul fiend : obey thy parents ; keep thy word justly ; swear not ; commit not with man 's sworn spouse ; set not thy sweet heart on proud array . Tom 's a-cold .
KING LEAR : What hast thou been ?
EDGAR : A serving-man , proud in heart and mind ; that curled my hair ; wore gloves in my cap ; served the lust of my mistress ' heart , and did the act of darkness with her ; swore as many oaths as I spake words , and broke them in the sweet face of heaven : one that slept in the contriving of lust , and waked to do it : wine loved I deeply , dice dearly : and in woman out-paramoured the Turk : false of heart , light of ear , bloody of hand ; hog in sloth , fox in stealth , wolf in greediness , dog in madness , lion in prey . Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman : keep thy foot out of brothels , thy hand out of plackets , thy pen from lenders ' books , and defy the foul fiend . Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind : Says suum , mun , ha , no , nonny . Dolphin my boy , my boy , sessa ! let him trot by . Storm still
KING LEAR : Why , thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies . Is man no more than this ? Consider him well . Thou owest the worm no silk , the beast no hide , the sheep no wool , the cat no perfume . Ha ! here 's three on ' s are sophisticated ! Thou art the thing itself : unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare , forked animal as thou art . Off , off , you lendings ! come unbutton here . Tearing off his clothes
