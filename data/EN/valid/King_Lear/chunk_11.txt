ALBANY : Well , you may fear too far .
GONERIL : Safer than trust too far : Let me still take away the harms I fear , Not fear still to be taken : I know his heart . What he hath utter 'd I have writ my sister If she sustain him and his hundred knights When I have show 'd the unfitness , -- Re-enter OSWALD How now , Oswald ! What , have you writ that letter to my sister ?
OSWALD : Yes , madam .
GONERIL : Take you some company , and away to horse : Inform her full of my particular fear ; And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more . Get you gone ; And hasten your return . Exit OSWALD No , no , my lord , This milky gentleness and course of yours Though I condemn not , yet , under pardon , You are much more attask 'd for want of wisdom Than praised for harmful mildness .
ALBANY : How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell : Striving to better , oft we mar what 's well .
GONERIL : Nay , then--
ALBANY : Well , well ; the event . Enter KING LEAR , KENT , and Fool
KING LEAR : Go you before to Gloucester with these letters . Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you know than comes from her demand out of the letter . If your diligence be not speedy , I shall be there afore you .
KENT : I will not sleep , my lord , till I have delivered your letter . Exit
Fool : If a man 's brains were in 's heels , were 't not in danger of kibes ?
KING LEAR : Ay , boy .
Fool : Then , I prithee , be merry ; thy wit shall ne 'er go slip-shod .
KING LEAR : Ha , ha , ha !
Fool : Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly ; for though she 's as like this as a crab 's like an apple , yet I can tell what I can tell .
KING LEAR : Why , what canst thou tell , my boy ?
Fool : She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab . Thou canst tell why one 's nose stands i ' the middle on 's face ?
KING LEAR : No .
Fool : Why , to keep one 's eyes of either side 's nose ; that what a man cannot smell out , he may spy into .
KING LEAR : I did her wrong--
Fool : Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell ?
KING LEAR : No .
Fool : Nor I neither ; but I can tell why a snail has a house .
KING LEAR : Why ?
Fool : Why , to put his head in ; not to give it away to his daughters , and leave his horns without a case .
KING LEAR : I will forget my nature . So kind a father ! Be my horses ready ?
Fool : Thy asses are gone about ' em . The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason .
KING LEAR : Because they are not eight ?
Fool : Yes , indeed : thou wouldst make a good fool .
KING LEAR : To take ' t again perforce ! Monster ingratitude !
Fool : If thou wert my fool , nuncle , I 'ld have thee beaten for being old before thy time .
KING LEAR : How 's that ?
Fool : Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise .
KING LEAR : O , let me not be mad , not mad , sweet heaven Keep me in temper : I would not be mad ! Enter Gentleman How now ! are the horses ready ?
Gentleman : Ready , my lord .
KING LEAR : Come , boy .
Fool : She that 's a maid now , and laughs at my departure , Shall not be a maid long , unless things be cut shorter . Enter EDMUND , and CURAN meets him
EDMUND : Save thee , Curan .
