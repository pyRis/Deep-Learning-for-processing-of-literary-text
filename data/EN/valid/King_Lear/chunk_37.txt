Doctor : Madam , do you ; ' tis fittest .
CORDELIA : How does my royal lord ? How fares your majesty ?
KING LEAR : You do me wrong to take me out o ' the grave : Thou art a soul in bliss ; but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears Do scald like moulten lead .
CORDELIA : Sir , do you know me ?
KING LEAR : You are a spirit , I know : when did you die ?
CORDELIA : Still , still , far wide !
Doctor : He 's scarce awake : let him alone awhile .
KING LEAR : Where have I been ? Where am I ? Fair daylight ? I am mightily abused . I should e 'en die with pity , To see another thus . I know not what to say . I will not swear these are my hands : let 's see ; I feel this pin prick . Would I were assured Of my condition !
CORDELIA : O , look upon me , sir , And hold your hands in benediction o 'er me : No , sir , you must not kneel .
KING LEAR : Pray , do not mock me : I am a very foolish fond old man , Fourscore and upward , not an hour more nor less ; And , to deal plainly , I fear I am not in my perfect mind . Methinks I should know you , and know this man ; Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant What place this is ; and all the skill I have Remembers not these garments ; nor I know not Where I did lodge last night . Do not laugh at me ; For , as I am a man , I think this lady To be my child Cordelia .
CORDELIA : And so I am , I am .
KING LEAR : Be your tears wet ? yes , ' faith . I pray , weep not : If you have poison for me , I will drink it . I know you do not love me ; for your sisters Have , as I do remember , done me wrong : You have some cause , they have not .
CORDELIA : No cause , no cause .
KING LEAR : Am I in France ?
KENT : In your own kingdom , sir .
KING LEAR : Do not abuse me .
Doctor : Be comforted , good madam : the great rage , You see , is kill 'd in him : and yet it is danger To make him even o 'er the time he has lost . Desire him to go in ; trouble him no more Till further settling .
CORDELIA : Will 't please your highness walk ?
KING LEAR : You must bear with me : Pray you now , forget and forgive : I am old and foolish .
Gentleman : Holds it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain ?
KENT : Most certain , sir .
Gentleman : Who is conductor of his people ?
KENT : As ' tis said , the bastard son of Gloucester .
Gentleman : They say Edgar , his banished son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
KENT : Report is changeable . ' Tis time to look about ; the powers of the kingdom approach apace .
Gentleman : The arbitrement is like to be bloody . Fare you well , sir . Exit
KENT : My point and period will be throughly wrought , Or well or ill , as this day 's battle 's fought . Exit Enter , with drum and colours , EDMUND , REGAN , Gentlemen , and Soldiers .
EDMUND : Know of the duke if his last purpose hold , Or whether since he is advised by aught To change the course : he 's full of alteration And self-reproving : bring his constant pleasure . To a Gentleman , who goes out
REGAN : Our sister 's man is certainly miscarried .
EDMUND : ' Tis to be doubted , madam .
REGAN : Now , sweet lord , You know the goodness I intend upon you : Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth , Do you not love my sister ?
EDMUND : In honour 'd love .
