CORNWALL : I now perceive , it was not altogether your brother 's evil disposition made him seek his death ; but a provoking merit , set a-work by a reprovable badness in himself .
EDMUND : How malicious is my fortune , that I must repent to be just ! This is the letter he spoke of , which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France : O heavens ! that this treason were not , or not I the detector !
CORNWALL : o with me to the duchess .
EDMUND : If the matter of this paper be certain , you have mighty business in hand .
CORNWALL : True or false , it hath made thee earl of Gloucester . Seek out where thy father is , that he may be ready for our apprehension .
EDMUND : If I find him comforting the king , it will stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in my course of loyalty , though the conflict be sore between that and my blood .
CORNWALL : I will lay trust upon thee ; and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love . Enter GLOUCESTER , KING LEAR , KENT , Fool , and EDGAR
GLOUCESTER : Here is better than the open air ; take it thankfully . I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can : I will not be long from you .
KENT : All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience : the gods reward your kindness ! Exit GLOUCESTER
EDGAR : Frateretto calls me ; and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness . Pray , innocent , and beware the foul fiend .
Fool : Prithee , nuncle , tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman ?
KING LEAR : A king , a king !
Fool : No , he 's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son ; for he 's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him .
KING LEAR : To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hissing in upon ' em , --
EDGAR : The foul fiend bites my back .
Fool : He 's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf , a horse 's health , a boy 's love , or a whore 's oath .
KING LEAR : It shall be done ; I will arraign them straight . To EDGAR Come , sit thou here , most learned justicer ; To the Fool Thou , sapient sir , sit here . Now , you she foxes !
EDGAR : Look , where he stands and glares ! Wantest thou eyes at trial , madam ? Come o 'er the bourn , Bessy , to me , --
Fool : Her boat hath a leak , And she must not speak Why she dares not come over to thee .
EDGAR : The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale . Hopdance cries in Tom 's belly for two white herring . Croak not , black angel ; I have no food for thee .
KENT : How do you , sir ? Stand you not so amazed : Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions ?
KING LEAR : I 'll see their trial first . Bring in the evidence . To EDGAR Thou robed man of justice , take thy place ; To the Fool And thou , his yoke-fellow of equity , Bench by his side : To KENT you are o ' the commission , Sit you too .
EDGAR : Let us deal justly . Sleepest or wakest thou , jolly shepherd ? Thy sheep be in the corn ; And for one blast of thy minikin mouth , Thy sheep shall take no harm . Pur ! the cat is gray .
KING LEAR : Arraign her first ; ' tis Goneril . I here take my oath before this honourable assembly , she kicked the poor king her father .
Fool : Come hither , mistress . Is your name Goneril ?
KING LEAR : She cannot deny it .
Fool : Cry you mercy , I took you for a joint-stool .
