EDMUND : I am thinking , brother , of a prediction I read this other day , what should follow these eclipses .
EDGAR : Do you busy yourself about that ?
EDMUND : I promise you , the effects he writes of succeed unhappily ; as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent ; death , dearth , dissolutions of ancient amities ; divisions in state , menaces and maledictions against king and nobles ; needless diffidences , banishment of friends , dissipation of cohorts , nuptial breaches , and I know not what .
EDGAR : How long have you been a sectary astronomical ?
EDMUND : Come , come ; when saw you my father last ?
EDGAR : Why , the night gone by .
EDMUND : Spake you with him ?
EDGAR : Ay , two hours together .
EDMUND : Parted you in good terms ? Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ?
EDGAR : None at all .
EDMUND : Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him : and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure ; which at this instant so rageth in him , that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay .
EDGAR : Some villain hath done me wrong .
EDMUND : That 's my fear . I pray you , have a continent forbearance till the spied of his rage goes slower ; and , as I say , retire with me to my lodging , from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak : pray ye , go ; there 's my key : if you do stir abroad , go armed .
EDGAR : Armed , brother !
EDMUND : Brother , I advise you to the best ; go armed : I am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you : I have told you what I have seen and heard ; but faintly , nothing like the image and horror of it : pray you , away .
EDGAR : Shall I hear from you anon ?
EDMUND : I do serve you in this business . Exit EDGAR A credulous father ! and a brother noble , Whose nature is so far from doing harms , That he suspects none : on whose foolish honesty My practises ride easy ! I see the business . Let me , if not by birth , have lands by wit : All with me 's meet that I can fashion fit . Exit Enter GONERIL , and OSWALD , her steward
GONERIL : Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool ?
OSWALD : Yes , madam .
GONERIL : By day and night he wrongs me ; every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other , That sets us all at odds : I 'll not endure it : His knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us On every trifle . When he returns from hunting , I will not speak with him ; say I am sick : If you come slack of former services , You shall do well ; the fault of it I 'll answer .
OSWALD : He 's coming , madam ; I hear him . Horns within
GONERIL : Put on what weary negligence you please , You and your fellows ; I 'll have it come to question : If he dislike it , let him to our sister , Whose mind and mine , I know , in that are one , Not to be over-ruled . Idle old man , That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away ! Now , by my life , Old fools are babes again ; and must be used With cheques as flatteries , --when they are seen abused . Remember what I tell you .
OSWALD : Well , madam .
GONERIL : And let his knights have colder looks among you ; What grows of it , no matter ; advise your fellows so : I would breed from hence occasions , and I shall , That I may speak : I 'll write straight to my sister , To hold my very course . Prepare for dinner . Enter KENT , disguised
