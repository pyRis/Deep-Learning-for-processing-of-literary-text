EDMUND : In wisdom I should ask thy name ; But , since thy outside looks so fair and warlike , And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes , What safe and nicely I might well delay By rule of knighthood , I disdain and spurn : Back do I toss these treasons to thy head ; With the hell-hated lie o 'erwhelm thy heart ; Which , for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise , This sword of mine shall give them instant way , Where they shall rest for ever . Trumpets , speak ! Alarums . They fight . EDMUND falls
ALBANY : Save him , save him !
GONERIL : This is practise , Gloucester : By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite ; thou art not vanquish 'd , But cozen 'd and beguiled .
ALBANY : Shut your mouth , dame , Or with this paper shall I stop it : Hold , sir : Thou worse than any name , read thine own evil : No tearing , lady : I perceive you know it . Gives the letter to EDMUND
GONERIL : Say , if I do , the laws are mine , not thine : Who can arraign me for 't .
ALBANY : Most monstrous ! oh ! Know 'st thou this paper ?
GONERIL : Ask me not what I know . Exit
ALBANY : Go after her : she 's desperate ; govern her .
EDMUND : What you have charged me with , that have I done ; And more , much more ; the time will bring it out : ' Tis past , and so am I. But what art thou That hast this fortune on me ? If thou 'rt noble , I do forgive thee .
EDGAR : Let 's exchange charity . I am no less in blood than thou art , Edmund ; If more , the more thou hast wrong 'd me . My name is Edgar , and thy father 's son . The gods are just , and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us : The dark and vicious place where thee he got Cost him his eyes .
EDMUND : Thou hast spoken right , ' tis true ; The wheel is come full circle : I am here .
ALBANY : Methought thy very gait did prophesy A royal nobleness : I must embrace thee : Let sorrow split my heart , if ever I Did hate thee or thy father !
EDGAR : Worthy prince , I know 't .
ALBANY : Where have you hid yourself ? How have you known the miseries of your father ?
EDGAR : By nursing them , my lord . List a brief tale ; And when ' tis told , O , that my heart would burst ! The bloody proclamation to escape , That follow 'd me so near , --O , our lives ' sweetness ! That we the pain of death would hourly die Rather than die at once ! --taught me to shift Into a madman 's rags ; to assume a semblance That very dogs disdain 'd : and in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings , Their precious stones new lost : became his guide , Led him , begg 'd for him , saved him from despair ; Never , --O fault ! --reveal 'd myself unto him , Until some half-hour past , when I was arm 'd : Not sure , though hoping , of this good success , I ask 'd his blessing , and from first to last Told him my pilgrimage : but his flaw 'd heart , Alack , too weak the conflict to support ! ' Twixt two extremes of passion , joy and grief , Burst smilingly .
EDMUND : This speech of yours hath moved me , And shall perchance do good : but speak you on ; You look as you had something more to say .
ALBANY : If there be more , more woeful , hold it in ; For I am almost ready to dissolve , Hearing of this .
