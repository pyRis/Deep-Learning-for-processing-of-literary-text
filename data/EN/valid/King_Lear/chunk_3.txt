CORDELIA : I yet beseech your majesty , -- If for I want that glib and oily art , To speak and purpose not ; since what I well intend , I 'll do 't before I speak , --that you make known It is no vicious blot , murder , or foulness , No unchaste action , or dishonour 'd step , That hath deprived me of your grace and favour ; But even for want of that for which I am richer , A still-soliciting eye , and such a tongue As I am glad I have not , though not to have it Hath lost me in your liking .
KING LEAR : Better thou Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better .
KING OF FRANCE : Is it but this , --a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do ? My lord of Burgundy , What say you to the lady ? Love 's not love When it is mingled with regards that stand Aloof from the entire point . Will you have her ? She is herself a dowry .
BURGUNDY : Royal Lear , Give but that portion which yourself proposed , And here I take Cordelia by the hand , Duchess of Burgundy .
KING LEAR : Nothing : I have sworn ; I am firm .
BURGUNDY : I am sorry , then , you have so lost a father That you must lose a husband .
CORDELIA : Peace be with Burgundy ! Since that respects of fortune are his love , I shall not be his wife .
KING OF FRANCE : Fairest Cordelia , that art most rich , being poor ; Most choice , forsaken ; and most loved , despised ! Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon : Be it lawful I take up what 's cast away . Gods , gods ! ' tis strange that from their cold 'st neglect My love should kindle to inflamed respect . Thy dowerless daughter , king , thrown to my chance , Is queen of us , of ours , and our fair France : Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me . Bid them farewell , Cordelia , though unkind : Thou losest here , a better where to find .
KING LEAR : Thou hast her , France : let her be thine ; for we Have no such daughter , nor shall ever see That face of hers again . Therefore be gone Without our grace , our love , our benison . Come , noble Burgundy .
KING OF FRANCE : Bid farewell to your sisters .
CORDELIA : The jewels of our father , with wash 'd eyes Cordelia leaves you : I know you what you are ; And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named . Use well our father : To your professed bosoms I commit him But yet , alas , stood I within his grace , I would prefer him to a better place . So , farewell to you both .
REGAN : Prescribe not us our duties .
GONERIL : Let your study Be to content your lord , who hath received you At fortune 's alms . You have obedience scanted , And well are worth the want that you have wanted .
CORDELIA : Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides : Who cover faults , at last shame them derides . Well may you prosper !
KING OF FRANCE : Come , my fair Cordelia .
GONERIL : Sister , it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both . I think our father will hence to-night .
REGAN : That 's most certain , and with you ; next month with us .
GONERIL : You see how full of changes his age is ; the observation we have made of it hath not been little : he always loved our sister most ; and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly .
REGAN : ' Tis the infirmity of his age : yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
