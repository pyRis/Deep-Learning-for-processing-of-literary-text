KENT : I am come To bid my king and master aye good night : Is he not here ?
ALBANY : Great thing of us forgot ! Speak , Edmund , where 's the king ? and where 's Cordelia ? See 'st thou this object , Kent ? The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in

ALBANY : Run , run , O , run !
EDGAR : To who , my lord ? Who hath the office ? send Thy token of reprieve .
EDMUND : Well thought on : take my sword , Give it the captain .
ALBANY : Haste thee , for thy life . Exit EDGAR
EDMUND : He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison , and To lay the blame upon her own despair , That she fordid herself .
ALBANY : The gods defend her ! Bear him hence awhile . EDMUND is borne off Re-enter KING LEAR , with CORDELIA dead in his arms ; EDGAR , Captain , and others following
KING LEAR : Howl , howl , howl , howl ! O , you are men of stones : Had I your tongues and eyes , I 'ld use them so That heaven 's vault should crack . She 's gone for ever ! I know when one is dead , and when one lives ; She 's dead as earth . Lend me a looking-glass ; If that her breath will mist or stain the stone , Why , then she lives .
KENT : Is this the promised end
EDGAR : Or image of that horror ?
ALBANY : Fall , and cease !
KING LEAR : This feather stirs ; she lives ! if it be so , It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt .
KENT : O my good master !
KING LEAR : Prithee , away .
EDGAR : ' Tis noble Kent , your friend .
KING LEAR : A plague upon you , murderers , traitors all ! I might have saved her ; now she 's gone for ever ! Cordelia , Cordelia ! stay a little . Ha ! What is 't thou say 'st ? Her voice was ever soft , Gentle , and low , an excellent thing in woman . I kill 'd the slave that was a-hanging thee .
Captain : ' Tis true , my lords , he did .
