REGAN : Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent 's banishment .
GONERIL : There is further compliment of leavetaking between France and him . Pray you , let 's hit together : if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears , this last surrender of his will but offend us .
REGAN : We shall further think on 't .
GONERIL : We must do something , and i ' the heat . Enter EDMUND , with a letter
EDMUND : Thou , nature , art my goddess ; to thy law My services are bound . Wherefore should I Stand in the plague of custom , and permit The curiosity of nations to deprive me , For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines Lag of a brother ? Why bastard ? wherefore base ? When my dimensions are as well compact , My mind as generous , and my shape as true , As honest madam 's issue ? Why brand they us With base ? with baseness ? bastardy ? base , base ? Who , in the lusty stealth of nature , take More composition and fierce quality Than doth , within a dull , stale , tired bed , Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops , Got ' tween asleep and wake ? Well , then , Legitimate Edgar , I must have your land : Our father 's love is to the bastard Edmund As to the legitimate : fine word , --legitimate ! Well , my legitimate , if this letter speed , And my invention thrive , Edmund the base Shall top the legitimate . I grow ; I prosper : Now , gods , stand up for bastards ! Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER : Kent banish 'd thus ! and France in choler parted ! And the king gone to-night ! subscribed his power ! Confined to exhibition ! All this done Upon the gad ! Edmund , how now ! what news ?
EDMUND : So please your lordship , none . Putting up the letter
GLOUCESTER : Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ?
EDMUND : I know no news , my lord .
GLOUCESTER : What paper were you reading ?
EDMUND : Nothing , my lord .
GLOUCESTER : No ? What needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ? the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself . Let 's see : come , if it be nothing , I shall not need spectacles .
EDMUND : I beseech you , sir , pardon me : it is a letter from my brother , that I have not all o 'er-read ; and for so much as I have perused , I find it not fit for your o 'er-looking .
GLOUCESTER : Give me the letter , sir .
EDMUND : I shall offend , either to detain or give it . The contents , as in part I understand them , are to blame .
GLOUCESTER : Let 's see , let 's see .
EDMUND : I hope , for my brother 's justification , he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue .
GLOUCESTER : ' This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times ; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them . I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny ; who sways , not as it hath power , but as it is suffered . Come to me , that of this I may speak more . If our father would sleep till I waked him , you should half his revenue for ever , and live the beloved of your brother , EDGAR . ' Hum--conspiracy ! -- ' Sleep till I waked him , --you should enjoy half his revenue , ' --My son Edgar ! Had he a hand to write this ? a heart and brain to breed it in ? --When came this to you ? who brought it ?
EDMUND : It was not brought me , my lord ; there 's the cunning of it ; I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
GLOUCESTER : You know the character to be your brother 's ?
