KENT : I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall .
GLOUCESTER : It did always seem so to us : but now , in the division of the kingdom , it appears not which of the dukes he values most ; for equalities are so weighed , that curiosity in neither can make choice of either 's moiety .
KENT : Is not this your son , my lord ?
GLOUCESTER : His breeding , sir , hath been at my charge : I have so often blushed to acknowledge him , that now I am brazed to it .
KENT : I cannot conceive you .
GLOUCESTER : Sir , this young fellow 's mother could : whereupon she grew round-wombed , and had , indeed , sir , a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed . Do you smell a fault ?
KENT : I cannot wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper .
GLOUCESTER : But I have , sir , a son by order of law , some year elder than this , who yet is no dearer in my account : though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for , yet was his mother fair ; there was good sport at his making , and the whoreson must be acknowledged . Do you know this noble gentleman , Edmund ?
EDMUND : No , my lord .
GLOUCESTER : My lord of Kent : remember him hereafter as my honourable friend .
EDMUND : My services to your lordship .
KENT : I must love you , and sue to know you better .
EDMUND : Sir , I shall study deserving .
GLOUCESTER : He hath been out nine years , and away he shall again . The king is coming . Sennet . Enter KING LEAR , CORNWALL , ALBANY , GONERIL , REGAN , CORDELIA , and Attendants
KING LEAR : Attend the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
GLOUCESTER : I shall , my liege .
KING LEAR : Meantime we shall express our darker purpose . Give me the map there . Know that we have divided In three our kingdom : and ' tis our fast intent To shake all cares and business from our age ; Conferring them on younger strengths , while we Unburthen 'd crawl toward death . Our son of Cornwall , And you , our no less loving son of Albany , We have this hour a constant will to publish Our daughters ' several dowers , that future strife May be prevented now . The princes , France and Burgundy , Great rivals in our youngest daughter 's love , Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn , And here are to be answer 'd . Tell me , my daughters , -- Since now we will divest us both of rule , Interest of territory , cares of state , -- Which of you shall we say doth love us most ? That we our largest bounty may extend Where nature doth with merit challenge . Goneril , Our eldest-born , speak first .
GONERIL : Sir , I love you more than words can wield the matter ; Dearer than eye-sight , space , and liberty ; Beyond what can be valued , rich or rare ; No less than life , with grace , health , beauty , honour ; As much as child e 'er loved , or father found ; A love that makes breath poor , and speech unable ; Beyond all manner of so much I love you .
CORDELIA : What shall Cordelia do ? Love , and be silent .
LEAR : Of all these bounds , even from this line to this , With shadowy forests and with champains rich 'd , With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads , We make thee lady : to thine and Albany 's issue Be this perpetual . What says our second daughter , Our dearest Regan , wife to Cornwall ? Speak .
