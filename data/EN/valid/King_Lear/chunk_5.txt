GLOUCESTER : It is his .
EDMUND : It is his hand , my lord ; but I hope his heart is not in the contents .
GLOUCESTER : Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business ?
EDMUND : Never , my lord : but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit , that , sons at perfect age , and fathers declining , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue .
GLOUCESTER : O villain , villain ! His very opinion in the letter ! Abhorred villain ! Unnatural , detested , brutish villain ! worse than brutish ! Go , sirrah , seek him ; I 'll apprehend him : abominable villain ! Where is he ?
EDMUND : I do not well know , my lord . If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent , you shall run a certain course ; where , if you violently proceed against him , mistaking his purpose , it would make a great gap in your own honour , and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience . I dare pawn down my life for him , that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honour , and to no further pretence of danger .
GLOUCESTER : Think you so ?
EDMUND : If your honour judge it meet , I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this , and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction ; and that without any further delay than this very evening .
GLOUCESTER : He cannot be such a monster--
EDMUND : Nor is not , sure .
GLOUCESTER : To his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him . Heaven and earth ! Edmund , seek him out : wind me into him , I pray you : frame the business after your own wisdom . I would unstate myself , to be in a due resolution .
EDMUND : I will seek him , sir , presently : convey the business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal .
GLOUCESTER : These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us : though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects : love cools , friendship falls off , brothers divide : in cities , mutinies ; in countries , discord ; in palaces , treason ; and the bond cracked ' twixt son and father . This villain of mine comes under the prediction ; there 's son against father : the king falls from bias of nature ; there 's father against child . We have seen the best of our time : machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders , follow us disquietly to our graves . Find out this villain , Edmund ; it shall lose thee nothing ; do it carefully . And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished ! his offence , honesty ! ' Tis strange . Exit
EDMUND : This is the excellent foppery of the world , that , when we are sick in fortune , --often the surfeit of our own behavior , --we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars : as if we were villains by necessity ; fools by heavenly compulsion ; knaves , thieves , and treachers , by spherical predominance ; drunkards , liars , and adulterers , by an enforced obedience of planetary influence ; and all that we are evil in , by a divine thrusting on : an admirable evasion of whoremaster man , to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star ! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon 's tail ; and my nativity was under Ursa major ; so that it follows , I am rough and lecherous . Tut , I should have been that I am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing . Edgar-- Enter EDGAR And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy : my cue is villanous melancholy , with a sigh like Tom o ' Bedlam . O , these eclipses do portend these divisions ! fa , sol , la , mi .
