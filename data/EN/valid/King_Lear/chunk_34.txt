GLOUCESTER : The trick of that voice I do well remember : Is ' t not the king ?
KING LEAR : Ay , every inch a king : When I do stare , see how the subject quakes . I pardon that man 's life . What was thy cause ? Adultery ? Thou shalt not die : die for adultery ! No : The wren goes to ' t , and the small gilded fly Does lecher in my sight . Let copulation thrive ; for Gloucester 's bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters Got ' tween the lawful sheets . To ' t , luxury , pell-mell ! for I lack soldiers . Behold yond simpering dame , Whose face between her forks presages snow ; That minces virtue , and does shake the head To hear of pleasure 's name ; The fitchew , nor the soiled horse , goes to ' t With a more riotous appetite . Down from the waist they are Centaurs , Though women all above : But to the girdle do the gods inherit , Beneath is all the fiends ' ; There 's hell , there 's darkness , there 's the sulphurous pit , Burning , scalding , stench , consumption ; fie , fie , fie ! pah , pah ! Give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination : there 's money for thee .
GLOUCESTER : O , let me kiss that hand !
KING LEAR : Let me wipe it first ; it smells of mortality .
GLOUCESTER : O ruin 'd piece of nature ! This great world Shall so wear out to nought . Dost thou know me ?
KING LEAR : I remember thine eyes well enough . Dost thou squiny at me ? No , do thy worst , blind Cupid ! I 'll not love . Read thou this challenge ; mark but the penning of it .
GLOUCESTER : Were all the letters suns , I could not see one .
EDGAR : I would not take this from report ; it is , And my heart breaks at it .
KING LEAR : Read .
GLOUCESTER : What , with the case of eyes ?
KING LEAR : O , ho , are you there with me ? No eyes in your head , nor no money in your purse ? Your eyes are in a heavy case , your purse in a light ; yet you see how this world goes .
GLOUCESTER : I see it feelingly .
KING LEAR : What , art mad ? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes . Look with thine ears : see how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief . Hark , in thine ear : change places ; and , handy-dandy , which is the justice , which is the thief ? Thou hast seen a farmer 's dog bark at a beggar ?
GLOUCESTER : Ay , sir .
KING LEAR : And the creature run from the cur ? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority : a dog 's obeyed in office . Thou rascal beadle , hold thy bloody hand ! Why dost thou lash that whore ? Strip thine own back ; Thou hotly lust 'st to use her in that kind For which thou whipp 'st her . The usurer hangs the cozener . Through tatter 'd clothes small vices do appear ; Robes and furr 'd gowns hide all . Plate sin with gold , And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks : Arm it in rags , a pigmy 's straw does pierce it . None does offend , none , I say , none ; I 'll able ' em : Take that of me , my friend , who have the power To seal the accuser 's lips . Get thee glass eyes ; And like a scurvy politician , seem To see the things thou dost not . Now , now , now , now : Pull off my boots : harder , harder : so .
EDGAR : O , matter and impertinency mix 'd ! Reason in madness !
