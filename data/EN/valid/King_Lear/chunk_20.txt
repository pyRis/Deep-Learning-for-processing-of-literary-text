GONERIL : My lord , entreat him by no means to stay .
GLOUCESTER : Alack , the night comes on , and the bleak winds Do sorely ruffle ; for many miles a bout There 's scarce a bush .
REGAN : O , sir , to wilful men , The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters . Shut up your doors : He is attended with a desperate train ; And what they may incense him to , being apt To have his ear abused , wisdom bids fear .
CORNWALL : Shut up your doors , my lord ; ' tis a wild night : My Regan counsels well ; come out o ' the storm . Storm still . Enter KENT and a Gentleman , meeting
KENT : Who 's there , besides foul weather ?
Gentleman : One minded like the weather , most unquietly .
KENT : I know you . Where 's the king ?
Gentleman : Contending with the fretful element : Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea , Or swell the curled water ' bove the main , That things might change or cease ; tears his white hair , Which the impetuous blasts , with eyeless rage , Catch in their fury , and make nothing of ; Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain . This night , wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch , The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry , unbonneted he runs , And bids what will take all .
KENT : But who is with him ?
Gentleman : None but the fool ; who labours to out-jest His heart-struck injuries .
KENT : Sir , I do know you ; And dare , upon the warrant of my note , Commend a dear thing to you . There is division , Although as yet the face of it be cover 'd With mutual cunning , ' twixt Albany and Cornwall ; Who have--as who have not , that their great stars Throned and set high ? --servants , who seem no less , Which are to France the spies and speculations Intelligent of our state ; what hath been seen , Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes , Or the hard rein which both of them have borne Against the old kind king ; or something deeper , Whereof perchance these are but furnishings ; But , true it is , from France there comes a power Into this scatter 'd kingdom ; who already , Wise in our negligence , have secret feet In some of our best ports , and are at point To show their open banner . Now to you : If on my credit you dare build so far To make your speed to Dover , you shall find Some that will thank you , making just report Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow The king hath cause to plain . I am a gentleman of blood and breeding ; And , from some knowledge and assurance , offer This office to you .
Gentleman : I will talk further with you .
KENT : No , do not . For confirmation that I am much more Than my out-wall , open this purse , and take What it contains . If you shall see Cordelia , -- As fear not but you shall , --show her this ring ; And she will tell you who your fellow is That yet you do not know . Fie on this storm ! I will go seek the king .
Gentleman : Give me your hand : have you no more to say ?
KENT : Few words , but , to effect , more than all yet ; That , when we have found the king , --in which your pain That way , I 'll this , --he that first lights on him Holla the other . Enter KING LEAR and Fool
KING LEAR : Blow , winds , and crack your cheeks ! rage ! blow ! You cataracts and hurricanoes , spout Till you have drench 'd our steeples , drown 'd the cocks ! You sulphurous and thought-executing fires , Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts , Singe my white head ! And thou , all-shaking thunder , Smite flat the thick rotundity o ' the world ! Crack nature 's moulds , an germens spill at once , That make ingrateful man !
