FALSTAFF : Come , manage me your caliver . So : very well : go to : very good , exceeding good . O , give me always a little , lean , old , chapt , bald shot . Well said , i ' faith , Wart ; thou 'rt a good scab : hold , there 's a tester for thee .
SHALLOW : He is not his craft 's master ; he doth not do it right . I remember at Mile-end Green , when I lay at Clement 's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur 's show , --there was a little quiver fellow , and a ' would manage you his piece thus ; and a ' would about and about , and come you in and come you in : ' rah , tah , tah , ' would a ' say ; ' bounce ' would a ' say ; and away again would a ' go , and again would a ' come : I shall ne 'er see such a fellow .
FALSTAFF : These fellows will do well , Master Shallow . God keep you , Master Silence : I will not use many words with you . Fare you well , gentlemen both : I thank you : I must a dozen mile to-night . Bardolph , give the soldiers coats .
SHALLOW : Sir John , the Lord bless you ! God prosper your affairs ! God send us peace ! At your return visit our house ; let our old acquaintance be renewed ; peradventure I will with ye to the court .
FALSTAFF : ' Fore God , I would you would , Master Shallow .
SHALLOW : Go to ; I have spoke at a word . God keep you .
FALSTAFF : Fare you well , gentle gentlemen . On , Bardolph ; lead the men away . As I return , I will fetch off these justices : I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow . Lord , Lord , how subject we old men are to this vice of lying ! This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth , and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street : and every third word a lie , duer paid to the hearer than the Turk 's tribute . I do remember him at Clement 's Inn like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring : when a ' was naked , he was , for all the world , like a forked radish , with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife : a ' was so forlorn , that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible : a ' was the very genius of famine ; yet lecherous as a monkey , and the whores called him mandrake : a ' came ever in the rearward of the fashion , and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle , and swear they were his fancies or his good-nights . And now is this Vice 's dagger become a squire , and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him ; and I 'll be sworn a ' ne 'er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard ; and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal 's men . I saw it , and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name ; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin ; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him , a court : and now has he land and beefs . Well , I 'll be acquainted with him , if I return ; and it shall go hard but I will make him a philosopher 's two stones to me : if the young dace be a bait for the old pike , I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him . Let time shape , and there an end . Exit Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK , MOWBRAY , LORD HASTINGS , and others
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : What is this forest call 'd ?
HASTINGS : ' Tis Gaultree Forest , an 't shall please your grace .
