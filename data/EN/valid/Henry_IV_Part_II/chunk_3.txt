FALSTAFF : Sirrah , you giant , what says the doctor to my water ?
Page : He said , sir , the water itself was a good healthy water ; but , for the party that owed it , he might have more diseases than he knew for .
FALSTAFF : Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me : the brain of this foolish-compounded clay , man , is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter , more than I invent or is invented on me : I am not only witty in myself , but the cause that wit is in other men . I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one . If the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off , why then I have no judgment . Thou whoreson mandrake , thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels . I was never manned with an agate till now : but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver , but in vile apparel , and send you back again to your master , for a jewel , -- the juvenal , the prince your master , whose chin is not yet fledged . I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek ; and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face-royal : God may finish it when he will , ' tis not a hair amiss yet : he may keep it still at a face-royal , for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it ; and yet he 'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor . He may keep his own grace , but he 's almost out of mine , I can assure him . What said Master Dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and my slops ?
Page : He said , sir , you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph : he would not take his band and yours ; he liked not the security .
FALSTAFF : Let him be damned , like the glutton ! pray God his tongue be hotter ! A whoreson Achitophel ! a rascally yea-forsooth knave ! to bear a gentleman in hand , and then stand upon security ! The whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes , and bunches of keys at their girdles ; and if a man is through with them in honest taking up , then they must stand upon security . I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security . I looked a ' should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin , as I am a true knight , and he sends me security . Well , he may sleep in security ; for he hath the horn of abundance , and the lightness of his wife shines through it : and yet cannot he see , though he have his own lanthorn to light him . Where 's Bardolph ?
Page : He 's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse .
FALSTAFF : I bought him in Paul 's , and he 'll buy me a horse in Smithfield : an I could get me but a wife in the stews , I were manned , horsed , and wived . Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant
Page : Sir , here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph .
FALSTAFF : Wait , close ; I will not see him . Lord Chief-Justice What 's he that goes there ?
Servant : Falstaff , an 't please your lordship . Lord Chief-Justice He that was in question for the robbery ?
Servant : He , my lord : but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury ; and , as I hear , is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster . Lord Chief-Justice What , to York ? Call him back again .
Servant : Sir John Falstaff !
FALSTAFF : Boy , tell him I am deaf .
