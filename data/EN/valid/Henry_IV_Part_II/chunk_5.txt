FALSTAFF : My lord ? Lord Chief-Justice But since all is well , keep it so : wake not a sleeping wolf .
FALSTAFF : To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox . Lord Chief-Justice What ! you are as a candle , the better part burnt out .
FALSTAFF : A wassail candle , my lord , all tallow : if I did say of wax , my growth would approve the truth . Lord Chief-Justice There is not a white hair on your face but should have his effect of gravity .
FALSTAFF : His effect of gravy , gravy , gravy . Lord Chief-Justice You follow the young prince up and down , like his ill angel .
FALSTAFF : Not so , my lord ; your ill angel is light ; but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing : and yet , in some respects , I grant , I cannot go : I cannot tell . Virtue is of so little regard in these costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd : pregnancy is made a tapster , and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings : all the other gifts appertinent to man , as the malice of this age shapes them , are not worth a gooseberry . You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young ; you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls : and we that are in the vaward of our youth , I must confess , are wags too . Lord Chief-Justice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth , that are written down old with all the characters of age ? Have you not a moist eye ? a dry hand ? a yellow cheek ? a white beard ? a decreasing leg ? an increasing belly ? is not your voice broken ? your wind short ? your chin double ? your wit single ? and every part about you blasted with antiquity ? and will you yet call yourself young ? Fie , fie , fie , Sir John !
FALSTAFF : My lord , I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon , with a white head and something a round belly . For my voice , I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems . To approve my youth further , I will not : the truth is , I am only old in judgment and understanding ; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks , let him lend me the money , and have at him ! For the box of the ear that the prince gave you , he gave it like a rude prince , and you took it like a sensible lord . I have chequed him for it , and the young lion repents ; marry , not in ashes and sackcloth , but in new silk and old sack . Lord Chief-Justice Well , God send the prince a better companion !
FALSTAFF : God send the companion a better prince ! I cannot rid my hands of him . Lord Chief-Justice Well , the king hath severed you and Prince Harry : I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland .
