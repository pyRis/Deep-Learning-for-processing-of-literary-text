KING HENRY IV : Now , lords , if God doth give successful end To this debate that bleedeth at our doors , We will our youth lead on to higher fields And draw no swords but what are sanctified . Our navy is address 'd , our power collected , Our substitutes in absence well invested , And every thing lies level to our wish : Only , we want a little personal strength ; And pause us , till these rebels , now afoot , Come underneath the yoke of government .
WARWICK : Both which we doubt not but your majesty Shall soon enjoy .
KING HENRY IV : Humphrey , my son of Gloucester , Where is the prince your brother ?
GLOUCESTER : I think he 's gone to hunt , my lord , at Windsor .
KING HENRY IV : And how accompanied ?
GLOUCESTER : I do not know , my lord .
KING HENRY IV : Is not his brother , Thomas of Clarence , with him ?
GLOUCESTER : No , my good lord ; he is in presence here .
CLARENCE : What would my lord and father ?
KING HENRY IV : Nothing but well to thee , Thomas of Clarence . How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother ? He loves thee , and thou dost neglect him , Thomas ; Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers : cherish it , my boy , And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation , after I am dead , Between his greatness and thy other brethren : Therefore omit him not ; blunt not his love , Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will ; For he is gracious , if he be observed : He hath a tear for pity and a hand Open as day for melting charity : Yet notwithstanding , being incensed , he 's flint , As humorous as winter and as sudden As flaws congealed in the spring of day . His temper , therefore , must be well observed : Chide him for faults , and do it reverently , When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth ; But , being moody , give him line and scope , Till that his passions , like a whale on ground , Confound themselves with working . Learn this , Thomas , And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends , A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in , That the united vessel of their blood , Mingled with venom of suggestion-- As , force perforce , the age will pour it in-- Shall never leak , though it do work as strong As aconitum or rash gunpowder .
CLARENCE : I shall observe him with all care and love .
KING HENRY IV : Why art thou not at Windsor with him , Thomas ?
CLARENCE : He is not there to-day ; he dines in London .
KING HENRY IV : And how accompanied ? canst thou tell that ?
CLARENCE : With Poins , and other his continual followers .
KING HENRY IV : Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds ; And he , the noble image of my youth , Is overspread with them : therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death : The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape In forms imaginary the unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon When I am sleeping with my ancestors . For when his headstrong riot hath no curb , When rage and hot blood are his counsellors , When means and lavish manners meet together , O , with what wings shall his affections fly Towards fronting peril and opposed decay !
