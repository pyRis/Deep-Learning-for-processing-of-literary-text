WESTMORELAND : This will I show the general . Please you , lords , In sight of both our battles we may meet ; And either end in peace , which God so frame ! Or to the place of difference call the swords Which must decide it .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : My lord , we will do so . Exit WESTMORELAND
MOWBRAY : There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand .
HASTINGS : Fear you not that : if we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon , Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains .
MOWBRAY : Yea , but our valuation shall be such That every slight and false-derived cause , Yea , every idle , nice and wanton reason Shall to the king taste of this action ; That , were our royal faiths martyrs in love , We shall be winnow 'd with so rough a wind That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff And good from bad find no partition .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : No , no , my lord . Note this ; the king is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances : For he hath found to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life , And therefore will he wipe his tables clean And keep no tell-tale to his memory That may repeat and history his loss To new remembrance ; for full well he knows He cannot so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion : His foes are so enrooted with his friends That , plucking to unfix an enemy , He doth unfasten so and shake a friend : So that this land , like an offensive wife That hath enraged him on to offer strokes , As he is striking , holds his infant up And hangs resolved correction in the arm That was uprear 'd to execution .
HASTINGS : Besides , the king hath wasted all his rods On late offenders , that he now doth lack The very instruments of chastisement : So that his power , like to a fangless lion , May offer , but not hold .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : ' Tis very true : And therefore be assured , my good lord marshal , If we do now make our atonement well , Our peace will , like a broken limb united , Grow stronger for the breaking .
MOWBRAY : Be it so . Here is return 'd my Lord of Westmoreland . Re-enter WESTMORELAND
WESTMORELAND : The prince is here at hand : pleaseth your lordship To meet his grace just distance ' tween our armies .
MOWBRAY : Your grace of York , in God 's name then , set forward .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Before , and greet his grace : my lord , we come . Enter , from one side , MOWBRAY , attended ; afterwards the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK , HASTINGS , and others : from the other side , Prince John of LANCASTER , and WESTMORELAND ; Officers , and others with them
