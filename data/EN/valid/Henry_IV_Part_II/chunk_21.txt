FALSTAFF : Yea , marry , let me have him to sit under : he 's like to be a cold soldier .
SHALLOW : Where 's Shadow ?
SHADOW : Here , sir .
FALSTAFF : Shadow , whose son art thou ?
SHADOW : My mother 's son , sir .
FALSTAFF : Thy mother 's son ! like enough , and thy father 's shadow : so the son of the female is the shadow of the male : it is often so , indeed ; but much of the father 's substance !
SHALLOW : Do you like him , Sir John ?
FALSTAFF : Shadow will serve for summer ; prick him , for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book .
SHALLOW : Thomas Wart !
FALSTAFF : Where 's he ?
WART : Here , sir .
FALSTAFF : Is thy name Wart ?
WART : Yea , sir .
FALSTAFF : Thou art a very ragged wart .
SHALLOW : Shall I prick him down , Sir John ?
FALSTAFF : It were superfluous ; for his apparel is built upon his back and the whole frame stands upon pins : prick him no more .
SHALLOW : Ha , ha , ha ! you can do it , sir ; you can do it : I commend you well . Francis Feeble !
FEEBLE : Here , sir .
FALSTAFF : What trade art thou , Feeble ?
FEEBLE : A woman 's tailor , sir .
SHALLOW : Shall I prick him , sir ?
FALSTAFF : You may : but if he had been a man 's tailor , he 'ld ha ' pricked you . Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy 's battle as thou hast done in a woman 's petticoat ?
FEEBLE : I will do my good will , sir ; you can have no more .
FALSTAFF : Well said , good woman 's tailor ! well said , courageous Feeble ! thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse . Prick the woman 's tailor : well , Master Shallow ; deep , Master Shallow .
FEEBLE : I would Wart might have gone , sir .
FALSTAFF : I would thou wert a man 's tailor , that thou mightst mend him and make him fit to go . I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands : let that suffice , most forcible Feeble .
FEEBLE : It shall suffice , sir .
FALSTAFF : I am bound to thee , reverend Feeble . Who is next ?
SHALLOW : Peter Bullcalf o ' the green !
FALSTAFF : Yea , marry , let 's see Bullcalf .
BULLCALF : Here , sir .
FALSTAFF : ' Fore God , a likely fellow ! Come , prick me Bullcalf till he roar again .
BULLCALF : O Lord ! good my lord captain , --
FALSTAFF : What , dost thou roar before thou art pricked ?
BULLCALF : O Lord , sir ! I am a diseased man .
FALSTAFF : What disease hast thou ?
BULLCALF : A whoreson cold , sir , a cough , sir , which I caught with ringing in the king 's affairs upon his coronation-day , sir .
FALSTAFF : Come , thou shalt go to the wars in a gown ; we wilt have away thy cold ; and I will take such order that my friends shall ring for thee . Is here all ?
SHALLOW : Here is two more called than your number , you must have but four here , sir : and so , I pray you , go in with me to dinner .
FALSTAFF : Come , I will go drink with you , but I cannot tarry dinner . I am glad to see you , by my troth , Master Shallow .
SHALLOW : O , Sir John , do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George 's field ?
FALSTAFF : No more of that , good Master Shallow , no more of that .
SHALLOW : Ha ! ' twas a merry night . And is Jane Nightwork alive ?
FALSTAFF : She lives , Master Shallow .
SHALLOW : She never could away with me .
