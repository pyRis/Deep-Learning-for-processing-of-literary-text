KING HENRY IV : ' Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb In the dead carrion . Enter WESTMORELAND Who 's here ? Westmoreland ?
WESTMORELAND : Health to my sovereign , and new happiness Added to that that I am to deliver ! Prince John your son doth kiss your grace 's hand : Mowbray , the Bishop Scroop , Hastings and all Are brought to the correction of your law ; There is not now a rebel 's sword unsheath 'd But peace puts forth her olive every where . The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your highness read , With every course in his particular .
KING HENRY IV : O Westmoreland , thou art a summer bird , Which ever in the haunch of winter sings The lifting up of day . Enter HARCOURT Look , here 's more news .
HARCOURT : From enemies heaven keep your majesty ; And , when they stand against you , may they fall As those that I am come to tell you of ! The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph , With a great power of English and of Scots Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown : The manner and true order of the fight This packet , please it you , contains at large .
KING HENRY IV : And wherefore should these good news make me sick ? Will fortune never come with both hands full , But write her fair words still in foulest letters ? She either gives a stomach and no food ; Such are the poor , in health ; or else a feast And takes away the stomach ; such are the rich , That have abundance and enjoy it not . I should rejoice now at this happy news ; And now my sight fails , and my brain is giddy : O me ! come near me ; now I am much ill .
GLOUCESTER : Comfort , your majesty !
CLARENCE : O my royal father !
WESTMORELAND : My sovereign lord , cheer up yourself , look up .
WARWICK : Be patient , princes ; you do know , these fits Are with his highness very ordinary . Stand from him . Give him air ; he 'll straight be well .
CLARENCE : No , no , he cannot long hold out these pangs : The incessant care and labour of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in So thin that life looks through and will break out .
GLOUCESTER : The people fear me ; for they do observe Unfather 'd heirs and loathly births of nature : The seasons change their manners , as the year Had found some months asleep and leap 'd them over .
CLARENCE : The river hath thrice flow 'd , no ebb between ; And the old folk , time 's doting chronicles , Say it did so a little time before That our great-grandsire , Edward , sick 'd and died .
WARWICK : Speak lower , princes , for the king recovers .
GLOUCESTER : This apoplexy will certain be his end .
KING HENRY IV : I pray you , take me up , and bear me hence Into some other chamber : softly , pray . KING HENRY IV lying on a bed : CLARENCE , GLOUCESTER , WARWICK , and others in attendance
KING HENRY IV : Let there be no noise made , my gentle friends ; Unless some dull and favourable hand Will whisper music to my weary spirit .
WARWICK : Call for the music in the other room .
KING HENRY IV : Set me the crown upon my pillow here .
CLARENCE : His eye is hollow , and he changes much .
WARWICK : Less noise , less noise ! Enter PRINCE HENRY
PRINCE HENRY : Who saw the Duke of Clarence ?
CLARENCE : I am here , brother , full of heaviness .
PRINCE HENRY : How now ! rain within doors , and none abroad ! How doth the king ?
GLOUCESTER : Exceeding ill .
PRINCE HENRY : Heard he the good news yet ? Tell it him .
GLOUCESTER : He alter 'd much upon the hearing it .
PRINCE HENRY : If he be sick with joy , he 'll recover without physic .
