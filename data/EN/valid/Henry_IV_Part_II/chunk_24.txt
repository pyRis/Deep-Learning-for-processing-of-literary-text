HASTINGS : We have sent forth already .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : ' Tis well done . My friends and brethren in these great affairs , I must acquaint you that I have received New-dated letters from Northumberland ; Their cold intent , tenor and substance , thus : Here doth he wish his person , with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality , The which he could not levy ; whereupon He is retired , to ripe his growing fortunes , To Scotland : and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful melting of their opposite .
MOWBRAY : Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to pieces . Enter a Messenger
HASTINGS : Now , what news ?
Messenger : West of this forest , scarcely off a mile , In goodly form comes on the enemy ; And , by the ground they hide , I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand .
MOWBRAY : The just proportion that we gave them out Let us sway on and face them in the field .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : What well-appointed leader fronts us here ? Enter WESTMORELAND
MOWBRAY : I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland .
WESTMORELAND : Health and fair greeting from our general , The prince , Lord John and Duke of Lancaster .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Say on , my Lord of Westmoreland , in peace : What doth concern your coming ?
WESTMORELAND : Then , my lord , Unto your grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech . If that rebellion Came like itself , in base and abject routs , Led on by bloody youth , guarded with rags , And countenanced by boys and beggary , I say , if damn 'd commotion so appear 'd , In his true , native and most proper shape , You , reverend father , and these noble lords Had not been here , to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection With your fair honours . You , lord archbishop , Whose see is by a civil peace maintained , Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch 'd , Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor 'd , Whose white investments figure innocence , The dove and very blessed spirit of peace , Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace , Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war ; Turning your books to graves , your ink to blood , Your pens to lances and your tongue divine To a trumpet and a point of war ?
