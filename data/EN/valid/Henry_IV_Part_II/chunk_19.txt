WARWICK : There is a history in all men 's lives , Figuring the nature of the times deceased ; The which observed , a man may prophesy , With a near aim , of the main chance of things As yet not come to life , which in their seeds And weak beginnings lie intreasured . Such things become the hatch and brood of time ; And by the necessary form of this King Richard might create a perfect guess That great Northumberland , then false to him , Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness ; Which should not find a ground to root upon , Unless on you .
KING HENRY IV : Are these things then necessities ? Then let us meet them like necessities : And that same word even now cries out on us : They say the bishop and Northumberland Are fifty thousand strong .
WARWICK : It cannot be , my lord ; Rumour doth double , like the voice and echo , The numbers of the fear 'd . Please it your grace To go to bed . Upon my soul , my lord , The powers that you already have sent forth Shall bring this prize in very easily . To comfort you the more , I have received A certain instance that Glendower is dead . Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill , And these unseason 'd hours perforce must add Unto your sickness .
KING HENRY IV : I will take your counsel : And were these inward wars once out of hand , We would , dear lords , unto the Holy Land . Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE , meeting ; MOULDY , SHADOW , WART , FEEBLE , BULLCALF , a Servant or two with them
SHALLOW : Come on , come on , come on , sir ; give me your hand , sir , give me your hand , sir : an early stirrer , by the rood ! And how doth my good cousin Silence ?
SILENCE : Good morrow , good cousin Shallow .
SHALLOW : And how doth my cousin , your bedfellow ? and your fairest daughter and mine , my god-daughter Ellen ?
SILENCE : Alas , a black ousel , cousin Shallow !
SHALLOW : By yea and nay , sir , I dare say my cousin William is become a good scholar : he is at Oxford still , is he not ?
SILENCE : Indeed , sir , to my cost .
SHALLOW : A ' must , then , to the inns o ' court shortly . I was once of Clement 's Inn , where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet .
SILENCE : You were called ' lusty Shallow ' then , cousin .
SHALLOW : By the mass , I was called any thing ; and I would have done any thing indeed too , and roundly too . There was I , and little John Doit of Staffordshire , and black George Barnes , and Francis Pickbone , and Will Squele , a Cotswold man ; you had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the inns o ' court again : and I may say to you , we knew where the bona-robas were and had the best of them all at commandment . Then was Jack Falstaff , now Sir John , a boy , and page to Thomas Mowbray , Duke of Norfolk .
SILENCE : This Sir John , cousin , that comes hither anon about soldiers ?
SHALLOW : The same Sir John , the very same . I see him break Skogan 's head at the court-gate , when a ' was a crack not thus high : and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish , a fruiterer , behind Gray 's Inn . Jesu , Jesu , the mad days that I have spent ! and to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead !
SILENCE : We shall all follow , cousin .
SHADOW : Certain , ' tis certain ; very sure , very sure : death , as the Psalmist saith , is certain to all ; all shall die . How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair ?
SILENCE : By my troth , I was not there .
SHALLOW : Death is certain . Is old Double of your town living yet ?
SILENCE : Dead , sir .
