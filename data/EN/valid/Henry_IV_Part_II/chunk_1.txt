NORTHUMBERLAND : Ha ! Again : Said he young Harry Percy 's spur was cold ? Of Hotspur Coldspur ? that rebellion Had met ill luck ?
LORD BARDOLPH : My lord , I 'll tell you what ; If my young lord your son have not the day , Upon mine honour , for a silken point I 'll give my barony : never talk of it .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of loss ?
LORD BARDOLPH : Who , he ? He was some hilding fellow that had stolen The horse he rode on , and , upon my life , Spoke at a venture . Look , here comes more news . Enter MORTON
NORTHUMBERLAND : Yea , this man 's brow , like to a title-leaf , Foretells the nature of a tragic volume : So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witness 'd usurpation . Say , Morton , didst thou come from Shrewsbury ?
MORTON : I ran from Shrewsbury , my noble lord ; Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask To fright our party .
NORTHUMBERLAND : How doth my son and brother ? Thou tremblest ; and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand . Even such a man , so faint , so spiritless , So dull , so dead in look , so woe-begone , Drew Priam 's curtain in the dead of night , And would have told him half his Troy was burnt ; But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue , And I my Percy 's death ere thou report 'st it . This thou wouldst say , ' Your son did thus and thus ; Your brother thus : so fought the noble Douglas : ' Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds : But in the end , to stop my ear indeed , Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise , Ending with ' Brother , son , and all are dead . ' 
MORTON : Douglas is living , and your brother , yet ; But , for my lord your son--
NORTHUMBERLAND : Why , he is dead . See what a ready tongue suspicion hath ! He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath by instinct knowledge from others ' eyes That what he fear 'd is chanced . Yet speak , Morton ; Tell thou an earl his divination lies , And I will take it as a sweet disgrace And make thee rich for doing me such wrong .
MORTON : You are too great to be by me gainsaid : Your spirit is too true , your fears too certain .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Yet , for all this , say not that Percy 's dead . I see a strange confession in thine eye : Thou shakest thy head and hold 'st it fear or sin To speak a truth . If he be slain , say so ; The tongue offends not that reports his death : And he doth sin that doth belie the dead , Not he which says the dead is not alive . Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office , and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell , Remember 'd tolling a departing friend .
LORD BARDOLPH : I cannot think , my lord , your son is dead .
