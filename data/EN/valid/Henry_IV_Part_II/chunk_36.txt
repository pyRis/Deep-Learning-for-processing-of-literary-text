SHALLOW : Sir John !
FALSTAFF : I come , Master Shallow ; I come , Master Shallow . Exit Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice , meeting
WARWICK : How now , my lord chief-justice ! whither away ? Lord Chief-Justice How doth the king ?
WARWICK : Exceeding well ; his cares are now all ended . Lord Chief-Justice I hope , not dead .
WARWICK : He 's walk 'd the way of nature ; And to our purposes he lives no more . Lord Chief-Justice I would his majesty had call 'd me with him : The service that I truly did his life Hath left me open to all injuries .
WARWICK : Indeed I think the young king loves you not . Lord Chief-Justice I know he doth not , and do arm myself To welcome the condition of the time , Which cannot look more hideously upon me Than I have drawn it in my fantasy . Enter LANCASTER , CLARENCE , GLOUCESTER , WESTMORELAND , and others
WARWICK : Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry : O that the living Harry had the temper Of him , the worst of these three gentlemen ! How many nobles then should hold their places That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort ! Lord Chief-Justice O God , I fear all will be overturn 'd !
LANCASTER : Good morrow , cousin Warwick , good morrow .
GLOUCESTER CLARENCE : Good morrow , cousin .
LANCASTER : We meet like men that had forgot to speak .
WARWICK : We do remember ; but our argument Is all too heavy to admit much talk .
LANCASTER : Well , peace be with him that hath made us heavy . Lord Chief-Justice Peace be with us , lest we be heavier !
GLOUCESTER : O , good my lord , you have lost a friend indeed ; And I dare swear you borrow not that face Of seeming sorrow , it is sure your own .
LANCASTER : Though no man be assured what grace to find , You stand in coldest expectation : I am the sorrier ; would ' twere otherwise .
CLARENCE : Well , you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair ; Which swims against your stream of quality . Lord Chief-Justice Sweet princes , what I did , I did in honour , Led by the impartial conduct of my soul : And never shall you see that I will beg A ragged and forestall 'd remission . If truth and upright innocency fail me , I 'll to the king my master that is dead , And tell him who hath sent me after him .
WARWICK : Here comes the prince . Enter KING HENRY V , attended Lord Chief-Justice Good morrow ; and God save your majesty !
KING HENRY V : This new and gorgeous garment , majesty , Sits not so easy on me as you think . Brothers , you mix your sadness with some fear : This is the English , not the Turkish court ; Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds , But Harry Harry . Yet be sad , good brothers , For , by my faith , it very well becomes you : Sorrow so royally in you appears That I will deeply put the fashion on And wear it in my heart : why then , be sad ; But entertain no more of it , good brothers , Than a joint burden laid upon us all . For me , by heaven , I bid you be assured , I 'll be your father and your brother too ; Let me but bear your love , I ' ll bear your cares : Yet weep that Harry 's dead ; and so will I ; But Harry lives , that shall convert those tears By number into hours of happiness .
Princes : We hope no other from your majesty .
KING HENRY V : You all look strangely on me : and you most ; You are , I think , assured I love you not . Lord Chief-Justice I am assured , if I be measured rightly , Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me .
