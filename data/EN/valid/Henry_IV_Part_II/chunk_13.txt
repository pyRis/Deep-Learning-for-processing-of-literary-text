NORTHUMBERLAND : Come , come , go in with me . ' Tis with my mind As with the tide swell 'd up unto his height , That makes a still-stand , running neither way : Fain would I go to meet the archbishop , But many thousand reasons hold me back . I will resolve for Scotland : there am I , Till time and vantage crave my company . Enter two Drawers
First Drawer : What the devil hast thou brought there ? apple-johns ? thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john .
Second Drawer : Mass , thou sayest true . The prince once set a dish of apple-johns before him , and told him there were five more Sir Johns , and , putting off his hat , said ' I will now take my leave of these six dry , round , old , withered knights . ' It angered him to the heart : but he hath forgot that .
First Drawer : Why , then , cover , and set them down : and see if thou canst find out Sneak 's noise ; Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some music . Dispatch : the room where they supped is too hot ; they 'll come in straight .
Second Drawer : Sirrah , here will be the prince and Master Poins anon ; and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons ; and Sir John must not know of it : Bardolph hath brought word .
First Drawer : By the mass , here will be old Utis : it will be an excellent stratagem .
Second Drawer : I 'll see if I can find out Sneak . Exit Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET
MISTRESS QUICKLY : I ' faith , sweetheart , methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality : your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire ; and your colour , I warrant you , is as red as any rose , in good truth , la ! But , i ' faith , you have drunk too much canaries ; and that 's a marvellous searching wine , and it perfumes the blood ere one can say ' What 's this ? ' How do you now ?
DOLL TEARSHEET : Better than I was : hem !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Why , that 's well said ; a good heart 's worth gold . Lo , here comes Sir John . Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF : ' When Arthur first in court , ' --Empty the jordan . Exit First Drawer Singing -- ' And was a worthy king . ' How now , Mistress Doll !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Sick of a calm ; yea , good faith .
FALSTAFF : So is all her sect ; an they be once in a calm , they are sick .
DOLL TEARSHEET : You muddy rascal , is that all the comfort you give me ?
FALSTAFF : You make fat rascals , Mistress Doll .
DOLL TEARSHEET : I make them ! gluttony and diseases make them ; I make them not .
FALSTAFF : If the cook help to make the gluttony , you help to make the diseases , Doll : we catch of you , Doll , we catch of you ; grant that , my poor virtue grant that .
DOLL TEARSHEET : Yea , joy , our chains and our jewels .
FALSTAFF : ' Your broaches , pearls , and ouches : ' for to serve bravely is to come halting off , you know : to come off the breach with his pike bent bravely , and to surgery bravely ; to venture upon the charged chambers bravely , --
DOLL TEARSHEET : Hang yourself , you muddy conger , hang yourself !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : By my troth , this is the old fashion ; you two never meet but you fall to some discord : you are both , i ' good truth , as rheumatic as two dry toasts ; you cannot one bear with another 's confirmities . What the good-year ! one must bear , and that must be you : you are the weaker vessel , as they say , the emptier vessel .
