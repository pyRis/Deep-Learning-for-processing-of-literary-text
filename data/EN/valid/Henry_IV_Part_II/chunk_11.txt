Page : A ' calls me e 'en now , my lord , through a red lattice , and I could discern no part of his face from the window : at last I spied his eyes , and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife 's new petticoat and so peeped through .
PRINCE HENRY : Has not the boy profited ?
BARDOLPH : Away , you whoreson upright rabbit , away !
Page : Away , you rascally Althaea 's dream , away !
PRINCE HENRY : Instruct us , boy ; what dream , boy ?
Page : Marry , my lord , Althaea dreamed she was delivered of a fire-brand ; and therefore I call him her dream .
PRINCE HENRY : A crown 's worth of good interpretation : there ' tis , boy .
POINS : O , that this good blossom could be kept from cankers ! Well , there is sixpence to preserve thee .
BARDOLPH : An you do not make him hanged among you , the gallows shall have wrong .
PRINCE HENRY : And how doth thy master , Bardolph ?
BARDOLPH : Well , my lord . He heard of your grace 's coming to town : there 's a letter for you .
POINS : Delivered with good respect . And how doth the martlemas , your master ?
BARDOLPH : In bodily health , sir .
POINS : Marry , the immortal part needs a physician ; but that moves not him : though that be sick , it dies not .
PRINCE HENRY : I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog ; and he holds his place ; for look you how be writes .
POINS : ' John Falstaff , knight , ' --every man must know that , as oft as he has occasion to name himself : even like those that are kin to the king ; for they never prick their finger but they say , ' There 's some of the king 's blood spilt . ' ' How comes that ? ' says he , that takes upon him not to conceive . The answer is as ready as a borrower 's cap , ' I am the king 's poor cousin , sir . ' 
PRINCE HENRY : Nay , they will be kin to us , or they will fetch it from Japhet . But to the letter .
POINS : ' Sir John Falstaff , knight , to the son of the king , nearest his father , Harry Prince of Wales , greeting . ' Why , this is a certificate .
PRINCE HENRY : Peace !
POINS : ' I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity : ' he sure means brevity in breath , short-winded . ' I commend me to thee , I commend thee , and I leave thee . Be not too familiar with Poins ; for he misuses thy favours so much , that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell . Repent at idle times as thou mayest ; and so , farewell . Thine , by yea and no , which is as much as to say , as thou usest him , JACK FALSTAFF with my familiars , JOHN with my brothers and sisters , and SIR JOHN with all Europe . ' My lord , I 'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it .
PRINCE HENRY : That 's to make him eat twenty of his words . But do you use me thus , Ned ? must I marry your sister ?
POINS : God send the wench no worse fortune ! But I never said so .
PRINCE HENRY : Well , thus we play the fools with the time , and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us . Is your master here in London ?
BARDOLPH : Yea , my lord .
PRINCE HENRY : Where sups he ? doth the old boar feed in the old frank ?
BARDOLPH : At the old place , my lord , in Eastcheap .
PRINCE HENRY : What company ?
Page : Ephesians , my lord , of the old church .
PRINCE HENRY : Sup any women with him ?
Page : None , my lord , but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet .
PRINCE HENRY : What pagan may that be ?
