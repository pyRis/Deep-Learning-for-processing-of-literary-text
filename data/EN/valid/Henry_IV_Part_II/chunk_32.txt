CLARENCE : Let us withdraw into the other room .
WARWICK : Will 't please your grace to go along with us ?
PRINCE HENRY : No ; I will sit and watch here by the king . Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow , Being so troublesome a bedfellow ? O polish 'd perturbation ! golden care ! That keep 'st the ports of slumber open wide To many a watchful night ! sleep with it now ! Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet As he whose brow with homely biggen bound Snores out the watch of night . O majesty ! When thou dost pinch thy bearer , thou dost sit Like a rich armour worn in heat of day , That scalds with safety . By his gates of breath There lies a downy feather which stirs not : Did he suspire , that light and weightless down Perforce must move . My gracious lord ! my father ! This sleep is sound indeed , this is a sleep That from this golden rigol hath divorced So many English kings . Thy due from me Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood , Which nature , love , and filial tenderness , Shall , O dear father , pay thee plenteously : My due from thee is this imperial crown , Which , as immediate as thy place and blood , Derives itself to me . Lo , here it sits , Which God shall guard : and put the world 's whole strength Into one giant arm , it shall not force This lineal honour from me : this from thee Will I to mine leave , as ' tis left to me . Exit
KING HENRY IV : Warwick ! Gloucester ! Clarence ! Re-enter WARWICK , GLOUCESTER , CLARENCE , and the rest
CLARENCE : Doth the king call ?
WARWICK : What would your majesty ? How fares your grace ?
KING HENRY IV : Why did you leave me here alone , my lords ?
CLARENCE : We left the prince my brother here , my liege , Who undertook to sit and watch by you .
KING HENRY IV : The Prince of Wales ! Where is he ? let me see him : He is not here .
WARWICK : This door is open ; he is gone this way .
GLOUCESTER : He came not through the chamber where we stay 'd .
KING HENRY IV : Where is the crown ? who took it from my pillow ?
WARWICK : When we withdrew , my liege , we left it here .
KING HENRY IV : The prince hath ta 'en it hence : go , seek him out . Is he so hasty that he doth suppose My sleep my death ? Find him , my Lord of Warwick ; chide him hither . Exit WARWICK This part of his conjoins with my disease , And helps to end me . See , sons , what things you are ! How quickly nature falls into revolt When gold becomes her object ! For this the foolish over-careful fathers Have broke their sleep with thoughts , their brains with care , Their bones with industry ; For this they have engrossed and piled up The canker 'd heaps of strange-achieved gold ; For this they have been thoughtful to invest Their sons with arts and martial exercises : When , like the bee , culling from every flower The virtuous sweets , Our thighs pack 'd with wax , our mouths with honey , We bring it to the hive , and , like the bees , Are murdered for our pains . This bitter taste Yield his engrossments to the ending father . Re-enter WARWICK Now , where is he that will not stay so long Till his friend sickness hath determined me ?
WARWICK : My lord , I found the prince in the next room , Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks , With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow That tyranny , which never quaff 'd but blood , Would , by beholding him , have wash 'd his knife With gentle eye-drops . He is coming hither .
KING HENRY IV : But wherefore did he take away the crown ? Re-enter PRINCE HENRY Lo , where he comes . Come hither to me , Harry . Depart the chamber , leave us here alone .
