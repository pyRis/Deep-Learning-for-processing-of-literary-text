DAVY : Marry , sir , thus ; those precepts cannot be served : and , again , sir , shall we sow the headland with wheat ?
SHALLOW : With red wheat , Davy . But for William cook : are there no young pigeons ?
DAVY : Yes , sir . Here is now the smith 's note for shoeing and plough-irons .
SHALLOW : Let it be cast and paid . Sir John , you shall not be excused .
DAVY : Now , sir , a new link to the bucket must need be had : and , sir , do you mean to stop any of William 's wages , about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley fair ?
SHALLOW : A ' shall answer it . Some pigeons , Davy , a couple of short-legged hens , a joint of mutton , and any pretty little tiny kickshaws , tell William cook .
DAVY : Doth the man of war stay all night , sir ?
SHALLOW : Yea , Davy . I will use him well : a friend i ' the court is better than a penny in purse . Use his men well , Davy ; for they are arrant knaves , and will backbite .
DAVY : No worse than they are backbitten , sir ; for they have marvellous foul linen .
SHALLOW : Well conceited , Davy : about thy business , Davy .
DAVY : I beseech you , sir , to countenance William Visor of Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill .
SHALLOW : There is many complaints , Davy , against that Visor : that Visor is an arrant knave , on my knowledge .
DAVY : I grant your worship that he is a knave , sir ; but yet , God forbid , sir , but a knave should have some countenance at his friend 's request . An honest man , sir , is able to speak for himself , when a knave is not . I have served your worship truly , sir , this eight years ; and if I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man , I have but a very little credit with your worship . The knave is mine honest friend , sir ; therefore , I beseech your worship , let him be countenanced .
SHALLOW : Go to ; I say he shall have no wrong . Look about , Davy . Exit DAVY Where are you , Sir John ? Come , come , come , off with your boots . Give me your hand , Master Bardolph .
BARDOLPH : I am glad to see your worship .
SHALLOW : I thank thee with all my heart , kind Master Bardolph : and welcome , my tall fellow . To the Page Come , Sir John .
