FALSTAFF : How now ! whose mare 's dead ? what 's the matter ?
FANG : Sir John , I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly .
FALSTAFF : Away , varlets ! Draw , Bardolph : cut me off the villain 's head : throw the quean in the channel .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Throw me in the channel ! I 'll throw thee in the channel . Wilt thou ? wilt thou ? thou bastardly rogue ! Murder , murder ! Ah , thou honeysuckle villain ! wilt thou kill God 's officers and the king 's ? Ah , thou honey-seed rogue ! thou art a honey-seed , a man-queller , and a woman-queller .
FALSTAFF : Keep them off , Bardolph .
FANG : A rescue ! a rescue !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Good people , bring a rescue or two . Thou wo 't , wo 't thou ? Thou wo 't , wo 't ta ? do , do , thou rogue ! do , thou hemp-seed !
FALSTAFF : Away , you scullion ! you rampallion ! You fustilarian ! I 'll tickle your catastrophe . Enter the Lord Chief-Justice , and his men Lord Chief-Justice What is the matter ? keep the peace here , ho !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Good my lord , be good to me . I beseech you , stand to me . Lord Chief-Justice How now , Sir John ! what are you brawling here ? Doth this become your place , your time and business ? You should have been well on your way to York . Stand from him , fellow : wherefore hang 'st upon him ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : O most worshipful lord , an 't please your grace , I am a poor widow of Eastcheap , and he is arrested at my suit . Lord Chief-Justice For what sum ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : It is more than for some , my lord ; it is for all , all I have . He hath eaten me out of house and home ; he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his : but I will have some of it out again , or I will ride thee o ' nights like the mare .
FALSTAFF : I think I am as like to ride the mare , if I have any vantage of ground to get up . Lord Chief-Justice How comes this , Sir John ? Fie ! what man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation ? Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own ?
FALSTAFF : What is the gross sum that I owe thee ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Marry , if thou wert an honest man , thyself and the money too . Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet , sitting in my Dolphin-chamber , at the round table , by a sea-coal fire , upon Wednesday in Wheeson week , when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor , thou didst swear to me then , as I was washing thy wound , to marry me and make me my lady thy wife . Canst thou deny it ? Did not goodwife Keech , the butcher 's wife , come in then and call me gossip Quickly ? coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar ; telling us she had a good dish of prawns ; whereby thou didst desire to eat some ; whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound ? And didst thou not , when she was gone down stairs , desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people ; saying that ere long they should call me madam ? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings ? I put thee now to thy book-oath : deny it , if thou canst .
