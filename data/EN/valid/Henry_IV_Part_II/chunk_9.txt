MISTRESS QUICKLY : Yea , in truth , my lord . Lord Chief-Justice Pray thee , peace . Pay her the debt you owe her , and unpay the villany you have done her : the one you may do with sterling money , and the other with current repentance .
FALSTAFF : My lord , I will not undergo this sneap without reply . You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness : if a man will make courtesy and say nothing , he is virtuous : no , my lord , my humble duty remembered , I will not be your suitor . I say to you , I do desire deliverance from these officers , being upon hasty employment in the king 's affairs . Lord Chief-Justice You speak as having power to do wrong : but answer in the effect of your reputation , and satisfy this poor woman .
FALSTAFF : Come hither , hostess . Enter GOWER Lord Chief-Justice Now , Master Gower , what news ?
GOWER : The king , my lord , and Harry Prince of Wales Are near at hand : the rest the paper tells .
FALSTAFF : As I am a gentleman .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Faith , you said so before .
FALSTAFF : As I am a gentleman . Come , no more words of it .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : By this heavenly ground I tread on , I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers .
FALSTAFF : Glasses , glasses is the only drinking : and for thy walls , a pretty slight drollery , or the story of the Prodigal , or the German hunting in water-work , is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these fly-bitten tapestries . Let it be ten pound , if thou canst . Come , an ' twere not for thy humours , there 's not a better wench in England . Go , wash thy face , and draw the action . Come , thou must not be in this humour with me ; dost not know me ? come , come , I know thou wast set on to this .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Pray thee , Sir John , let it be but twenty nobles : i ' faith , I am loath to pawn my plate , so God save me , la !
FALSTAFF : Let it alone ; I 'll make other shift : you 'll be a fool still .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Well , you shall have it , though I pawn my gown . I hope you 'll come to supper . You 'll pay me all together ?
FALSTAFF : Will I live ? To BARDOLPH Go , with her , with her ; hook on , hook on .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper ?
FALSTAFF : No more words ; let 's have her . Lord Chief-Justice I have heard better news .
FALSTAFF : What 's the news , my lord ? Lord Chief-Justice Where lay the king last night ?
GOWER : At Basingstoke , my lord .
FALSTAFF : I hope , my lord , all 's well : what is the news , my lord ? Lord Chief-Justice Come all his forces back ?
GOWER : No ; fifteen hundred foot , five hundred horse , Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster , Against Northumberland and the Archbishop .
FALSTAFF : Comes the king back from Wales , my noble lord ? Lord Chief-Justice You shall have letters of me presently : Come , go along with me , good Master Gower .
FALSTAFF : My lord ! Lord Chief-Justice What 's the matter ?
FALSTAFF : Master Gower , shall I entreat you with me to dinner ?
GOWER : I must wait upon my good lord here ; I thank you , good Sir John . Lord Chief-Justice Sir John , you loiter here too long , being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go .
FALSTAFF : Will you sup with me , Master Gower ? Lord Chief-Justice What foolish master taught you these manners , Sir John ?
