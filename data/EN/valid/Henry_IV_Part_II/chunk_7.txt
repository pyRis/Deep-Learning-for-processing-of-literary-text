HASTINGS : Grant that our hopes , yet likely of fair birth , Should be still-born , and that we now possess 'd The utmost man of expectation , I think we are a body strong enough , Even as we are , to equal with the king .
LORD BARDOLPH : What , is the king but five and twenty thousand ?
HASTINGS : To us no more ; nay , not so much , Lord Bardolph . For his divisions , as the times do brawl , Are in three heads : one power against the French , And one against Glendower ; perforce a third Must take up us : so is the unfirm king In three divided ; and his coffers sound With hollow poverty and emptiness .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : That he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance , Need not be dreaded .
HASTINGS : If he should do so , He leaves his back unarm 'd , the French and Welsh Baying him at the heels : never fear that .
LORD BARDOLPH : Who is it like should lead his forces hither ?
HASTINGS : The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland ; Against the Welsh , himself and Harry Monmouth : But who is substituted ' gainst the French , I have no certain notice .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Let us on , And publish the occasion of our arms . The commonwealth is sick of their own choice ; Their over-greedy love hath surfeited : An habitation giddy and unsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart . O thou fond many , with what loud applause Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke , Before he was what thou wouldst have him be ! And being now trimm 'd in thine own desires , Thou , beastly feeder , art so full of him , That thou provokest thyself to cast him up . So , so , thou common dog , didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard ; And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up , And howl 'st to find it . What trust is in these times ? They that , when Richard lived , would have him die , Are now become enamour 'd on his grave : Thou , that threw 'st dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After the admired heels of Bolingbroke , Criest now ' O earth , yield us that king again , And take thou this ! ' O thoughts of men accursed ! Past and to come seems best ; things present worst .
MOWBRAY : Shall we go draw our numbers and set on ?
HASTINGS : We are time 's subjects , and time bids be gone . Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY , FANG and his Boy with her , and SNARE following .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Master Fang , have you entered the action ?
FANG : It is entered .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Where 's your yeoman ? Is 't a lusty yeoman ? will a ' stand to ' t ?
FANG : Sirrah , where 's Snare ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : O Lord , ay ! good Master Snare .
SNARE : Here , here .
FANG : Snare , we must arrest Sir John Falstaff .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Yea , good Master Snare ; I have entered him and all .
SNARE : It may chance cost some of us our lives , for he will stab .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Alas the day ! take heed of him ; he stabbed me in mine own house , and that most beastly : in good faith , he cares not what mischief he does . If his weapon be out : he will foin like any devil ; he will spare neither man , woman , nor child .
FANG : If I can close with him , I care not for his thrust .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : No , nor I neither : I 'll be at your elbow .
FANG : An I but fist him once ; an a ' come but within my vice , --
