KING HENRY IV : O my son , God put it in thy mind to take it hence , That thou mightst win the more thy father 's love , Pleading so wisely in excuse of it ! Come hither , Harry , sit thou by my bed ; And hear , I think , the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe . God knows , my son , By what by-paths and indirect crook 'd ways I met this crown ; and I myself know well How troublesome it sat upon my head . To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet , Better opinion , better confirmation ; For all the soil of the achievement goes With me into the earth . It seem 'd in me But as an honour snatch 'd with boisterous hand , And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances ; Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed , Wounding supposed peace : all these bold fears Thou see 'st with peril I have answered ; For all my reign hath been but as a scene Acting that argument : and now my death Changes the mode ; for what in me was purchased , Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort ; So thou the garland wear 'st successively . Yet , though thou stand 'st more sure than I could do , Thou art not firm enough , since griefs are green ; And all my friends , which thou must make thy friends , Have but their stings and teeth newly ta 'en out ; By whose fell working I was first advanced And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displaced : which to avoid , I cut them off ; and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land , Lest rest and lying still might make them look Too near unto my state . Therefore , my Harry , Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels ; that action , hence borne out , May waste the memory of the former days . More would I , but my lungs are wasted so That strength of speech is utterly denied me . How I came by the crown , O God forgive ; And grant it may with thee in true peace live !
PRINCE HENRY : My gracious liege , You won it , wore it , kept it , gave it me ; Then plain and right must my possession be : Which I with more than with a common pain ' Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain . Enter Lord John of LANCASTER
KING HENRY IV : Look , look , here comes my John of Lancaster .
LANCASTER : Health , peace , and happiness to my royal father !
KING HENRY IV : Thou bring 'st me happiness and peace , son John ; But health , alack , with youthful wings is flown From this bare wither 'd trunk : upon thy sight My worldly business makes a period . Where is my Lord of Warwick ?
PRINCE HENRY : My Lord of Warwick ! Enter WARWICK , and others
KING HENRY IV : Doth any name particular belong Unto the lodging where I first did swoon ?
WARWICK : ' Tis call 'd Jerusalem , my noble lord .
KING HENRY IV : Laud be to God ! even there my life must end . It hath been prophesied to me many years , I should not die but in Jerusalem ; Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land : But bear me to that chamber ; there I 'll lie ; In that Jerusalem shall Harry die . Enter SHALLOW , FALSTAFF , BARDOLPH , and Page
SHALLOW : By cock and pie , sir , you shall not away to-night . What , Davy , I say !
FALSTAFF : You must excuse me , Master Robert Shallow .
SHALLOW : I will not excuse you ; you shall not be excused ; excuses shall not be admitted ; there is no excuse shall serve ; you shall not be excused . Why , Davy ! Enter DAVY
DAVY : Here , sir .
