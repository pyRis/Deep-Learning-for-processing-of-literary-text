DOLL TEARSHEET : Captain ! thou abominable damned cheater , art thou not ashamed to be called captain ? An captains were of my mind , they would truncheon you out , for taking their names upon you before you have earned them . You a captain ! you slave , for what ? for tearing a poor whore 's ruff in a bawdy-house ? He a captain ! hang him , rogue ! he lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes . A captain ! God 's light , these villains will make the word as odious as the word ' occupy ; ' which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted : therefore captains had need look to ' t .

Shall we fall foul for toys ?

PISTOL : Then feed , and be fat , my fair Calipolis . Come , give 's some sack . ' Si fortune me tormente , sperato me contento .
