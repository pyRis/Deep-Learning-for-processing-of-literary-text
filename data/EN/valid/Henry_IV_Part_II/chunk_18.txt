PRINCE HENRY : By heaven , Poins , I feel me much to blame , So idly to profane the precious time , When tempest of commotion , like the south Borne with black vapour , doth begin to melt And drop upon our bare unarmed heads . Give me my sword and cloak . Falstaff , good night .
FALSTAFF : Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night , and we must hence and leave it unpicked . Knocking within More knocking at the door ! Re-enter BARDOLPH How now ! what 's the matter ?
BARDOLPH : You must away to court , sir , presently ; A dozen captains stay at door for you .
FALSTAFF : Pay the musicians , sirrah . Farewell , hostess ; farewell , Doll . You see , my good wenches , how men of merit are sought after : the undeserver may sleep , when the man of action is called on . Farewell good wenches : if I be not sent away post , I will see you again ere I go .
DOLL TEARSHEET : I cannot speak ; if my heart be not read to burst , -- well , sweet Jack , have a care of thyself .
FALSTAFF : Farewell , farewell .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Well , fare thee well : I have known thee these twenty-nine years , come peascod-time ; but an honester and truer-hearted man , --well , fare thee well .
BARDOLPH : Mistress Tearsheet !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : What 's the matter ?
BARDOLPH : Good Mistress Tearsheet , come to my master .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : O , run , Doll , run ; run , good Doll : come . She comes blubbered Yea , will you come , Doll ? Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown , with a Page
KING HENRY IV : Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick ; But , ere they come , bid them o 'er-read these letters , And well consider of them ; make good speed . Exit Page How many thousand of my poorest subjects Are at this hour asleep ! O sleep , O gentle sleep , Nature 's soft nurse , how have I frighted thee , That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down And steep my senses in forgetfulness ? Why rather , sleep , liest thou in smoky cribs , Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee And hush 'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber , Than in the perfumed chambers of the great , Under the canopies of costly state , And lull 'd with sound of sweetest melody ? O thou dull god , why liest thou with the vile In loathsome beds , and leavest the kingly couch A watch-case or a common ' larum-bell ? Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast Seal up the ship-boy 's eyes , and rock his brains In cradle of the rude imperious surge And in the visitation of the winds , Who take the ruffian billows by the top , Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds , That , with the hurly , death itself awakes ? Canst thou , O partial sleep , give thy repose To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude , And in the calmest and most stillest night , With all appliances and means to boot , Deny it to a king ? Then happy low , lie down ! Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown . Enter WARWICK and SURREY
WARWICK : Many good morrows to your majesty !
KING HENRY IV : Is it good morrow , lords ?
WARWICK : ' Tis one o 'clock , and past .
KING HENRY IV : Why , then , good morrow to you all , my lords . Have you read o 'er the letters that I sent you ?
WARWICK : We have , my liege .
KING HENRY IV : Then you perceive the body of our kingdom How foul it is ; what rank diseases grow And with what danger , near the heart of it .
WARWICK : It is but as a body yet distemper 'd ; Which to his former strength may be restored With good advice and little medicine : My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool 'd .
