LANCASTER : Thine 's too heavy to mount .
FALSTAFF : Let it shine , then .
LANCASTER : Thine 's too thick to shine .
FALSTAFF : Let it do something , my good lord , that may do me good , and call it what you will .
LANCASTER : Is thy name Colevile ?
COLEVILE : It is , my lord .
LANCASTER : A famous rebel art thou , Colevile .
FALSTAFF : And a famous true subject took him .
COLEVILE : I am , my lord , but as my betters are That led me hither : had they been ruled by me , You should have won them dearer than you have .
FALSTAFF : I know not how they sold themselves : but thou , like a kind fellow , gavest thyself away gratis ; and I thank thee for thee . Re-enter WESTMORELAND
LANCASTER : Now , have you left pursuit ?
WESTMORELAND : Retreat is made and execution stay 'd .
LANCASTER : Send Colevile with his confederates To York , to present execution : Blunt , lead him hence ; and see you guard him sure . And now dispatch we toward the court , my lords : I hear the king my father is sore sick : Our news shall go before us to his majesty , Which , cousin , you shall bear to comfort him , And we with sober speed will follow you .
FALSTAFF : My lord , I beseech you , give me leave to go Through Gloucestershire : and , when you come to court , Stand my good lord , pray , in your good report .
LANCASTER : Fare you well , Falstaff : I , in my condition , Shall better speak of you than you deserve .
FALSTAFF : I would you had but the wit : ' twere better than your dukedom . Good faith , this same young sober- blooded boy doth not love me ; nor a man cannot make him laugh ; but that 's no marvel , he drinks no wine . There 's never none of these demure boys come to any proof ; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood , and making many fish-meals , that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness ; and then when they marry , they get wenches : they are generally fools and cowards ; which some of us should be too , but for inflammation . A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it . It ascends me into the brain ; dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it ; makes it apprehensive , quick , forgetive , full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes , which , delivered o 'er to the voice , the tongue , which is the birth , becomes excellent wit . The second property of your excellent sherris is , the warming of the blood ; which , before cold and settled , left the liver white and pale , which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice ; but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme : it illumineth the face , which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom , man , to arm ; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain , the heart , who , great and puffed up with this retinue , doth any deed of courage ; and this valour comes of sherris . So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack , for that sets it a-work ; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil , till sack commences it and sets it in act and use . Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant ; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father , he hath , like lean , sterile and bare land , manured , husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris , that he is become very hot and valiant . If I had a thousand sons , the first humane principle I would teach them should be , to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack . Enter BARDOLPH How now Bardolph ?
BARDOLPH : The army is discharged all and gone .
