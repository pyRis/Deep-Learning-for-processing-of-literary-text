KING HENRY V : You are right , justice , and you weigh this well ; Therefore still bear the balance and the sword : And I do wish your honours may increase , Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you and obey you , as I did . So shall I live to speak my father 's words : ' Happy am I , that have a man so bold , That dares do justice on my proper son ; And not less happy , having such a son , That would deliver up his greatness so Into the hands of justice . ' You did commit me : For which , I do commit into your hand The unstained sword that you have used to bear ; With this remembrance , that you use the same With the like bold , just and impartial spirit As you have done ' gainst me . There is my hand . You shall be as a father to my youth : My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear , And I will stoop and humble my intents To your well-practised wise directions . And , princes all , believe me , I beseech you ; My father is gone wild into his grave , For in his tomb lie my affections ; And with his spirit sadly I survive , To mock the expectation of the world , To frustrate prophecies and to raze out Rotten opinion , who hath writ me down After my seeming . The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flow 'd in vanity till now : Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea , Where it shall mingle with the state of floods And flow henceforth in formal majesty . Now call we our high court of parliament : And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel , That the great body of our state may go In equal rank with the best govern 'd nation ; That war , or peace , or both at once , may be As things acquainted and familiar to us ; In which you , father , shall have foremost hand . Our coronation done , we will accite , As I before remember 'd , all our state : And , God consigning to my good intents , No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say , God shorten Harry 's happy life one day ! Enter FALSTAFF , SHALLOW , SILENCE , DAVY , BARDOLPH , and the Page
SHALLOW : Nay , you shall see my orchard , where , in an arbour , we will eat a last year 's pippin of my own graffing , with a dish of caraways , and so forth : come , cousin Silence : and then to bed .

SHALLOW : A good varlet , a good varlet , a very good varlet , Sir John : by the mass , I have drunk too much sack at supper : a good varlet . Now sit down , now sit down : come , cousin .
SILENCE : Ah , sirrah ! quoth-a , we shall Do nothing but eat , and make good cheer , Singing And praise God for the merry year ; When flesh is cheap and females dear , And lusty lads roam here and there So merrily , And ever among so merrily .
FALSTAFF : There 's a merry heart ! Good Master Silence , I 'll give you a health for that anon .
SHALLOW : Give Master Bardolph some wine , Davy .
DAVY : Sweet sir , sit ; I 'll be with you anon. most sweet sir , sit . Master page , good master page , sit . Proface ! What you want in meat , we 'll have in drink : but you must bear ; the heart 's all . Exit
