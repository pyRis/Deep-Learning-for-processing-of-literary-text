PRINCE HENRY : Before God , I am exceeding weary .
POINS : Is 't come to that ? I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood .
PRINCE HENRY : Faith , it does me ; though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it . Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer ?
POINS : Why , a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition .
PRINCE HENRY : Belike then my appetite was not princely got ; for , by my troth , I do now remember the poor creature , small beer . But , indeed , these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness . What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name ! or to know thy face to-morrow ! or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast , viz. these , and those that were thy peach-coloured ones ! or to bear the inventory of thy shirts , as , one for superfluity , and another for use ! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I ; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there ; as thou hast not done a great while , because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland : and God knows , whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom : but the midwives say the children are not in the fault ; whereupon the world increases , and kindreds are mightily strengthened .
POINS : How ill it follows , after you have laboured so hard , you should talk so idly ! Tell me , how many good young princes would do so , their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is ?
PRINCE HENRY : Shall I tell thee one thing , Poins ?
POINS : Yes , faith ; and let it be an excellent good thing .
PRINCE HENRY : It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine .
POINS : Go to ; I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell .
PRINCE HENRY : Marry , I tell thee , it is not meet that I should be sad , now my father is sick : albeit I could tell thee , as to one it pleases me , for fault of a better , to call my friend , I could be sad , and sad indeed too .
POINS : Very hardly upon such a subject .
PRINCE HENRY : By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil 's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency : let the end try the man . But I tell thee , my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick : and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow .
POINS : The reason ?
PRINCE HENRY : What wouldst thou think of me , if I should weep ?
POINS : I would think thee a most princely hypocrite .
PRINCE HENRY : It would be every man 's thought ; and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks : never a man 's thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine : every man would think me an hypocrite indeed . And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so ?
POINS : Why , because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff .
PRINCE HENRY : And to thee .
POINS : By this light , I am well spoke on ; I can hear it with my own ears : the worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands ; and those two things , I confess , I cannot help . By the mass , here comes Bardolph . Enter BARDOLPH and Page
PRINCE HENRY : And the boy that I gave Falstaff : a ' had him from me Christian ; and look , if the fat villain have not transformed him ape .
BARDOLPH : God save your grace !
PRINCE HENRY : And yours , most noble Bardolph !
