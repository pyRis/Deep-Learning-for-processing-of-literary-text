SHALLOW : By the mass , I could anger her to the heart . She was then a bona-roba . Doth she hold her own well ?
FALSTAFF : Old , old , Master Shallow .
SHALLOW : Nay , she must be old ; she cannot choose but be old ; certain she 's old ; and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement 's Inn .
SILENCE : That 's fifty-five year ago .
SHALLOW : Ha , cousin Silence , that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have seen ! Ha , Sir John , said I well ?
FALSTAFF : We have heard the chimes at midnight , Master Shallow .
SHALLOW : That we have , that we have , that we have ; in faith , Sir John , we have : our watch-word was ' Hem boys ! ' Come , let 's to dinner ; come , let 's to dinner : Jesus , the days that we have seen ! Come , come .
BULLCALF : Good Master Corporate Bardolph , stand my friend ; and here 's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you . In very truth , sir , I had as lief be hanged , sir , as go : and yet , for mine own part , sir , I do not care ; but rather , because I am unwilling , and , for mine own part , have a desire to stay with my friends ; else , sir , I did not care , for mine own part , so much .
BARDOLPH : Go to ; stand aside .
MOULDY : And , good master corporal captain , for my old dame 's sake , stand my friend : she has nobody to do any thing about her when I am gone ; and she is old , and cannot help herself : You shall have forty , sir .
BARDOLPH : Go to ; stand aside .
FEEBLE : By my troth , I care not ; a man can die but once : we owe God a death : I 'll ne 'er bear a base mind : an 't be my destiny , so ; an 't be not , so : no man is too good to serve 's prince ; and let it go which way it will , he that dies this year is quit for the next .
BARDOLPH : Well said ; thou 'rt a good fellow .
FEEBLE : Faith , I 'll bear no base mind . Re-enter FALSTAFF and the Justices
FALSTAFF : Come , sir , which men shall I have ?
SHALLOW : Four of which you please .
BARDOLPH : Sir , a word with you : I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf .
FALSTAFF : Go to ; well .
SHALLOW : Come , Sir John , which four will you have ?
FALSTAFF : Do you choose for me .
SHALLOW : Marry , then , Mouldy , Bullcalf , Feeble and Shadow .
FALSTAFF : Mouldy and Bullcalf : for you , Mouldy , stay at home till you are past service : and for your part , Bullcalf , grow till you come unto it : I will none of you .
SHALLOW : Sir John , Sir John , do not yourself wrong : they are your likeliest men , and I would have you served with the best .
FALSTAFF : Will you tell me , Master Shallow , how to choose a man ? Care I for the limb , the thewes , the stature , bulk , and big assemblance of a man ! Give me the spirit , Master Shallow . Here 's Wart ; you see what a ragged appearance it is ; a ' shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer 's hammer , come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer 's bucket . And this same half-faced fellow , Shadow ; give me this man : he presents no mark to the enemy ; the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife . And for a retreat ; how swiftly will this Feeble the woman 's tailor run off ! O , give me the spare men , and spare me the great ones . Put me a caliver into Wart 's hand , Bardolph .
