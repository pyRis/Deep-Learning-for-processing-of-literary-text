FALSTAFF : What , is the old king dead ?
PISTOL : As nail in door : the things I speak are just .
FALSTAFF : Away , Bardolph ! saddle my horse . Master Robert Shallow , choose what office thou wilt in the land , ' tis thine . Pistol , I will double-charge thee with dignities .
BARDOLPH : O joyful day ! I would not take a knighthood for my fortune .
PISTOL : What ! I do bring good news .
FALSTAFF : Carry Master Silence to bed . Master Shallow , my Lord Shallow , --be what thou wilt ; I am fortune 's steward--get on thy boots : we 'll ride all night . O sweet Pistol ! Away , Bardolph ! Exit BARDOLPH Come , Pistol , utter more to me ; and withal devise something to do thyself good . Boot , boot , Master Shallow : I know the young king is sick for me . Let us take any man 's horses ; the laws of England are at my commandment . Blessed are they that have been my friends ; and woe to my lord chief-justice !

MISTRESS QUICKLY : O the Lord , that Sir John were come ! he would make this a bloody day to somebody . But I pray God the fruit of her womb miscarry !
First Beadle : If it do , you shall have a dozen of cushions again ; you have but eleven now . Come , I charge you both go with me ; for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you .
DOLL TEARSHEET : I 'll tell you what , you thin man in a censer , I will have you as soundly swinged for this , --you blue-bottle rogue , you filthy famished correctioner , if you be not swinged , I 'll forswear half-kirtles .
First Beadle : Come , come , you she knight-errant , come .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : O God , that right should thus overcome might ! Well , of sufferance comes ease .
DOLL TEARSHEET : Come , you rogue , come ; bring me to a justice .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Ay , come , you starved blood-hound .

PISTOL : God bless thy lungs , good knight .
FALSTAFF : Come here , Pistol ; stand behind me . O , if I had had time to have made new liveries , I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you . But ' tis no matter ; this poor show doth better : this doth infer the zeal I had to see him .
SHALLOW : It doth so .
FALSTAFF : It shows my earnestness of affection , --
