PRINCE HENRY : Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull . Shall we steal upon them , Ned , at supper ?
POINS : I am your shadow , my lord ; I 'll follow you .
PRINCE HENRY : Sirrah , you boy , and Bardolph , no word to your master that I am yet come to town : there 's for your silence .
BARDOLPH : I have no tongue , sir .
Page : And for mine , sir , I will govern it .
PRINCE HENRY : Fare you well ; go . This Doll Tearsheet should be some road .
POINS : I warrant you , as common as the way between Saint Alban 's and London .
PRINCE HENRY : How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night in his true colours , and not ourselves be seen ?
POINS : Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons , and wait upon him at his table as drawers .
PRINCE HENRY : From a God to a bull ? a heavy decension ! it was Jove 's case . From a prince to a prentice ? a low transformation ! that shall be mine ; for in every thing the purpose must weigh with the folly . Follow me , Ned . Enter NORTHUMBERLAND , LADY NORTHUMBERLAND , and LADY PERCY
NORTHUMBERLAND : I pray thee , loving wife , and gentle daughter , Give even way unto my rough affairs : Put not you on the visage of the times And be like them to Percy troublesome . LADY
NORTHUMBERLAND : I have given over , I will speak no more : Do what you will ; your wisdom be your guide .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Alas , sweet wife , my honour is at pawn ; And , but my going , nothing can redeem it .
LADY PERCY : O yet , for God 's sake , go not to these wars ! The time was , father , that you broke your word , When you were more endeared to it than now ; When your own Percy , when my heart 's dear Harry , Threw many a northward look to see his father Bring up his powers ; but he did long in vain . Who then persuaded you to stay at home ? There were two honours lost , yours and your son 's . For yours , the God of heaven brighten it ! For his , it stuck upon him as the sun In the grey vault of heaven , and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts : he was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves : He had no legs that practised not his gait ; And speaking thick , which nature made his blemish , Became the accents of the valiant ; For those that could speak low and tardily Would turn their own perfection to abuse , To seem like him : so that in speech , in gait , In diet , in affections of delight , In military rules , humours of blood , He was the mark and glass , copy and book , That fashion 'd others . And him , O wondrous him ! O miracle of men ! him did you leave , Second to none , unseconded by you , To look upon the hideous god of war In disadvantage ; to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur 's name Did seem defensible : so you left him . Never , O never , do his ghost the wrong To hold your honour more precise and nice With others than with him ! let them alone : The marshal and the archbishop are strong : Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers , To-day might I , hanging on Hotspur 's neck , Have talk 'd of Monmouth 's grave .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Beshrew your heart , Fair daughter , you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights . But I must go and meet with danger there , Or it will seek me in another place And find me worse provided . LADY
NORTHUMBERLAND : O , fly to Scotland , Till that the nobles and the armed commons Have of their puissance made a little taste .
