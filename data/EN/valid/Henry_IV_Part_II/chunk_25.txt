WESTMORELAND : When ever yet was your appeal denied ? Wherein have you been galled by the king ? What peer hath been suborn 'd to grate on you , That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forged rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotion 's bitter edge ?
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : My brother general , the commonwealth , To brother born an household cruelty , I make my quarrel in particular .
WESTMORELAND : There is no need of any such redress ; Or if there were , it not belongs to you .
MOWBRAY : Why not to him in part , and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before , And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honours ?
WESTMORELAND : O , my good Lord Mowbray , Construe the times to their necessities , And you shall say indeed , it is the time , And not the king , that doth you injuries . Yet for your part , it not appears to me Either from the king or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on : were you not restored To all the Duke of Norfolk 's signories , Your noble and right well remember 'd father 's ?
MOWBRAY : What thing , in honour , had my father lost , That need to be revived and breathed in me ? The king that loved him , as the state stood then , Was force perforce compell 'd to banish him : And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he , Being mounted and both roused in their seats , Their neighing coursers daring of the spur , Their armed staves in charge , their beavers down , Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together , Then , then , when there was nothing could have stay 'd My father from the breast of Bolingbroke , O when the king did throw his warder down , His own life hung upon the staff he threw ; Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke .
WESTMORELAND : You speak , Lord Mowbray , now you know not what . The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentlemen : Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled ? But if your father had been victor there , He ne 'er had borne it out of Coventry : For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him ; and all their prayers and love Were set on Hereford , whom they doted on And bless 'd and graced indeed , more than the king . But this is mere digression from my purpose . Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs ; to tell you from his grace That he will give you audience ; and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just , You shall enjoy them , every thing set off That might so much as think you enemies .
MOWBRAY : But he hath forced us to compel this offer ; And it proceeds from policy , not love .
WESTMORELAND : Mowbray , you overween to take it so ; This offer comes from mercy , not from fear : For , lo ! within a ken our army lies , Upon mine honour , all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear . Our battle is more full of names than yours , Our men more perfect in the use of arms , Our armour all as strong , our cause the best ; Then reason will our heart should be as good Say you not then our offer is compell 'd .
MOWBRAY : Well , by my will we shall admit no parley .
WESTMORELAND : That argues but the shame of your offence : A rotten case abides no handling .
HASTINGS : Hath the Prince John a full commission , In very ample virtue of his father , To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon ?
WESTMORELAND : That is intended in the general 's name : I muse you make so slight a question .
