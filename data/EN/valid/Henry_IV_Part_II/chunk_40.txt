FALSTAFF : My devotion , --
SHALLOW : It doth , it doth , it doth .
FALSTAFF : As it were , to ride day and night ; and not to deliberate , not to remember , not to have patience to shift me , --
SHALLOW : It is best , certain .
FALSTAFF : But to stand stained with travel , and sweating with desire to see him ; thinking of nothing else , putting all affairs else in oblivion , as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him .
PISTOL : ' Tis ' semper idem , ' for ' obsque hoc nihil est : ' ' tis all in every part .
SHALLOW : ' Tis so , indeed .
PISTOL : My knight , I will inflame thy noble liver , And make thee rage . Thy Doll , and Helen of thy noble thoughts , Is in base durance and contagious prison ; Haled thither By most mechanical and dirty hand : Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto 's snake , For Doll is in . Pistol speaks nought but truth .
FALSTAFF : I will deliver her . Shouts within , and the trumpets sound
PISTOL : There roar 'd the sea , and trumpet-clangor sounds . Enter KING HENRY V and his train , the Lord Chief- Justice among them
FALSTAFF : God save thy grace , King Hal ! my royal Hal !
PISTOL : The heavens thee guard and keep , most royal imp of fame !
FALSTAFF : God save thee , my sweet boy !
KING HENRY IV : My lord chief-justice , speak to that vain man . Lord Chief-Justice Have you your wits ? know you what ' tis to speak ?
FALSTAFF : My king ! my Jove ! I speak to thee , my heart !
KING HENRY IV : I know thee not , old man : fall to thy prayers ; How ill white hairs become a fool and jester ! I have long dream 'd of such a kind of man , So surfeit-swell 'd , so old and so profane ; But , being awaked , I do despise my dream . Make less thy body hence , and more thy grace ; Leave gormandizing ; know the grave doth gape For thee thrice wider than for other men . Reply not to me with a fool-born jest : Presume not that I am the thing I was ; For God doth know , so shall the world perceive , That I have turn 'd away my former self ; So will I those that kept me company . When thou dost hear I am as I have been , Approach me , and thou shalt be as thou wast , The tutor and the feeder of my riots : Till then , I banish thee , on pain of death , As I have done the rest of my misleaders , Not to come near our person by ten mile . For competence of life I will allow you , That lack of means enforce you not to evil : And , as we hear you do reform yourselves , We will , according to your strengths and qualities , Give you advancement . Be it your charge , my lord , To see perform 'd the tenor of our word . Set on .
FALSTAFF : Master Shallow , I owe you a thousand pound .
SHALLOW : Yea , marry , Sir John ; which I beseech you to let me have home with me .
FALSTAFF : That can hardly be , Master Shallow . Do not you grieve at this ; I shall be sent for in private to him : look you , he must seem thus to the world : fear not your advancements ; I will be the man yet that shall make you great .
SHALLOW : I cannot well perceive how , unless you should give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw . I beseech you , good Sir John , let me have five hundred of my thousand .
FALSTAFF : Sir , I will be as good as my word : this that you heard was but a colour .
SHALLOW : A colour that I fear you will die in , Sir John .
