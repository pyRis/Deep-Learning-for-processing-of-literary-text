RUMOUR : Open your ears ; for which of you will stop The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks ? I , from the orient to the drooping west , Making the wind my post-horse , still unfold The acts commenced on this ball of earth : Upon my tongues continual slanders ride , The which in every language I pronounce , Stuffing the ears of men with false reports . I speak of peace , while covert enmity Under the smile of safety wounds the world : And who but Rumour , who but only I , Make fearful musters and prepared defence , Whiles the big year , swoln with some other grief , Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war , And no such matter ? Rumour is a pipe Blown by surmises , jealousies , conjectures And of so easy and so plain a stop That the blunt monster with uncounted heads , The still-discordant wavering multitude , Can play upon it . But what need I thus My well-known body to anatomize Among my household ? Why is Rumour here ? I run before King Harry 's victory ; Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops , Quenching the flame of bold rebellion Even with the rebel 's blood . But what mean I To speak so true at first ? my office is To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell Under the wrath of noble Hotspur 's sword , And that the king before the Douglas ' rage Stoop 'd his anointed head as low as death . This have I rumour 'd through the peasant towns Between that royal field of Shrewsbury And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone , Where Hotspur 's father , old Northumberland , Lies crafty-sick : the posts come tiring on , And not a man of them brings other news Than they have learn 'd of me : from Rumour 's tongues They bring smooth comforts false , worse than true wrongs . Exit Enter LORD BARDOLPH
LORD BARDOLPH : Who keeps the gate here , ho ? The Porter opens the gate Where is the earl ?
Porter : What shall I say you are ?
LORD BARDOLPH : Tell thou the earl That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here .
Porter : His lordship is walk 'd forth into the orchard ; Please it your honour , knock but at the gate , And he himself wilt answer . Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
LORD BARDOLPH : Here comes the earl . Exit Porter
NORTHUMBERLAND : What news , Lord Bardolph ? every minute now Should be the father of some stratagem : The times are wild : contention , like a horse Full of high feeding , madly hath broke loose And bears down all before him .
LORD BARDOLPH : Noble earl , I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Good , an God will !
LORD BARDOLPH : As good as heart can wish : The king is almost wounded to the death ; And , in the fortune of my lord your son , Prince Harry slain outright ; and both the Blunts Kill 'd by the hand of Douglas ; young Prince John And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field ; And Harry Monmouth 's brawn , the hulk Sir John , Is prisoner to your son : O , such a day , So fought , so follow 'd and so fairly won , Came not till now to dignify the times , Since Caesar 's fortunes !
NORTHUMBERLAND : How is this derived ? Saw you the field ? came you from Shrewsbury ?
LORD BARDOLPH : I spake with one , my lord , that came from thence , A gentleman well bred and of good name , That freely render 'd me these news for true .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Here comes my servant Travers , whom I sent On Tuesday last to listen after news . Enter TRAVERS
LORD BARDOLPH : My lord , I over-rode him on the way ; And he is furnish 'd with no certainties More than he haply may retail from me .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Now , Travers , what good tidings comes with you ?
