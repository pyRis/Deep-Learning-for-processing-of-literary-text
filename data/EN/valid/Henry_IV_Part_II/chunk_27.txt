ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Good my Lord of Lancaster , I am not here against your father 's peace ; But , as I told my lord of Westmoreland , The time misorder 'd doth , in common sense , Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form , To hold our safety up . I sent your grace The parcels and particulars of our grief , The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court , Whereon this Hydra son of war is born ; Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm 'd asleep With grant of our most just and right desires , And true obedience , of this madness cured , Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty .
MOWBRAY : If not , we ready are to try our fortunes To the last man .
HASTINGS : And though we here fall down , We have supplies to second our attempt : If they miscarry , theirs shall second them ; And so success of mischief shall be born And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up Whiles England shall have generation .
LANCASTER : You are too shallow , Hastings , much too shallow , To sound the bottom of the after-times .
WESTMORELAND : Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articles .
LANCASTER : I like them all , and do allow them well , And swear here , by the honour of my blood , My father 's purposes have been mistook , And some about him have too lavishly Wrested his meaning and authority . My lord , these griefs shall be with speed redress 'd ; Upon my soul , they shall . If this may please you , Discharge your powers unto their several counties , As we will ours : and here between the armies Let 's drink together friendly and embrace , That all their eyes may bear those tokens home Of our restored love and amity .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : I take your princely word for these redresses .
LANCASTER : I give it you , and will maintain my word : And thereupon I drink unto your grace .
HASTINGS : Go , captain , and deliver to the army This news of peace : let them have pay , and part : I know it will well please them . Hie thee , captain . Exit Officer
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : To you , my noble Lord of Westmoreland .
WESTMORELAND : I pledge your grace ; and , if you knew what pains I have bestow 'd to breed this present peace , You would drink freely : but my love to ye Shall show itself more openly hereafter .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : I do not doubt you .
WESTMORELAND : I am glad of it . Health to my lord and gentle cousin , Mowbray .
MOWBRAY : You wish me health in very happy season ; For I am , on the sudden , something ill .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Against ill chances men are ever merry ; But heaviness foreruns the good event .
WESTMORELAND : Therefore be merry , coz ; since sudden sorrow Serves to say thus , ' some good thing comes to-morrow . ' 
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Believe me , I am passing light in spirit .
MOWBRAY : So much the worse , if your own rule be true . Shouts within
LANCASTER : The word of peace is render 'd : hark , how they shout !
MOWBRAY : This had been cheerful after victory .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : A peace is of the nature of a conquest ; For then both parties nobly are subdued , And neither party loser .
LANCASTER : Go , my lord , And let our army be discharged too . Exit WESTMORELAND And , good my lord , so please you , let our trains March , by us , that we may peruse the men We should have coped withal .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Go , good Lord Hastings , And , ere they be dismissed , let them march by . Exit HASTINGS
LANCASTER : I trust , lords , we shall lie to-night together . Re-enter WESTMORELAND Now , cousin , wherefore stands our army still ?
WESTMORELAND : The leaders , having charge from you to stand , Will not go off until they hear you speak .
