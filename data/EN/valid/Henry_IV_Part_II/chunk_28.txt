HASTINGS : My lord , our army is dispersed already ; Like youthful steers unyoked , they take their courses East , west , north , south ; or , like a school broke up , Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place .
WESTMORELAND : Good tidings , my Lord Hastings ; for the which I do arrest thee , traitor , of high treason : And you , lord archbishop , and you , Lord Mowbray , Of capitol treason I attach you both .
MOWBRAY : Is this proceeding just and honourable ?
WESTMORELAND : Is your assembly so ?
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Will you thus break your faith ?
LANCASTER : I pawn 'd thee none : I promised you redress of these same grievances Whereof you did complain ; which , by mine honour , I will perform with a most Christian care . But for you , rebels , look to taste the due Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours . Most shallowly did you these arms commence , Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence . Strike up our drums , pursue the scatter 'd stray : God , and not we , hath safely fought to-day . Some guard these traitors to the block of death , Treason 's true bed and yielder up of breath . Alarum . Excursions . Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE , meeting
FALSTAFF : What 's your name , sir ? of what condition are you , and of what place , I pray ?
COLEVILE : I am a knight , sir , and my name is Colevile of the dale .
FALSTAFF : Well , then , Colevile is your name , a knight is your degree , and your place the dale : Colevile shall be still your name , a traitor your degree , and the dungeon your place , a place deep enough ; so shall you be still Colevile of the dale .
COLEVILE : Are not you Sir John Falstaff ?
FALSTAFF : As good a man as he , sir , whoe 'er I am . Do ye yield , sir ? or shall I sweat for you ? if I do sweat , they are the drops of thy lovers , and they weep for thy death : therefore rouse up fear and trembling , and do observance to my mercy .
COLEVILE : I think you are Sir John Falstaff , and in that thought yield me .
FALSTAFF : I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine , and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name . An I had but a belly of any indifference , I were simply the most active fellow in Europe : my womb , my womb , my womb , undoes me . Here comes our general . Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER , WESTMORELAND , BLUNT , and others
LANCASTER : The heat is past ; follow no further now : Call in the powers , good cousin Westmoreland . Exit WESTMORELAND Now , Falstaff , where have you been all this while ? When every thing is ended , then you come : These tardy tricks of yours will , on my life , One time or other break some gallows ' back .
FALSTAFF : I would be sorry , my lord , but it should be thus : I never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward of valour . Do you think me a swallow , an arrow , or a bullet ? have I , in my poor and old motion , the expedition of thought ? I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility ; I have foundered nine score and odd posts : and here , travel-tainted as I am , have in my pure and immaculate valour , taken Sir John Colevile of the dale , a most furious knight and valorous enemy . But what of that ? he saw me , and yielded ; that I may justly say , with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome , ' I came , saw , and overcame . ' 
LANCASTER : It was more of his courtesy than your deserving .
