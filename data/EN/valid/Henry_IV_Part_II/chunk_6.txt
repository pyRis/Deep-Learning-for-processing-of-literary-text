FALSTAFF : Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth ? Lord Chief-Justice Not a penny , not a penny ; you are too impatient to bear crosses . Fare you well : commend me to my cousin Westmoreland .
FALSTAFF : If I do , fillip me with a three-man beetle . A man can no more separate age and covetousness than a ' can part young limbs and lechery : but the gout galls the one , and the pox pinches the other ; and so both the degrees prevent my curses . Boy !
Page : Sir ?
FALSTAFF : What money is in my purse ?
Page : Seven groats and two pence .
FALSTAFF : I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse : borrowing only lingers and lingers it out , but the disease is incurable . Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster ; this to the prince ; this to the Earl of Westmoreland ; and this to old Mistress Ursula , whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair on my chin . About it : you know where to find me . Exit Page A pox of this gout ! or , a gout of this pox ! for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe . ' Tis no matter if I do halt ; I have the wars for my colour , and my pension shall seem the more reasonable . A good wit will make use of any thing : I will turn diseases to commodity . Exit Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK , the Lords HASTINGS , MOWBRAY , and BARDOLPH
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Thus have you heard our cause and known our means ; And , my most noble friends , I pray you all , Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes : And first , lord marshal , what say you to it ?
MOWBRAY : I well allow the occasion of our arms ; But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the king .
HASTINGS : Our present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice ; And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland , whose bosom burns With an incensed fire of injuries .
LORD BARDOLPH : The question then , Lord Hastings , standeth thus ; Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland ?
HASTINGS : With him , we may .
LORD BARDOLPH : Yea , marry , there 's the point : But if without him we be thought too feeble , My judgment is , we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand ; For in a theme so bloody-faced as this Conjecture , expectation , and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : ' Tis very true , Lord Bardolph ; for indeed It was young Hotspur 's case at Shrewsbury .
LORD BARDOLPH : It was , my lord ; who lined himself with hope , Eating the air on promise of supply , Flattering himself in project of a power Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts : And so , with great imagination Proper to madmen , led his powers to death And winking leap 'd into destruction .
HASTINGS : But , by your leave , it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope .
