Servant : Sir John !
FALSTAFF : What ! a young knave , and begging ! Is there not wars ? is there not employment ? doth not the king lack subjects ? do not the rebels need soldiers ? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one , it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side , were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it .
Servant : You mistake me , sir .
FALSTAFF : Why , sir , did I say you were an honest man ? setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside , I had lied in my throat , if I had said so .
Servant : I pray you , sir , then set your knighthood and our soldiership aside ; and give me leave to tell you , you lie in your throat , if you say I am any other than an honest man .
FALSTAFF : I give thee leave to tell me so ! I lay aside that which grows to me ! if thou gettest any leave of me , hang me ; if thou takest leave , thou wert better be hanged . You hunt counter : hence ! avaunt !
Servant : Sir , my lord would speak with you . Lord Chief-Justice Sir John Falstaff , a word with you .
FALSTAFF : My good lord ! God give your lordship good time of day . I am glad to see your lordship abroad : I heard say your lordship was sick : I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice . Your lordship , though not clean past your youth , hath yet some smack of age in you , some relish of the saltness of time ; and I must humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care of your health . Lord Chief-Justice Sir John , I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury .
FALSTAFF : An 't please your lordship , I hear his majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales . Lord Chief-Justice I talk not of his majesty : you would not come when I sent for you .
FALSTAFF : And I hear , moreover , his highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy . Lord Chief-Justice Well , God mend him ! I pray you , let me speak with you .
FALSTAFF : This apoplexy is , as I take it , a kind of lethargy , an 't please your lordship ; a kind of sleeping in the blood , a whoreson tingling . Lord Chief-Justice What tell you me of it ? be it as it is .
FALSTAFF : It hath its original from much grief , from study and perturbation of the brain : I have read the cause of his effects in Galen : it is a kind of deafness . Lord Chief-Justice I think you are fallen into the disease ; for you hear not what I say to you .
FALSTAFF : Very well , my lord , very well : rather , an 't please you , it is the disease of not listening , the malady of not marking , that I am troubled withal . Lord Chief-Justice To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears ; and I care not if I do become your physician .
FALSTAFF : I am as poor as Job , my lord , but not so patient : your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty ; but how should I be your patient to follow your prescriptions , the wise may make some dram of a scruple , or indeed a scruple itself . Lord Chief-Justice I sent for you , when there were matters against you for your life , to come speak with me .
FALSTAFF : As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service , I did not come . Lord Chief-Justice Well , the truth is , Sir John , you live in great infamy .
FALSTAFF : He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less . Lord Chief-Justice Your means are very slender , and your waste is great .
FALSTAFF : I would it were otherwise ; I would my means were greater , and my waist slenderer . Lord Chief-Justice You have misled the youthful prince .
