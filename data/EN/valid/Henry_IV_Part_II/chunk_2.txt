NORTHUMBERLAND : For this I shall have time enough to mourn . In poison there is physic ; and these news , Having been well , that would have made me sick , Being sick , have in some measure made me well : And as the wretch , whose fever-weaken 'd joints , Like strengthless hinges , buckle under life , Impatient of his fit , breaks like a fire Out of his keeper 's arms , even so my limbs , Weaken 'd with grief , being now enraged with grief , Are thrice themselves . Hence , therefore , thou nice crutch ! A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel Must glove this hand : and hence , thou sickly quoif ! Thou art a guard too wanton for the head Which princes , flesh 'd with conquest , aim to hit . Now bind my brows with iron ; and approach The ragged 'st hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon the enraged Northumberland ! Let heaven kiss earth ! now let not Nature 's hand Keep the wild flood confined ! let order die ! And let this world no longer be a stage To feed contention in a lingering act ; But let one spirit of the first-born Cain Reign in all bosoms , that , each heart being set On bloody courses , the rude scene may end , And darkness be the burier of the dead !
TRAVERS : This strained passion doth you wrong , my lord .
LORD BARDOLPH : Sweet earl , divorce not wisdom from your honour .
MORTON : The lives of all your loving complices Lean on your health ; the which , if you give o 'er To stormy passion , must perforce decay . You cast the event of war , my noble lord , And summ 'd the account of chance , before you said ' Let us make head . ' It was your presurmise , That , in the dole of blows , your son might drop : You knew he walk 'd o 'er perils , on an edge , More likely to fall in than to get o 'er ; You were advised his flesh was capable Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged : Yet did you say ' Go forth ; ' and none of this , Though strongly apprehended , could restrain The stiff-borne action : what hath then befallen , Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth , More than that being which was like to be ?
LORD BARDOLPH : We all that are engaged to this loss Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought our life ' twas ten to one ; And yet we ventured , for the gain proposed Choked the respect of likely peril fear 'd ; And since we are o 'erset , venture again . Come , we will all put forth , body and goods .
MORTON : ' Tis more than time : and , my most noble lord , I hear for certain , and do speak the truth , The gentle Archbishop of York is up With well-appointed powers : he is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers . My lord your son had only but the corpse , But shadows and the shows of men , to fight ; For that same word , rebellion , did divide The action of their bodies from their souls ; And they did fight with queasiness , constrain 'd , As men drink potions , that their weapons only Seem 'd on our side ; but , for their spirits and souls , This word , rebellion , it had froze them up , As fish are in a pond . But now the bishop Turns insurrection to religion : Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts , He 's followed both with body and with mind ; And doth enlarge his rising with the blood Of fair King Richard , scraped from Pomfret stones ; Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause ; Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land , Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke ; And more and less do flock to follow him .
