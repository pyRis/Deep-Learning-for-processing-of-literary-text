FALSTAFF : Have you turned him out o ' doors ?
BARDOLPH : Yea , sir . The rascal 's drunk : you have hurt him , sir , i ' the shoulder .
FALSTAFF : A rascal ! to brave me !
DOLL TEARSHEET : Ah , you sweet little rogue , you ! alas , poor ape , how thou sweatest ! come , let me wipe thy face ; come on , you whoreson chops : ah , rogue ! i 'faith , I love thee : thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy , worth five of Agamemnon , and ten times better than the Nine Worthies : ah , villain !
FALSTAFF : A rascally slave ! I will toss the rogue in a blanket .
DOLL TEARSHEET : Do , an thou darest for thy heart : an thou dost , I 'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets . Enter Music
Page : The music is come , sir .
FALSTAFF : Let them play . Play , sirs . Sit on my knee , Doll . A rascal bragging slave ! the rogue fled from me like quicksilver .
DOLL TEARSHEET : I ' faith , and thou followedst him like a church . Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig , when wilt thou leave fighting o ' days and foining o ' nights , and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven ? Enter , behind , PRINCE HENRY and POINS , disguised
FALSTAFF : Peace , good Doll ! do not speak like a death 's-head ; do not bid me remember mine end .
DOLL TEARSHEET : Sirrah , what humour 's the prince of ?
FALSTAFF : A good shallow young fellow : a ' would have made a good pantler , a ' would ha ' chipp 'd bread well .
DOLL TEARSHEET : They say Poins has a good wit .
FALSTAFF : He a good wit ? hang him , baboon ! his wit 's as thick as Tewksbury mustard ; there 's no more conceit in him than is in a mallet .
DOLL TEARSHEET : Why does the prince love him so , then ?
FALSTAFF : Because their legs are both of a bigness , and a ' plays at quoits well , and eats conger and fennel , and drinks off candles ' ends for flap-dragons , and rides the wild-mare with the boys , and jumps upon joined-stools , and swears with a good grace , and wears his boots very smooth , like unto the sign of the leg , and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories ; and such other gambol faculties a ' has , that show a weak mind and an able body , for the which the prince admits him : for the prince himself is such another ; the weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois .
PRINCE HENRY : Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off ?
POINS : Let 's beat him before his whore .
PRINCE HENRY : Look , whether the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot .
POINS : Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance ?
FALSTAFF : Kiss me , Doll .
PRINCE HENRY : Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction ! what says the almanac to that ?
POINS : And look , whether the fiery Trigon , his man , be not lisping to his master 's old tables , his note-book , his counsel-keeper .
FALSTAFF : Thou dost give me flattering busses .
DOLL TEARSHEET : By my troth , I kiss thee with a most constant heart .
FALSTAFF : I am old , I am old .
DOLL TEARSHEET : I love thee better than I love e 'er a scurvy young boy of them all .
FALSTAFF : What stuff wilt have a kirtle of ? I shall receive money o ' Thursday : shalt have a cap to-morrow . A merry song , come : it grows late ; we 'll to bed . Thou 'lt forget me when I am gone .
DOLL TEARSHEET : By my troth , thou 'lt set me a-weeping , an thou sayest so : prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return : well , harken at the end .
FALSTAFF : Some sack , Francis .
