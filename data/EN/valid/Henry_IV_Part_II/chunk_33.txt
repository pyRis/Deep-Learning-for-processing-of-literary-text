KING HENRY IV : Thy wish was father , Harry , to that thought : I stay too long by thee , I weary thee . Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours Before thy hour be ripe ? O foolish youth ! Thou seek 'st the greatness that will o 'erwhelm thee . Stay but a little ; for my cloud of dignity Is held from falling with so weak a wind That it will quickly drop : my day is dim . Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours Were thine without offence ; and at my death Thou hast seal 'd up my expectation : Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not , And thou wilt have me die assured of it . Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts , Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart , To stab at half an hour of my life . What ! canst thou not forbear me half an hour ? Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself , And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear That thou art crowned , not that I am dead . Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head : Only compound me with forgotten dust Give that which gave thee life unto the worms . Pluck down my officers , break my decrees ; For now a time is come to mock at form : Harry the Fifth is crown 'd : up , vanity ! Down , royal state ! all you sage counsellors , hence ! And to the English court assemble now , From every region , apes of idleness ! Now , neighbour confines , purge you of your scum : Have you a ruffian that will swear , drink , dance , Revel the night , rob , murder , and commit The oldest sins the newest kind of ways ? Be happy , he will trouble you no more ; England shall double gild his treble guilt , England shall give him office , honour , might ; For the fifth Harry from curb 'd licence plucks The muzzle of restraint , and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent . O my poor kingdom , sick with civil blows ! When that my care could not withhold thy riots , What wilt thou do when riot is thy care ? O , thou wilt be a wilderness again , Peopled with wolves , thy old inhabitants !
