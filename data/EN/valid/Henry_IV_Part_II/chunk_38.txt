FALSTAFF : ' Tis so .
SILENCE : Is 't so ? Why then , say an old man can do somewhat . Re-enter DAVY
DAVY : An 't please your worship , there 's one Pistol come from the court with news .
FALSTAFF : From the court ! let him come in . Enter PISTOL How now , Pistol !
PISTOL : Sir John , God save you !
FALSTAFF : What wind blew you hither , Pistol ?
PISTOL : Not the ill wind which blows no man to good . Sweet knight , thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm .
SILENCE : By 'r lady , I think a ' be , but goodman Puff of Barson .
PISTOL : Puff ! Puff in thy teeth , most recreant coward base ! Sir John , I am thy Pistol and thy friend , And helter-skelter have I rode to thee , And tidings do I bring and lucky joys And golden times and happy news of price .
FALSTAFF : I pray thee now , deliver them like a man of this world .
PISTOL : A foutre for the world and worldlings base ! I speak of Africa and golden joys .
FALSTAFF : O base Assyrian knight , what is thy news ? Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof .
SILENCE : And Robin Hood , Scarlet , and John . Singing
PISTOL : Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons ? And shall good news be baffled ? Then , Pistol , lay thy head in Furies ' lap .
SILENCE : Honest gentleman , I know not your breeding .
PISTOL : Why then , lament therefore .
SHALLOW : Give me pardon , sir : if , sir , you come with news from the court , I take it there 's but two ways , either to utter them , or to conceal them . I am , sir , under the king , in some authority .
PISTOL : Under which king , Besonian ? speak , or die .
SHALLOW : Under King Harry .
PISTOL : Harry the Fourth ? or Fifth ?
SHALLOW : Harry the Fourth .
