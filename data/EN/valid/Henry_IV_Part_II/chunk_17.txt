FALSTAFF : Ha ! a bastard son of the king 's ? And art not thou Poins his brother ?
PRINCE HENRY : Why , thou globe of sinful continents ! what a life dost thou lead !
FALSTAFF : A better than thou : I am a gentleman ; thou art a drawer .
PRINCE HENRY : Very true , sir ; and I come to draw you out by the ears .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : O , the Lord preserve thy good grace ! by my troth , welcome to London . Now , the Lord bless that sweet face of thine ! O , Jesu , are you come from Wales ?
FALSTAFF : Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty , by this light flesh and corrupt blood , thou art welcome .
DOLL TEARSHEET : How , you fat fool ! I scorn you .
POINS : My lord , he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment , if you take not the heat .
PRINCE HENRY : You whoreson candle-mine , you , how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest , virtuous , civil gentlewoman !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : God 's blessing of your good heart ! and so she is , by my troth .
FALSTAFF : Didst thou hear me ?
PRINCE HENRY : Yea , and you knew me , as you did when you ran away by Gad 's-hill : you knew I was at your back , and spoke it on purpose to try my patience .
FALSTAFF : No , no , no ; not so ; I did not think thou wast within hearing .
PRINCE HENRY : I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse ; and then I know how to handle you .
FALSTAFF : No abuse , Hal , o ' mine honour , no abuse .
PRINCE HENRY : Not to dispraise me , and call me pantier and bread-chipper and I know not what ?
FALSTAFF : No abuse , Hal .
POINS : No abuse ?
FALSTAFF : No abuse , Ned , i ' the world ; honest Ned , none . I dispraised him before the wicked , that the wicked might not fall in love with him ; in which doing , I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject , and thy father is to give me thanks for it . No abuse , Hal : none , Ned , none : no , faith , boys , none .
PRINCE HENRY : See now , whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us ? is she of the wicked ? is thine hostess here of the wicked ? or is thy boy of the wicked ? or honest Bardolph , whose zeal burns in his nose , of the wicked ?
POINS : Answer , thou dead elm , answer .
FALSTAFF : The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable ; and his face is Lucifer 's privy-kitchen , where he doth nothing but roast malt-worms . For the boy , there is a good angel about him ; but the devil outbids him too .
PRINCE HENRY : For the women ?
FALSTAFF : For one of them , she is in hell already , and burns poor souls . For the other , I owe her money , and whether she be damned for that , I know not .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : No , I warrant you .
FALSTAFF : No , I think thou art not ; I think thou art quit for that . Marry , there is another indictment upon thee , for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house , contrary to the law ; for the which I think thou wilt howl .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : All victuallers do so ; what 's a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent ?
PRINCE HENRY : You , gentlewoman , -
DOLL TEARSHEET : What says your grace ?
FALSTAFF : His grace says that which his flesh rebels against . Knocking within
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Who knocks so loud at door ? Look to the door there , Francis . Enter PETO
PRINCE HENRY : Peto , how now ! what news ?
