Website:	Website:	Aging, conceited King Lear seeks to retire from his kingly duties. He plans to divide his kingdom among his three daughters. To decide how to split up the kingdom, he calls his daughters before the court and commands them each to proclaim how much they love him. The two oldest daughters, Goneril and Reagan, give extravagant speeches about their love for the King. His youngest and favorite daughter, Cordelia, refuses to flatter him and says nothing. In response, the King casts Cordelia out and hands over his power to Goneril and Reagan. Cordelia leaves to marry the king of France, while Lear begins his retirement. To Lear's astonishment, Goneril and Reagan disown the former king, leaving him homeless and destitute. He wanders the moors accompanied only by his Fool, descending into madness. At the same time, a nobleman named Gloucester has similar family trouble. Gloucester has one illegitimate son, Edmund, and one legitimate one, Edgar. Edmund makes a play for power by accusing Edgar of trying to kill Gloucester. Gloucester believes this lie and evicts Edgar, who goes in disguise as a madman to avoid detection. He eventually ends up in Lear's company, and the two wander the heaths together. Meanwhile, Cordelia returns with the French army, trying to overthrow her sisters and save her father. Gloucester attempts to help King Lear, and Goneril penalizes him for this treason by tearing out his eyes. The nobleman is left to wander the moors too. Goneril and Reagan's army captures Cordelia and Lear. For a brief time, they are united in prison, with a repentant Lear professing his love for his vindicated daughter. Edmund commands that Cordelia be executed for treason. As he dies from battle wounds, he changes his mind, but the order had already been carried out. Meanwhile, we learn that Edmund started affairs with both Reagan and Goneril. Jealous of her sister, Goneril poisons Reagan and then kills herself. King Lear dies of grief. The kingdom is left to Goneril's husband Albany, who restores Edgar's power and invites Edgar to rule with him.
