GOWER : Here a ' comes ; and the Scots captain , Captain Jamy , with him .
FLUELLEN : Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman , that is certain ; and of great expedition and knowledge in th ' aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions : by Cheshu , he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world , in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans .
JAMY : I say gud-day , Captain Fluellen .
FLUELLEN : God-den to your worship , good Captain James .
GOWER : How now , Captain Macmorris ! have you quit the mines ? have the pioneers given o 'er ?
MACMORRIS : By Chrish , la ! tish ill done : the work ish give over , the trompet sound the retreat . By my hand , I swear , and my father 's soul , the work ish ill done ; it ish give over : I would have blowed up the town , so Chrish save me , la ! in an hour : O , tish ill done , tish ill done ; by my hand , tish ill done !
FLUELLEN : Captain Macmorris , I beseech you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you , as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the Roman wars , in the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication ; partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline ; that is the point .
JAMY : It sall be vary gud , gud feith , gud captains bath : and I sall quit you with gud leve , as I may pick occasion ; that sall I , marry .
MACMORRIS : It is no time to discourse , so Chrish save me : the day is hot , and the weather , and the wars , and the king , and the dukes : it is no time to discourse . The town is beseeched , and the trumpet call us to the breach ; and we talk , and , be Chrish , do nothing : ' tis shame for us all : so God sa ' me , ' tis shame to stand still ; it is shame , by my hand : and there is throats to be cut , and works to be done ; and there ish nothing done , so Chrish sa ' me , la !
JAMY : By the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber , ay 'll de gud service , or ay 'll lig i ' the grund for it ; ay , or go to death ; and ay 'll pay ' t as valourously as I may , that sall I suerly do , that is the breff and the long . Marry , I wad full fain hear some question ' tween you tway .
FLUELLEN : Captain Macmorris , I think , look you , under your correction , there is not many of your nation--
MACMORRIS : Of my nation ! What ish my nation ? Ish a villain , and a bastard , and a knave , and a rascal . What ish my nation ? Who talks of my nation ?
FLUELLEN : Look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , Captain Macmorris , peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me , look you : being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war , and in the derivation of my birth , and in other particularities .
MACMORRIS : I do not know you so good a man as myself : so Chrish save me , I will cut off your head .
GOWER : Gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .
JAMY : A ! that 's a foul fault . A parley sounded
GOWER : The town sounds a parley .
