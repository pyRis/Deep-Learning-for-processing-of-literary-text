KATHARINE : Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France ?
KING HENRY V : No ; it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate : but , in loving me , you should love the friend of France ; for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it ; I will have it all mine : and , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then yours is France and you are mine .
KATHARINE : I cannot tell vat is dat .
KING HENRY V : No , Kate ? I will tell thee in French ; which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband 's neck , hardly to be shook off . Je quand sur le possession de France , et quand vous avez le possession de moi , --let me see , what then ? Saint Denis be my speed ! --donc votre est France et vous etes mienne . It is as easy for me , Kate , to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French : I shall never move thee in French , unless it be to laugh at me .
KATHARINE : Sauf votre honneur , le Francois que vous parlez , il est meilleur que l 'Anglois lequel je parle .
KING HENRY V : No , faith , is 't not , Kate : but thy speaking of my tongue , and I thine , most truly-falsely , must needs be granted to be much at one . But , Kate , dost thou understand thus much English , canst thou love me ?
KATHARINE : I cannot tell .
KING HENRY V : Can any of your neighbours tell , Kate ? I 'll ask them . Come , I know thou lovest me : and at night , when you come into your closet , you 'll question this gentlewoman about me ; and I know , Kate , you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart : but , good Kate , mock me mercifully ; the rather , gentle princess , because I love thee cruelly . If ever thou beest mine , Kate , as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt , I get thee with scambling , and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder : shall not thou and I , between Saint Denis and Saint George , compound a boy , half French , half English , that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard ? shall we not ? what sayest thou , my fair flower-de-luce ?
KATHARINE : I do not know dat
KING HENRY V : No ; ' tis hereafter to know , but now to promise : do but now promise , Kate , you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy ; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor . How answer you , la plus belle Katharine du monde , mon tres cher et devin deesse ?
KATHARINE : Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France .
