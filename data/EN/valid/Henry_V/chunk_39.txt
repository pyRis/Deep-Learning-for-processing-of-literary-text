FRENCH KING : Yes , my lord , you see them perspectively , the cities turned into a maid ; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered .
KING HENRY V : Shall Kate be my wife ?
FRENCH KING : So please you .
KING HENRY V : I am content ; so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her : so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
FRENCH KING : We have consented to all terms of reason .
KING HENRY V : Is 't so , my lords of England ?
WESTMORELAND : The king hath granted every article : His daughter first , and then in sequel all , According to their firm proposed natures .
EXETER : Only he hath not yet subscribed this : Where your majesty demands , that the King of France , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your highness in this form and with this addition in French , Notre trescher fils Henri , Roi d 'Angleterre , Heritier de France ; and thus in Latin , Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus , Rex Angliae , et Haeres Franciae .
FRENCH KING : Nor this I have not , brother , so denied , But your request shall make me let it pass .
KING HENRY V : I pray you then , in love and dear alliance , Let that one article rank with the rest ; And thereupon give me your daughter .
FRENCH KING : Take her , fair son , and from her blood raise up Issue to me ; that the contending kingdoms Of France and England , whose very shores look pale With envy of each other 's happiness , May cease their hatred , and this dear conjunction Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord In their sweet bosoms , that never war advance His bleeding sword ' twixt England and fair France .
ALL : Amen !
KING HENRY V : Now , welcome , Kate : and bear me witness all , That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen . Flourish
QUEEN ISABEL : God , the best maker of all marriages , Combine your hearts in one , your realms in one ! As man and wife , being two , are one in love , So be there ' twixt your kingdoms such a spousal , That never may ill office , or fell jealousy , Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage , Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms , To make divorce of their incorporate league ; That English may as French , French Englishmen , Receive each other . God speak this Amen !
ALL : Amen !
KING HENRY V : Prepare we for our marriage--on which day , My Lord of Burgundy , we 'll take your oath , And all the peers ' , for surety of our leagues . Then shall I swear to Kate , and you to me ; And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be ! EPILOGUE Enter Chorus
