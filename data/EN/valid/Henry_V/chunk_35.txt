KING HENRY V : Peace to this meeting , wherefore we are met ! Unto our brother France , and to our sister , Health and fair time of day ; joy and good wishes To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine ; And , as a branch and member of this royalty , By whom this great assembly is contrived , We do salute you , Duke of Burgundy ; And , princes French , and peers , health to you all !
KING OF FRANCE : Right joyous are we to behold your face , Most worthy brother England ; fairly met : So are you , princes English , every one .
QUEEN ISABEL : So happy be the issue , brother England , Of this good day and of this gracious meeting , As we are now glad to behold your eyes ; Your eyes , which hitherto have borne in them Against the French , that met them in their bent , The fatal balls of murdering basilisks : The venom of such looks , we fairly hope , Have lost their quality , and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .
KING HENRY V : To cry amen to that , thus we appear .
QUEEN ISABEL : You English princes all , I do salute you .
BURGUNDY : My duty to you both , on equal love , Great Kings of France and England ! That I have labour 'd , With all my wits , my pains and strong endeavours , To bring your most imperial majesties Unto this bar and royal interview , Your mightiness on both parts best can witness . Since then my office hath so far prevail 'd That , face to face and royal eye to eye , You have congreeted , let it not disgrace me , If I demand , before this royal view , What rub or what impediment there is , Why that the naked , poor and mangled Peace , Dear nurse of arts and joyful births , Should not in this best garden of the world Our fertile France , put up her lovely visage ? Alas , she hath from France too long been chased , And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps , Corrupting in its own fertility . Her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , Unpruned dies ; her hedges even-pleach 'd , Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , Put forth disorder 'd twigs ; her fallow leas The darnel , hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery ; The even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip , burnet and green clover , Wanting the scythe , all uncorrected , rank , Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burs , Losing both beauty and utility . And as our vineyards , fallows , meads and hedges , Defective in their natures , grow to wildness , Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost , or do not learn for want of time , The sciences that should become our country ; But grow like savages , --as soldiers will That nothing do but meditate on blood , -- To swearing and stern looks , diffused attire And every thing that seems unnatural . Which to reduce into our former favour You are assembled : and my speech entreats That I may know the let , why gentle Peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualities .
KING HENRY V : If , Duke of Burgundy , you would the peace , Whose want gives growth to the imperfections Which you have cited , you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands ; Whose tenors and particular effects You have enscheduled briefly in your hands .
BURGUNDY : The king hath heard them ; to the which as yet There is no answer made .
KING HENRY V : Well then the peace , Which you before so urged , lies in his answer .
KING OF FRANCE : I have but with a cursorary eye O 'erglanced the articles : pleaseth your grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more , with better heed To re-survey them , we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer .
