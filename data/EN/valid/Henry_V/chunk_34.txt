PISTOL : Ha ! art thou bedlam ? dost thou thirst , base Trojan , To have me fold up Parca 's fatal web ? Hence ! I am qualmish at the smell of leek .
FLUELLEN : I peseech you heartily , scurvy , lousy knave , at my desires , and my requests , and my petitions , to eat , look you , this leek : because , look you , you do not love it , nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions doo 's not agree with it , I would desire you to eat it .
PISTOL : Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
FLUELLEN : There is one goat for you . Strikes him Will you be so good , scauld knave , as eat it ?
PISTOL : Base Trojan , thou shalt die .
FLUELLEN : You say very true , scauld knave , when God 's will is : I will desire you to live in the mean time , and eat your victuals : come , there is sauce for it . Strikes him You called me yesterday mountain-squire ; but I will make you to-day a squire of low degree . I pray you , fall to : if you can mock a leek , you can eat a leek .
GOWER : Enough , captain : you have astonished him .
FLUELLEN : I say , I will make him eat some part of my leek , or I will peat his pate four days . Bite , I pray you ; it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .
PISTOL : Must I bite ?
FLUELLEN : Yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question too , and ambiguities .
PISTOL : By this leek , I will most horribly revenge : I eat and eat , I swear--
FLUELLEN : Eat , I pray you : will you have some more sauce to your leek ? there is not enough leek to swear by .
PISTOL : Quiet thy cudgel ; thou dost see I eat .
FLUELLEN : Much good do you , scauld knave , heartily . Nay , pray you , throw none away ; the skin is good for your broken coxcomb . When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter , I pray you , mock at ' em ; that is all .
PISTOL : Good .
FLUELLEN : Ay , leeks is good : hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .
PISTOL : Me a groat !
FLUELLEN : Yes , verily and in truth , you shall take it ; or I have another leek in my pocket , which you shall eat .
PISTOL : I take thy groat in earnest of revenge .
FLUELLEN : If I owe you any thing , I will pay you in cudgels : you shall be a woodmonger , and buy nothing of me but cudgels . God b ' wi ' you , and keep you , and heal your pate . Exit
PISTOL : All hell shall stir for this .
GOWER : Go , go ; you are a counterfeit cowardly knave . Will you mock at an ancient tradition , begun upon an honourable respect , and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words ? I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice . You thought , because he could not speak English in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an English cudgel : you find it otherwise ; and henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition . Fare ye well . Exit
