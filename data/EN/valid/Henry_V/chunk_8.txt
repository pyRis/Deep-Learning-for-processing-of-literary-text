EXETER : I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge . I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham . I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland .
SCROOP : Our purposes God justly hath discover 'd ; And I repent my fault more than my death ; Which I beseech your highness to forgive , Although my body pay the price of it .
CAMBRIDGE : For me , the gold of France did not seduce ; Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended : But God be thanked for prevention ; Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice , Beseeching God and you to pardon me .
GREY : Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o 'er myself . Prevented from a damned enterprise : My fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .
KING HENRY V : God quit you in his mercy ! Hear your sentence . You have conspired against our royal person , Join 'd with an enemy proclaim 'd and from his coffers Received the golden earnest of our death ; Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter , His princes and his peers to servitude , His subjects to oppression and contempt And his whole kingdom into desolation . Touching our person seek we no revenge ; But we our kingdom 's safety must so tender , Whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws We do deliver you . Get you therefore hence , Poor miserable wretches , to your death : The taste whereof , God of his mercy give You patience to endure , and true repentance Of all your dear offences ! Bear them hence . Now , lords , for France ; the enterprise whereof Shall be to you , as us , like glorious . We doubt not of a fair and lucky war , Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings . We doubt not now But every rub is smoothed on our way . Then forth , dear countrymen : let us deliver Our puissance into the hand of God , Putting it straight in expedition . Cheerly to sea ; the signs of war advance : No king of England , if not king of France . Enter PISTOL , Hostess , NYM , BARDOLPH , and Boy
Hostess : Prithee , honey-sweet husband , let me bring thee to Staines .
PISTOL : No ; for my manly heart doth yearn . Bardolph , be blithe : Nym , rouse thy vaunting veins : Boy , bristle thy courage up ; for Falstaff he is dead , And we must yearn therefore .
BARDOLPH : Would I were with him , wheresome 'er he is , either in heaven or in hell !
