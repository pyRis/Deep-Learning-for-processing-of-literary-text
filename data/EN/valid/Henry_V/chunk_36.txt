QUEEN ISABEL : Our gracious brother , I will go with them : Haply a woman 's voice may do some good , When articles too nicely urged be stood on .
KING HENRY V : Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us : She is our capital demand , comprised Within the fore-rank of our articles .
QUEEN ISABEL : She hath good leave .
KING HENRY V : Fair Katharine , and most fair , Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady 's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart ?
KATHARINE : Your majesty shall mock at me ; I cannot speak your England .
KING HENRY V : O fair Katharine , if you will love me soundly with your French heart , I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue . Do you like me , Kate ?
KATHARINE : Pardonnez-moi , I cannot tell vat is ' like me . '

KING HENRY V : I said so , dear Katharine ; and I must not blush to affirm it .
KATHARINE : O bon Dieu ! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies .
KING HENRY V : What says she , fair one ? that the tongues of men are full of deceits ?
ALICE : Oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits : dat is de princess .
KING HENRY V : The princess is the better Englishwoman . I ' faith , Kate , my wooing is fit for thy understanding : I am glad thou canst speak no better English ; for , if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown . I know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say ' I love you : ' then if you urge me farther than to say ' do you in faith ? ' I wear out my suit . Give me your answer ; i ' faith , do : and so clap hands and a bargain : how say you , lady ?
KATHARINE : Sauf votre honneur , me understand vell .
