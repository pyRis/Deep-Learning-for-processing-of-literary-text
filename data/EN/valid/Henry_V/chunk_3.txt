CANTERBURY : Therefore doth heaven divide The state of man in divers functions , Setting endeavour in continual motion ; To which is fixed , as an aim or butt , Obedience : for so work the honey-bees , Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom . They have a king and officers of sorts ; Where some , like magistrates , correct at home , Others , like merchants , venture trade abroad , Others , like soldiers , armed in their stings , Make boot upon the summer 's velvet buds , Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tent-royal of their emperor ; Who , busied in his majesty , surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold , The civil citizens kneading up the honey , The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate , The sad-eyed justice , with his surly hum , Delivering o 'er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone . I this infer , That many things , having full reference To one consent , may work contrariously : As many arrows , loosed several ways , Come to one mark ; as many ways meet in one town ; As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea ; As many lines close in the dial 's centre ; So may a thousand actions , once afoot . End in one purpose , and be all well borne Without defeat . Therefore to France , my liege . Divide your happy England into four ; Whereof take you one quarter into France , And you withal shall make all Gallia shake . If we , with thrice such powers left at home , Cannot defend our own doors from the dog , Let us be worried and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy .
KING HENRY V : Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin . Now are we well resolved ; and , by God 's help , And yours , the noble sinews of our power , France being ours , we 'll bend it to our awe , Or break it all to pieces : or there we 'll sit , Ruling in large and ample empery O 'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms , Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn , Tombless , with no remembrance over them : Either our history shall with full mouth Speak freely of our acts , or else our grave , Like Turkish mute , shall have a tongueless mouth , Not worshipp 'd with a waxen epitaph . Enter Ambassadors of France Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin ; for we hear Your greeting is from him , not from the king .
First Ambassador : May 't please your majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge ; Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin 's meaning and our embassy ?
KING HENRY V : We are no tyrant , but a Christian king ; Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As are our wretches fetter 'd in our prisons : Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin 's mind .
First Ambassador : Thus , then , in few . Your highness , lately sending into France , Did claim some certain dukedoms , in the right Of your great predecessor , King Edward the Third . In answer of which claim , the prince our master Says that you savour too much of your youth , And bids you be advised there 's nought in France That can be with a nimble galliard won ; You cannot revel into dukedoms there . He therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , This tun of treasure ; and , in lieu of this , Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you . This the Dauphin speaks .
KING HENRY V : What treasure , uncle ?
EXETER : Tennis-balls , my liege .
