EXETER : This was a merry message .
KING HENRY V : We hope to make the sender blush at it . Therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour That may give furtherance to our expedition ; For we have now no thought in us but France , Save those to God , that run before our business . Therefore let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness add More feathers to our wings ; for , God before , We 'll chide this Dauphin at his father 's door . Therefore let every man now task his thought , That this fair action may on foot be brought . Enter Chorus
Chorus : Now all the youth of England are on fire , And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies : Now thrive the armourers , and honour 's thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man : They sell the pasture now to buy the horse , Following the mirror of all Christian kings , With winged heels , as English Mercuries . For now sits Expectation in the air , And hides a sword from hilts unto the point With crowns imperial , crowns and coronets , Promised to Harry and his followers . The French , advised by good intelligence Of this most dreadful preparation , Shake in their fear and with pale policy Seek to divert the English purposes . O England ! model to thy inward greatness , Like little body with a mighty heart , What mightst thou do , that honour would thee do , Were all thy children kind and natural ! But see thy fault ! France hath in thee found out A nest of hollow bosoms , which he fills With treacherous crowns ; and three corrupted men , One , Richard Earl of Cambridge , and the second , Henry Lord Scroop of Masham , and the third , Sir Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland , Have , for the gilt of France , --O guilt indeed ! Confirm 'd conspiracy with fearful France ; And by their hands this grace of kings must die , If hell and treason hold their promises , Ere he take ship for France , and in Southampton . Linger your patience on ; and we 'll digest The abuse of distance ; force a play : The sum is paid ; the traitors are agreed ; The king is set from London ; and the scene Is now transported , gentles , to Southampton ; There is the playhouse now , there must you sit : And thence to France shall we convey you safe , And bring you back , charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass ; for , if we may , We 'll not offend one stomach with our play . But , till the king come forth , and not till then , Unto Southampton do we shift our scene . Exit Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH
BARDOLPH : Well met , Corporal Nym .
NYM : Good morrow , Lieutenant Bardolph .
BARDOLPH : What , are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet ?
NYM : For my part , I care not : I say little ; but when time shall serve , there shall be smiles ; but that shall be as it may . I dare not fight ; but I will wink and hold out mine iron : it is a simple one ; but what though ? it will toast cheese , and it will endure cold as another man 's sword will : and there 's an end .
BARDOLPH : I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends ; and we 'll be all three sworn brothers to France : let it be so , good Corporal Nym .
NYM : Faith , I will live so long as I may , that 's the certain of it ; and when I cannot live any longer , I will do as I may : that is my rest , that is the rendezvous of it .
BARDOLPH : It is certain , corporal , that he is married to Nell Quickly : and certainly she did you wrong ; for you were troth-plight to her .
