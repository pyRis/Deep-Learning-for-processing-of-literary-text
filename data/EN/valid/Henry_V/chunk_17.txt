GOWER : Why , ' tis a gull , a fool , a rogue , that now and then goes to the wars , to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier . And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders ' names : and they will learn you by rote where services were done ; at such and such a sconce , at such a breach , at such a convoy ; who came off bravely , who was shot , who disgraced , what terms the enemy stood on ; and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war , which they trick up with new-tuned oaths : and what a beard of the general 's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits , is wonderful to be thought on . But you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvellously mistook .
FLUELLEN : I tell you what , Captain Gower ; I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is : if I find a hole in his coat , I will tell him my mind . Drum heard Hark you , the king is coming , and I must speak with him from the pridge . Drum and colours . Enter KING HENRY , GLOUCESTER , and Soldiers God pless your majesty !
KING HENRY V : How now , Fluellen ! camest thou from the bridge ?
FLUELLEN : Ay , so please your majesty . The Duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge : the French is gone off , look you ; and there is gallant and most prave passages ; marry , th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge ; but he is enforced to retire , and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge : I can tell your majesty , the duke is a prave man .
KING HENRY V : What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
FLUELLEN : The perdition of th ' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great : marry , for my part , I think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , if your majesty know the man : his face is all bubukles , and whelks , and knobs , and flames o ' fire : and his lips blows at his nose , and it is like a coal of fire , sometimes plue and sometimes red ; but his nose is executed and his fire 's out .
KING HENRY V : We would have all such offenders so cut off : and we give express charge , that in our marches through the country , there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language ; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner . Tucket . Enter MONTJOY
MONTJOY : You know me by my habit .
KING HENRY V : Well then I know thee : what shall I know of thee ?
MONTJOY : My master 's mind .
KING HENRY V : Unfold it .
