KATHARINE : Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere .
KING HENRY V : Nay , it will please him well , Kate it shall please him , Kate .
KATHARINE : Den it sall also content me .
KING HENRY V : Upon that I kiss your hand , and I call you my queen .
KATHARINE : Laissez , mon seigneur , laissez , laissez : ma foi , je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d 'une de votre seigeurie indigne serviteur ; excusez-moi , je vous supplie , mon tres-puissant seigneur .
KING HENRY V : Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
KATHARINE : Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur noces , il n 'est pas la coutume de France .
KING HENRY V : Madam my interpreter , what says she ?
ALICE : Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France , --I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish .
KING HENRY V : To kiss .
ALICE : Your majesty entendre bettre que moi .
KING HENRY V : It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , would she say ?
ALICE : Oui , vraiment .
KING HENRY V : O Kate , nice customs curtsy to great kings . Dear Kate , you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country 's fashion : we are the makers of manners , Kate ; and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults ; as I will do yours , for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss : therefore , patiently and yielding . Kissing her You have witchcraft in your lips , Kate : there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council ; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs . Here comes your father . Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN , BURGUNDY , and other Lords
BURGUNDY : God save your majesty ! my royal cousin , teach you our princess English ?
KING HENRY V : I would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly I love her ; and that is good English .
BURGUNDY : Is she not apt ?
KING HENRY V : Our tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth ; so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her , that he will appear in his true likeness .
BURGUNDY : Pardon the frankness of my mirth , if I answer you for that . If you would conjure in her , you must make a circle ; if conjure up love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind . Can you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self ? It were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
KING HENRY V : Yet they do wink and yield , as love is blind and enforces .
BURGUNDY : They are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
KING HENRY V : Then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
BURGUNDY : I will wink on her to consent , my lord , if you will teach her to know my meaning : for maids , well summered and warm kept , are like flies at Bartholomew-tide , blind , though they have their eyes ; and then they will endure handling , which before would not abide looking on .
KING HENRY V : This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer ; and so I shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
BURGUNDY : As love is , my lord , before it loves .
