FLUELLEN : If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb ? in your own conscience , now ?
GOWER : I will speak lower .
FLUELLEN : I pray you and beseech you that you will .
KING HENRY V : Though it appear a little out of fashion , There is much care and valour in this Welshman . Enter three soldiers , JOHN BATES , ALEXANDER COURT , and MICHAEL WILLIAMS
COURT : Brother John Bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?
BATES : I think it be : but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day .
WILLIAMS : We see yonder the beginning of the day , but I think we shall never see the end of it . Who goes there ?
KING HENRY V : A friend .
WILLIAMS : Under what captain serve you ?
KING HENRY V : Under Sir Thomas Erpingham .
WILLIAMS : A good old commander and a most kind gentleman : I pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
KING HENRY V : Even as men wrecked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .
BATES : He hath not told his thought to the king ?
KING HENRY V : No ; nor it is not meet he should . For , though I speak it to you , I think the king is but a man , as I am : the violet smells to him as it doth to me : the element shows to him as it doth to me ; all his senses have but human conditions : his ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man ; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet , when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing . Therefore when he sees reason of fears , as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are : yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .
BATES : He may show what outward courage he will ; but I believe , as cold a night as ' tis , he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck ; and so I would he were , and I by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here .
KING HENRY V : By my troth , I will speak my conscience of the king : I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is .
BATES : Then I would he were here alone ; so should he be sure to be ransomed , and a many poor men 's lives saved .
KING HENRY V : I dare say you love him not so ill , to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men 's minds : methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king 's company ; his cause being just and his quarrel honourable .
WILLIAMS : That 's more than we know .
BATES : Ay , or more than we should seek after ; for we know enough , if we know we are the kings subjects : if his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us .
