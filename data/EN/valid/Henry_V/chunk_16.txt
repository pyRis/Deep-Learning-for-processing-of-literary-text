Constable : This becomes the great . Sorry am I his numbers are so few , His soldiers sick and famish 'd in their march , For I am sure , when he shall see our army , He 'll drop his heart into the sink of fear And for achievement offer us his ransom .
KING OF FRANCE : Therefore , lord constable , haste on Montjoy . And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give . Prince Dauphin , you shall stay with us in Rouen .
DAUPHIN : Not so , I do beseech your majesty .
KING OF FRANCE : Be patient , for you shall remain with us . Now forth , lord constable and princes all , And quickly bring us word of England 's fall . Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN , meeting
GOWER : How now , Captain Fluellen ! come you from the bridge ?
FLUELLEN : I assure you , there is very excellent services committed at the bridge .
GOWER : Is the Duke of Exeter safe ?
FLUELLEN : The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon ; and a man that I love and honour with my soul , and my heart , and my duty , and my life , and my living , and my uttermost power : he is not-God be praised and blessed ! --any hurt in the world ; but keeps the bridge most valiantly , with excellent discipline . There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge , I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony ; and he is a man of no estimation in the world ; but did see him do as gallant service .
GOWER : What do you call him ?
FLUELLEN : He is called Aunchient Pistol .
GOWER : I know him not . Enter PISTOL
FLUELLEN : Here is the man .
PISTOL : Captain , I thee beseech to do me favours : The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well .
FLUELLEN : Ay , I praise God ; and I have merited some love at his hands .
PISTOL : Bardolph , a soldier , firm and sound of heart , And of buxom valour , hath , by cruel fate , And giddy Fortune 's furious fickle wheel , That goddess blind , That stands upon the rolling restless stone--
FLUELLEN : By your patience , Aunchient Pistol . Fortune is painted blind , with a muffler afore her eyes , to signify to you that Fortune is blind ; and she is painted also with a wheel , to signify to you , which is the moral of it , that she is turning , and inconstant , and mutability , and variation : and her foot , look you , is fixed upon a spherical stone , which rolls , and rolls , and rolls : in good truth , the poet makes a most excellent description of it : Fortune is an excellent moral .
PISTOL : Fortune is Bardolph 's foe , and frowns on him ; For he hath stolen a pax , and hanged must a ' be : A damned death ! Let gallows gape for dog ; let man go free And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate : But Exeter hath given the doom of death For pax of little price . Therefore , go speak : the duke will hear thy voice : And let not Bardolph 's vital thread be cut With edge of penny cord and vile reproach : Speak , captain , for his life , and I will thee requite .
FLUELLEN : Aunchient Pistol , I do partly understand your meaning .
PISTOL : Why then , rejoice therefore .
FLUELLEN : Certainly , aunchient , it is not a thing to rejoice at : for if , look you , he were my brother , I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure , and put him to execution ; for discipline ought to be used .
PISTOL : Die and be damn 'd ! and figo for thy friendship !
FLUELLEN : It is well .
PISTOL : The fig of Spain ! Exit
FLUELLEN : Very good .
GOWER : Why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal ; I remember him now ; a bawd , a cutpurse .
