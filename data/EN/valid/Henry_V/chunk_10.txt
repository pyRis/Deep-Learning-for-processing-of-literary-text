KING OF FRANCE : Think we King Harry strong ; And , princes , look you strongly arm to meet him . The kindred of him hath been flesh 'd upon us ; And he is bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths : Witness our too much memorable shame When Cressy battle fatally was struck , And all our princes captiv 'd by the hand Of that black name , Edward , Black Prince of Wales ; Whiles that his mountain sire , on mountain standing , Up in the air , crown 'd with the golden sun , Saw his heroical seed , and smiled to see him , Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made . This is a stem Of that victorious stock ; and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of him . Enter a Messenger
Messenger : Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your majesty .
KING OF FRANCE : We 'll give them present audience . Go , and bring them . You see this chase is hotly follow 'd , friends .
DAUPHIN : Turn head , and stop pursuit ; for coward dogs Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten Runs far before them . Good my sovereign , Take up the English short , and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head : Self-love , my liege , is not so vile a sin As self-neglecting . Re-enter Lords , with EXETER and train
KING OF FRANCE : From our brother England ?
EXETER : From him ; and thus he greets your majesty . He wills you , in the name of God Almighty , That you divest yourself , and lay apart The borrow 'd glories that by gift of heaven , By law of nature and of nations , ' long To him and to his heirs ; namely , the crown And all wide-stretched honours that pertain By custom and the ordinance of times Unto the crown of France . That you may know ' Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim , Pick 'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish 'd days , Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked , He sends you this most memorable line , In every branch truly demonstrative ; Willing to overlook this pedigree : And when you find him evenly derived From his most famed of famous ancestors , Edward the Third , he bids you then resign Your crown and kingdom , indirectly held From him the native and true challenger .
KING OF FRANCE : Or else what follows ?
EXETER : Bloody constraint ; for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts , there will he rake for it : Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming , In thunder and in earthquake , like a Jove , That , if requiring fail , he will compel ; And bids you , in the bowels of the Lord , Deliver up the crown , and to take mercy On the poor souls for whom this hungry war Opens his vasty jaws ; and on your head Turning the widows ' tears , the orphans ' cries The dead men 's blood , the pining maidens groans , For husbands , fathers and betrothed lovers , That shall be swallow 'd in this controversy . This is his claim , his threatening and my message ; Unless the Dauphin be in presence here , To whom expressly I bring greeting too .
KING OF FRANCE : For us , we will consider of this further : To-morrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England .
DAUPHIN : For the Dauphin , I stand here for him : what to him from England ?
EXETER : Scorn and defiance ; slight regard , contempt , And any thing that may not misbecome The mighty sender , doth he prize you at . Thus says my king ; an ' if your father 's highness Do not , in grant of all demands at large , Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty , He 'll call you to so hot an answer of it , That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordnance .
