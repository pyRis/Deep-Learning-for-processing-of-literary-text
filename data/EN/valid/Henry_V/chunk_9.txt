NYM : They say he cried out of sack .
Hostess : Ay , that a ' did .
BARDOLPH : And of women .
Hostess : Nay , that a ' did not .
Boy : Yes , that a ' did ; and said they were devils incarnate .
Hostess : A ' could never abide carnation ; ' twas a colour he never liked .
Boy : A ' said once , the devil would have him about women .
Hostess : A ' did in some sort , indeed , handle women ; but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the whore of Babylon .
Boy : Do you not remember , a ' saw a flea stick upon Bardolph 's nose , and a ' said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire ?
BARDOLPH : Well , the fuel is gone that maintained that fire : that 's all the riches I got in his service .
NYM : Shall we shog ? the king will be gone from Southampton .
PISTOL : Come , let 's away . My love , give me thy lips . Look to my chattels and my movables : Let senses rule ; the word is ' Pitch and Pay : ' Trust none ; For oaths are straws , men 's faiths are wafer-cakes , And hold-fast is the only dog , my duck : Therefore , Caveto be thy counsellor . Go , clear thy c rystals . Yoke-fellows in arms , Let us to France ; like horse-leeches , my boys , To suck , to suck , the very blood to suck !
Boy : And that 's but unwholesome food they say .
PISTOL : Touch her soft mouth , and march .
BARDOLPH : Farewell , hostess . Kissing her
NYM : I cannot kiss , that is the humour of it ; but , adieu .
PISTOL : Let housewifery appear : keep close , I thee command .
Hostess : Farewell ; adieu . Flourish . Enter the FRENCH KING , the DAUPHIN , the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE , the Constable , and others
KING OF FRANCE : Thus comes the English with full power upon us ; And more than carefully it us concerns To answer royally in our defences . Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne , Of Brabant and of Orleans , shall make forth , And you , Prince Dauphin , with all swift dispatch , To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant ; For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf . It fits us then to be as provident As fear may teach us out of late examples Left by the fatal and neglected English Upon our fields .
DAUPHIN : My most redoubted father , It is most meet we arm us ' gainst the foe ; For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom , Though war nor no known quarrel were in question , But that defences , musters , preparations , Should be maintain 'd , assembled and collected , As were a war in expectation . Therefore , I say ' tis meet we all go forth To view the sick and feeble parts of France : And let us do it with no show of fear ; No , with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance : For , my good liege , she is so idly king 'd , Her sceptre so fantastically borne By a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , That fear attends her not .
Constable : O peace , Prince Dauphin ! You are too much mistaken in this king : Question your grace the late ambassadors , With what great state he heard their embassy , How well supplied with noble counsellors , How modest in exception , and withal How terrible in constant resolution , And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus , Covering discretion with a coat of folly ; As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate .
