KING HENRY V : So , if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea , the imputation of his wickedness by your rule , should be imposed upon his father that sent him : or if a servant , under his master 's command transporting a sum of money , be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities , you may call the business of the master the author of the servant 's damnation : but this is not so : the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant ; for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services . Besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrement of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers : some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder ; some , of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury ; some , making the wars their bulwark , that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery . Now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from God : war is his beadle , war is vengeance ; so that here men are punished for before-breach of the king 's laws in now the king 's quarrel : where they feared the death , they have borne life away ; and where they would be safe , they perish : then if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited . Every subject 's duty is the king 's ; but every subject 's soul is his own . Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed , wash every mote out of his conscience : and dying so , death is to him advantage ; or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained : and in him that escapes , it were not sin to think that , making God so free an offer , He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare .
WILLIAMS : ' Tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head , the king is not to answer it .
BATES : But I do not desire he should answer for me ; and yet I determine to fight lustily for him .
KING HENRY V : I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
WILLIAMS : Ay , he said so , to make us fight cheerfully : but when our throats are cut , he may be ransomed , and we ne 'er the wiser .
KING HENRY V : If I live to see it , I will never trust his word after .
WILLIAMS : You pay him then . That 's a perilous shot out of an elder-gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch ! you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock 's feather . You 'll never trust his word after ! come , ' tis a foolish saying .
KING HENRY V : Your reproof is something too round : I should be angry with you , if the time were convenient .
WILLIAMS : Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
KING HENRY V : I embrace it .
WILLIAMS : How shall I know thee again ?
KING HENRY V : Give me any gage of thine , and I will wear it in my bonnet : then , if ever thou darest acknowledge it , I will make it my quarrel .
WILLIAMS : Here 's my glove : give me another of thine .
KING HENRY V : There .
