EXETER : In which array , brave soldier , doth he lie , Larding the plain ; and by his bloody side , Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds , The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies . Suffolk first died : and York , all haggled over , Comes to him , where in gore he lay insteep 'd , And takes him by the beard ; kisses the gashes That bloodily did spawn upon his face ; And cries aloud ' Tarry , dear cousin Suffolk ! My soul shall thine keep company to heaven ; Tarry , sweet soul , for mine , then fly abreast , As in this glorious and well-foughten field We kept together in our chivalry ! ' Upon these words I came and cheer 'd him up : He smiled me in the face , raught me his hand , And , with a feeble gripe , says ' Dear my lord , Commend my service to me sovereign . ' So did he turn and over Suffolk 's neck He threw his wounded arm and kiss 'd his lips ; And so espoused to death , with blood he seal 'd A testament of noble-ending love . The pretty and sweet manner of it forced Those waters from me which I would have stopp 'd ; But I had not so much of man in me , And all my mother came into mine eyes And gave me up to tears .
KING HENRY V : I blame you not ; For , hearing this , I must perforce compound With mistful eyes , or they will issue too . Alarum But , hark ! what new alarum is this same ? The French have reinforced their scatter 'd men : Then every soldier kill his prisoners : Give the word through . Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER
FLUELLEN : Kill the poys and the luggage ! ' tis expressly against the law of arms : ' tis as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offer 't ; in your conscience , now , is it not ?
GOWER : ' Tis certain there 's not a boy left alive ; and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha ' done this slaughter : besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king 's tent ; wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner 's throat . O , ' tis a gallant king !
FLUELLEN : Ay , he was porn at Monmouth , Captain Gower . What call you the town 's name where Alexander the Pig was born !
GOWER : Alexander the Great .
FLUELLEN : Why , I pray you , is not pig great ? the pig , or the great , or the mighty , or the huge , or the magnanimous , are all one reckonings , save the phrase is a little variations .
GOWER : I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon ; his father was called Philip of Macedon , as I take it .
FLUELLEN : I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn . I tell you , captain , if you look in the maps of the ' orld , I warrant you sall find , in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike . There is a river in Macedon ; and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth : it is called Wye at Monmouth ; but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river ; but ' tis all one , ' tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both . If you mark Alexander 's life well , Harry of Monmouth 's life is come after it indifferent well ; for there is figures in all things . Alexander , God knows , and you know , in his rages , and his furies , and his wraths , and his cholers , and his moods , and his displeasures , and his indignations , and also being a little intoxicates in his prains , did , in his ales and his angers , look you , kill his best friend , Cleitus .
GOWER : Our king is not like him in that : he never killed any of his friends .
