CAMBRIDGE : So may your highness , and yet punish too .
GREY : Sir , You show great mercy , if you give him life , After the taste of much correction .
KING HENRY V : Alas , your too much love and care of me Are heavy orisons ' gainst this poor wretch ! If little faults , proceeding on distemper , Shall not be wink 'd at , how shall we stretch our eye When capital crimes , chew 'd , swallow 'd and digested , Appear before us ? We 'll yet enlarge that man , Though Cambridge , Scroop and Grey , in their dear care And tender preservation of our person , Would have him punished . And now to our French causes : Who are the late commissioners ?
CAMBRIDGE : I one , my lord : Your highness bade me ask for it to-day .
SCROOP : So did you me , my liege .
GREY : And I , my royal sovereign .
KING HENRY V : Then , Richard Earl of Cambridge , there is yours ; There yours , Lord Scroop of Masham ; and , sir knight , Grey of Northumberland , this same is yours : Read them ; and know , I know your worthiness . My Lord of Westmoreland , and uncle Exeter , We will aboard to night . Why , how now , gentlemen ! What see you in those papers that you lose So much complexion ? Look ye , how they change ! Their cheeks are paper . Why , what read you there That hath so cowarded and chased your blood Out of appearance ?
CAMBRIDGE : I do confess my fault ; And do submit me to your highness ' mercy .
GREY SCROOP : To which we all appeal .
