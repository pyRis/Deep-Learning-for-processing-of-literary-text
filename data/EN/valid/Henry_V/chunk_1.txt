ELY : The strawberry grows underneath the nettle And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best Neighbour 'd by fruit of baser quality : And so the prince obscured his contemplation Under the veil of wildness ; which , no doubt , Grew like the summer grass , fastest by night , Unseen , yet crescive in his faculty .
CANTERBURY : It must be so ; for miracles are ceased ; And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected .
ELY : But , my good lord , How now for mitigation of this bill Urged by the commons ? Doth his majesty Incline to it , or no ?
CANTERBURY : He seems indifferent , Or rather swaying more upon our part Than cherishing the exhibiters against us ; For I have made an offer to his majesty , Upon our spiritual convocation And in regard of causes now in hand , Which I have open 'd to his grace at large , As touching France , to give a greater sum Than ever at one time the clergy yet Did to his predecessors part withal .
ELY : How did this offer seem received , my lord ?
CANTERBURY : With good acceptance of his majesty ; Save that there was not time enough to hear , As I perceived his grace would fain have done , The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms And generally to the crown and seat of France Derived from Edward , his great-grandfather .
ELY : What was the impediment that broke this off ?
CANTERBURY : The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience ; and the hour , I think , is come To give him hearing : is it four o 'clock ?
ELY : It is .
CANTERBURY : Then go we in , to know his embassy ; Which I could with a ready guess declare , Before the Frenchman speak a word of it .
ELY : I 'll wait upon you , and I long to hear it . Enter KING HENRY V , GLOUCESTER , BEDFORD , EXETER , WARWICK , WESTMORELAND , and Attendants
KING HENRY V : Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury ?
EXETER : Not here in presence .
KING HENRY V : Send for him , good uncle .
WESTMORELAND : Shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
KING HENRY V : Not yet , my cousin : we would be resolved , Before we hear him , of some things of weight That task our thoughts , concerning us and France . Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY , and the BISHOP of ELY
CANTERBURY : God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it !
KING HENRY V : Sure , we thank you . My learned lord , we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salique that they have in France Or should , or should not , bar us in our claim : And God forbid , my dear and faithful lord , That you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading , Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate , whose right Suits not in native colours with the truth ; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation Of what your reverence shall incite us to . Therefore take heed how you impawn our person , How you awake our sleeping sword of war : We charge you , in the name of God , take heed ; For never two such kingdoms did contend Without much fall of blood ; whose guiltless drops Are every one a woe , a sore complaint ' Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords That make such waste in brief mortality . Under this conjuration , speak , my lord ; For we will hear , note and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience wash 'd As pure as sin with baptism .
