KING HENRY V : If ever I live to see it , I will challenge it .
WILLIAMS : Thou darest as well be hanged .
KING HENRY V : Well . I will do it , though I take thee in the king 's company .
WILLIAMS : Keep thy word : fare thee well .
BATES : Be friends , you English fools , be friends : we have French quarrels enow , if you could tell how to reckon .
KING HENRY V : Indeed , the French may lay twenty French crowns to one , they will beat us ; for they bear them on their shoulders : but it is no English treason to cut French crowns , and to-morrow the king himself will be a clipper . Upon the king ! let us our lives , our souls , Our debts , our careful wives , Our children and our sins lay on the king ! We must bear all . O hard condition , Twin-born with greatness , subject to the breath Of every fool , whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing ! What infinite heart 's-ease Must kings neglect , that private men enjoy ! And what have kings , that privates have not too , Save ceremony , save general ceremony ? And what art thou , thou idle ceremony ? What kind of god art thou , that suffer 'st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ? What are thy rents ? what are thy comings in ? O ceremony , show me but thy worth ! What is thy soul of adoration ? Art thou aught else but place , degree and form , Creating awe and fear in other men ? Wherein thou art less happy being fear 'd Than they in fearing . What drink 'st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , But poison 'd flattery ? O , be sick , great greatness , And bid thy ceremony give thee cure ! Think 'st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation ? Will it give place to flexure and low bending ? Canst thou , when thou command 'st the beggar 's knee , Command the health of it ? No , thou proud dream , That play 'st so subtly with a king 's repose ; I am a king that find thee , and I know ' Tis not the balm , the sceptre and the ball , The sword , the mace , the crown imperial , The intertissued robe of gold and pearl , The farced title running ' fore the king , The throne he sits on , nor the tide of pomp That beats upon the high shore of this world , No , not all these , thrice-gorgeous ceremony , Not all these , laid in bed majestical , Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave , Who with a body fill 'd and vacant mind Gets him to rest , cramm 'd with distressful bread ; Never sees horrid night , the child of hell , But , like a lackey , from the rise to set Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night Sleeps in Elysium ; next day after dawn , Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse , And follows so the ever-running year , With profitable labour , to his grave : And , but for ceremony , such a wretch , Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king . The slave , a member of the country 's peace , Enjoys it ; but in gross brain little wots What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace , Whose hours the peasant best advantages . Enter ERPINGHAM
ERPINGHAM : My lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , Seek through your camp to find you .
KING HENRY V : Good old knight , Collect them all together at my tent : I 'll be before thee .
ERPINGHAM : I shall do 't , my lord . Exit
