BARDOLPH : On , on , on , on , on ! to the breach , to the breach !
NYM : Pray thee , corporal , stay : the knocks are too hot ; and , for mine own part , I have not a case of lives : the humour of it is too hot , that is the very plain-song of it .
PISTOL : The plain-song is most just : for humours do abound : Knocks go and come ; God 's vassals drop and die ; And sword and shield , In bloody field , Doth win immortal fame .
Boy : Would I were in an alehouse in London ! I would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety .
PISTOL : And I : If wishes would prevail with me , My purpose should not fail with me , But thither would I hie .
Boy : As duly , but not as truly , As bird doth sing on bough . Enter FLUELLEN
FLUELLEN : Up to the breach , you dogs ! avaunt , you cullions ! Driving them forward
PISTOL : Be merciful , great duke , to men of mould . Abate thy rage , abate thy manly rage , Abate thy rage , great duke ! Good bawcock , bate thy rage ; use lenity , sweet chuck !
NYM : These be good humours ! your honour wins bad humours .
Boy : As young as I am , I have observed these three swashers . I am boy to them all three : but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me ; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man . For Bardolph , he is white-livered and red-faced ; by the means whereof a ' faces it out , but fights not . For Pistol , he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword ; by the means whereof a ' breaks words , and keeps whole weapons . For Nym , he hath heard that men of few words are the best men ; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers , lest a ' should be thought a coward : but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds ; for a ' never broke any man 's head but his own , and that was against a post when he was drunk . They will steal any thing , and call it purchase . Bardolph stole a lute-case , bore it twelve leagues , and sold it for three half pence . Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching , and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel : I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals . They would have me as familiar with men 's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers : which makes much against my manhood , if I should take from another 's pocket to put into mine ; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs . I must leave them , and seek some better service : their villany goes against my weak stomach , and therefore I must cast it up . Exit Re-enter FLUELLEN , GOWER following
GOWER : Captain Fluellen , you must come presently to the mines ; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you .
FLUELLEN : To the mines ! tell you the duke , it is not so good to come to the mines ; for , look you , the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war : the concavities of it is not sufficient ; for , look you , the athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines : by Cheshu , I think a ' will plough up all , if there is not better directions .
GOWER : The Duke of Gloucester , to whom the order of the siege is given , is altogether directed by an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman , i ' faith .
FLUELLEN : It is Captain Macmorris , is it not ?
GOWER : I think it be .
