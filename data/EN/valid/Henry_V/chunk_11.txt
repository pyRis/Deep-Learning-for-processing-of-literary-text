EXETER : He 'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it , Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe : And , be assured , you 'll find a difference , As we his subjects have in wonder found , Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now : now he weighs time Even to the utmost grain : that you shall read In your own losses , if he stay in France .
KING OF FRANCE : To-morrow shall you know our mind at full .
EXETER : Dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay ; For he is footed in this land already .
KING OF FRANCE : You shall be soon dispatch 's with fair conditions : A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence . Enter Chorus
Chorus : Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought . Suppose that you have seen The well-appointed king at Hampton pier Embark his royalty ; and his brave fleet With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning : Play with your fancies , and in them behold Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing ; Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give To sounds confused ; behold the threaden sails , Borne with the invisible and creeping wind , Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow 'd sea , Breasting the lofty surge : O , do but think You stand upon the ravage and behold A city on the inconstant billows dancing ; For so appears this fleet majestical , Holding due course to Harfleur . Follow , follow : Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy , And leave your England , as dead midnight still , Guarded with grandsires , babies and old women , Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance ; For who is he , whose chin is but enrich 'd With one appearing hair , that will not follow These cull 'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France ? Work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege ; Behold the ordnance on their carriages , With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur . Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back ; Tells Harry that the king doth offer him Katharine his daughter , and with her , to dowry , Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms . The offer likes not : and the nimble gunner With linstock now the devilish cannon touches , Alarum , and chambers go off And down goes all before them . Still be kind , And eke out our performance with your mind . Exit Alarum . Enter KING HENRY , EXETER , BEDFORD , GLOUCESTER , and Soldiers , with scaling-ladders
