KING HENRY V : Who hath sent thee now ?
MONTJOY : The Constable of France .
KING HENRY V : I pray thee , bear my former answer back : Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones . Good God ! why should they mock poor fellows thus ? The man that once did sell the lion 's skin While the beast lived , was killed with hunting him . A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves ; upon the which , I trust , Shall witness live in brass of this day 's work : And those that leave their valiant bones in France , Dying like men , though buried in your dunghills , They shall be famed ; for there the sun shall greet them , And draw their honours reeking up to heaven ; Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime , The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France . Mark then abounding valour in our English , That being dead , like to the bullet 's grazing , Break out into a second course of mischief , Killing in relapse of mortality . Let me speak proudly : tell the constable We are but warriors for the working-day ; Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch 'd With rainy marching in the painful field ; There 's not a piece of feather in our host-- Good argument , I hope , we will not fly-- And time hath worn us into slovenry : But , by the mass , our hearts are in the trim ; And my poor soldiers tell me , yet ere night They 'll be in fresher robes , or they will pluck The gay new coats o 'er the French soldiers ' heads And turn them out of service . If they do this , -- As , if God please , they shall , --my ransom then Will soon be levied . Herald , save thou thy labour ; Come thou no more for ransom , gentle herald : They shall have none , I swear , but these my joints ; Which if they have as I will leave ' em them , Shall yield them little , tell the constable .
MONTJOY : I shall , King Harry . And so fare thee well : Thou never shalt hear herald any more . Exit
KING HENRY V : I fear thou 'lt once more come again for ransom . Enter YORK
YORK : My lord , most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward .
KING HENRY V : Take it , brave York . Now , soldiers , march away : And how thou pleasest , God , dispose the day ! Alarum . Excursions . Enter PISTOL , French Soldier , and Boy
PISTOL : Yield , cur !
French Soldier : Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite .
PISTOL : Qualtitie calmie custure me ! Art thou a gentleman ? what is thy name ? discuss .
French Soldier : O Seigneur Dieu !
PISTOL : O , Signieur Dew should be a gentleman : Perpend my words , O Signieur Dew , and mark ; O Signieur Dew , thou diest on point of fox , Except , O signieur , thou do give to me Egregious ransom .
French Soldier : O , prenez misericorde ! ayez pitie de moi !
PISTOL : Moy shall not serve ; I will have forty moys ; Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat In drops of crimson blood .
French Soldier : Est-il impossible d 'echapper la force de ton bras ?
PISTOL : Brass , cur ! Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat , Offer 'st me brass ?
French Soldier : O pardonnez moi !
PISTOL : Say 'st thou me so ? is that a ton of moys ? Come hither , boy : ask me this slave in French What is his name .
Boy : Ecoutez : comment etes-vous appele ?
French Soldier : Monsieur le Fer .
Boy : He says his name is Master Fer .
PISTOL : Master Fer ! I 'll fer him , and firk him , and ferret him : discuss the same in French unto him .
Boy : I do not know the French for fer , and ferret , and firk .
PISTOL : Bid him prepare ; for I will cut his throat .
