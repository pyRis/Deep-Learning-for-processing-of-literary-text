KING HENRY V : Gloucester , ' tis true that we are in great danger ; The greater therefore should our courage be . Good morrow , brother Bedford . God Almighty ! There is some soul of goodness in things evil , Would men observingly distil it out . For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers , Which is both healthful and good husbandry : Besides , they are our outward consciences , And preachers to us all , admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end . Thus may we gather honey from the weed , And make a moral of the devil himself . Enter ERPINGHAM Good morrow , old Sir Thomas Erpingham : A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France .
ERPINGHAM : Not so , my liege : this lodging likes me better , Since I may say ' Now lie I like a king . ' 
KING HENRY V : ' Tis good for men to love their present pains Upon example ; so the spirit is eased : And when the mind is quicken 'd , out of doubt , The organs , though defunct and dead before , Break up their drowsy grave and newly move , With casted slough and fresh legerity . Lend me thy cloak , Sir Thomas . Brothers both , Commend me to the princes in our camp ; Do my good morrow to them , and anon Desire them an to my pavilion .
GLOUCESTER : We shall , my liege .
ERPINGHAM : Shall I attend your grace ?
KING HENRY V : No , my good knight ; Go with my brothers to my lords of England : I and my bosom must debate awhile , And then I would no other company .
ERPINGHAM : The Lord in heaven bless thee , noble Harry !
KING HENRY V : God-a-mercy , old heart ! thou speak 'st cheerfully . Enter PISTOL
PISTOL : Qui va la ?
KING HENRY V : A friend .
PISTOL : Discuss unto me ; art thou officer ? Or art thou base , common and popular ?

PISTOL : Trail 'st thou the puissant pike ?
KING HENRY V : Even so . What are you ?
PISTOL : As good a gentleman as the emperor .
KING HENRY V : Then you are a better than the king .
PISTOL : The king 's a bawcock , and a heart of gold , A lad of life , an imp of fame ; Of parents good , of fist most valiant . I kiss his dirty shoe , and from heart-string I love the lovely bully . What is thy name ?
KING HENRY V : Harry le Roy .
PISTOL : Le Roy ! a Cornish name : art thou of Cornish crew ?
KING HENRY V : No , I am a Welshman .
PISTOL : Know 'st thou Fluellen ?
KING HENRY V : Yes .
PISTOL : Tell him , I 'll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy 's day .
KING HENRY V : Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .
PISTOL : Art thou his friend ?
KING HENRY V : And his kinsman too .
PISTOL : The figo for thee , then !
KING HENRY V : I thank you : God be with you !
PISTOL : My name is Pistol call 'd . Exit
KING HENRY V : It sorts well with your fierceness . Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER
GOWER : Captain Fluellen !
FLUELLEN : So ! in the name of Jesu Christ , speak lower . It is the greatest admiration of the universal world , when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept : if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great , you shall find , I warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble pabble in Pompey 's camp ; I warrant you , you shall find the ceremonies of the wars , and the cares of it , and the forms of it , and the sobriety of it , and the modesty of it , to be otherwise .
