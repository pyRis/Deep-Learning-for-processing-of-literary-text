BEDFORD : Farewell , good Salisbury ; and good luck go with thee !
EXETER : Farewell , kind lord ; fight valiantly to-day : And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it , For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour . Exit SALISBURY
BEDFORD : He is full of valour as of kindness ; Princely in both . Enter the KING
WESTMORELAND : O that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work to-day !
KING HENRY V : What 's he that wishes so ? My cousin Westmoreland ? No , my fair cousin : If we are mark 'd to die , we are enow To do our country loss ; and if to live , The fewer men , the greater share of honour . God 's will ! I pray thee , wish not one man more . By Jove , I am not covetous for gold , Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost ; It yearns me not if men my garments wear ; Such outward things dwell not in my desires : But if it be a sin to covet honour , I am the most offending soul alive . No , faith , my coz , wish not a man from England : God 's peace ! I would not lose so great an honour As one man more , methinks , would share from me For the best hope I have . O , do not wish one more ! Rather proclaim it , Westmoreland , through my host , That he which hath no stomach to this fight , Let him depart ; his passport shall be made And crowns for convoy put into his purse : We would not die in that man 's company That fears his fellowship to die with us . This day is called the feast of Crispian : He that outlives this day , and comes safe home , Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named , And rouse him at the name of Crispian . He that shall live this day , and see old age , Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours , And say ' To-morrow is Saint Crispian : ' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars . And say ' These wounds I had on Crispin 's day . ' Old men forget : yet all shall be forgot , But he 'll remember with advantages What feats he did that day : then shall our names . Familiar in his mouth as household words Harry the king , Bedford and Exeter , Warwick and Talbot , Salisbury and Gloucester , Be in their flowing cups freshly remember 'd . This story shall the good man teach his son ; And Crispin Crispian shall ne 'er go by , From this day to the ending of the world , But we in it shall be remember 'd ; We few , we happy few , we band of brothers ; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother ; be he ne 'er so vile , This day shall gentle his condition : And gentlemen in England now a-bed Shall think themselves accursed they were not here , And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin 's day . Re-enter SALISBURY
SALISBURY : My sovereign lord , bestow yourself with speed : The French are bravely in their battles set , And will with all expedience charge on us .
KING HENRY V : All things are ready , if our minds be so .
WESTMORELAND : Perish the man whose mind is backward now !
KING HENRY V : Thou dost not wish more help from England , coz ?
WESTMORELAND : God 's will ! my liege , would you and I alone , Without more help , could fight this royal battle !
KING HENRY V : Why , now thou hast unwish 'd five thousand men ; Which likes me better than to wish us one . You know your places : God be with you all ! Tucket . Enter MONTJOY
