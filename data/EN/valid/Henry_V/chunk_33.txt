EXETER : ' Tis wonderful !
KING HENRY V : Come , go we in procession to the village . And be it death proclaimed through our host To boast of this or take the praise from God Which is his only .
FLUELLEN : Is it not lawful , an please your majesty , to tell how many is killed ?
KING HENRY V : Yes , captain ; but with this acknowledgement , That God fought for us .
FLUELLEN : Yes , my conscience , he did us great good .
KING HENRY V : Do we all holy rites ; Let there be sung ' Non nobis ' and ' Te Deum ; ' The dead with charity enclosed in clay : And then to Calais ; and to England then : Where ne 'er from France arrived more happy men . Enter Chorus
Chorus : Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story , That I may prompt them : and of such as have , I humbly pray them to admit the excuse Of time , of numbers and due course of things , Which cannot in their huge and proper life Be here presented . Now we bear the king Toward Calais : grant him there ; there seen , Heave him away upon your winged thoughts Athwart the sea . Behold , the English beach Pales in the flood with men , with wives and boys , Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth 'd sea , Which like a mighty whiffler ' fore the king Seems to prepare his way : so let him land , And solemnly see him set on to London . So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath ; Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city : he forbids it , Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride ; Giving full trophy , signal and ostent Quite from himself to God . But now behold , In the quick forge and working-house of thought , How London doth pour out her citizens ! The mayor and all his brethren in best sort , Like to the senators of the antique Rome , With the plebeians swarming at their heels , Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in : As , by a lower but loving likelihood , Were now the general of our gracious empress , As in good time he may , from Ireland coming , Bringing rebellion broached on his sword , How many would the peaceful city quit , To welcome him ! much more , and much more cause , Did they this Harry . Now in London place him ; As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the King of England 's stay at home ; The emperor 's coming in behalf of France , To order peace between them ; and omit All the occurrences , whatever chanced , Till Harry 's back-return again to France : There must we bring him ; and myself have play 'd The interim , by remembering you ' tis past . Then brook abridgment , and your eyes advance , After your thoughts , straight back again to France . Exit Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER
GOWER : Nay , that 's right ; but why wear you your leek today ? Saint Davy 's day is past .
FLUELLEN : There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things : I will tell you , asse my friend , Captain Gower : the rascally , scald , beggarly , lousy , pragging knave , Pistol , which you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than a fellow , look you now , of no merits , he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday , look you , and bid me eat my leek : it was in place where I could not breed no contention with him ; but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again , and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires .

GOWER : Why , here he comes , swelling like a turkey-cock .
