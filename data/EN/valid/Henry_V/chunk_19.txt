ORLEANS : I have heard a sonnet begin so to one 's mistress .
DAUPHIN : Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser , for my horse is my mistress .
ORLEANS : Your mistress bears well .
DAUPHIN : Me well ; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress .
Constable : Nay , for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back .
DAUPHIN : So perhaps did yours .
Constable : Mine was not bridled .
DAUPHIN : O then belike she was old and gentle ; and you rode , like a kern of Ireland , your French hose off , and in your straight strossers .
Constable : You have good judgment in horsemanship .
DAUPHIN : Be warned by me , then : they that ride so and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs . I had rather have my horse to my mistress .
Constable : I had as lief have my mistress a jade .
DAUPHIN : I tell thee , constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
Constable : I could make as true a boast as that , if I had a sow to my mistress .
DAUPHIN : ' Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement , et la truie lavee au bourbier ; ' thou makest use of any thing .
Constable : Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress , or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .
RAMBURES : My lord constable , the armour that I saw in your tent to-night , are those stars or suns upon it ?
Constable : Stars , my lord .
DAUPHIN : Some of them will fall to-morrow , I hope .
Constable : And yet my sky shall not want .
DAUPHIN : That may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and ' twere more honour some were away .
Constable : Even as your horse bears your praises ; who would trot as well , were some of your brags dismounted .
DAUPHIN : Would I were able to load him with his desert ! Will it never be day ? I will trot to-morrow a mile , and my way shall be paved with English faces .
Constable : I will not say so , for fear I should be faced out of my way : but I would it were morning ; for I would fain be about the ears of the English .
RAMBURES : Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners ?
Constable : You must first go yourself to hazard , ere you have them .
DAUPHIN : ' Tis midnight ; I 'll go arm myself . Exit
ORLEANS : The Dauphin longs for morning .
RAMBURES : He longs to eat the English .
Constable : I think he will eat all he kills .
ORLEANS : By the white hand of my lady , he 's a gallant prince .
Constable : Swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
ORLEANS : He is simply the most active gentleman of France .
Constable : Doing is activity ; and he will still be doing .
ORLEANS : He never did harm , that I heard of .
Constable : Nor will do none to-morrow : he will keep that good name still .
ORLEANS : I know him to be valiant .
Constable : I was told that by one that knows him better than you .
ORLEANS : What 's he ?
Constable : Marry , he told me so himself ; and he said he cared not who knew it
ORLEANS : He needs not ; it is no hidden virtue in him .
Constable : By my faith , sir , but it is ; never any body saw it but his lackey : ' tis a hooded valour ; and when it appears , it will bate .
ORLEANS : Ill will never said well .
Constable : I will cap that proverb with ' There is flattery in friendship . ' 
ORLEANS : And I will take up that with ' Give the devil his due . ' 
Constable : Well placed : there stands your friend for the devil : have at the very eye of that proverb with ' A pox of the devil . '
