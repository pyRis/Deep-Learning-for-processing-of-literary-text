Chorus : O for a Muse of fire , that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention , A kingdom for a stage , princes to act And monarchs to behold the swelling scene ! Then should the warlike Harry , like himself , Assume the port of Mars ; and at his heels , Leash 'd in like hounds , should famine , sword and fire Crouch for employment . But pardon , and gentles all , The flat unraised spirits that have dared On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object : can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of France ? or may we cram Within this wooden O the very casques That did affright the air at Agincourt ? O , pardon ! since a crooked figure may Attest in little place a million ; And let us , ciphers to this great accompt , On your imaginary forces work . Suppose within the girdle of these walls Are now confined two mighty monarchies , Whose high upreared and abutting fronts The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder : Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts ; Into a thousand parts divide on man , And make imaginary puissance ; Think when we talk of horses , that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i ' the receiving earth ; For ' tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings , Carry them here and there ; jumping o 'er times , Turning the accomplishment of many years Into an hour-glass : for the which supply , Admit me Chorus to this history ; Who prologue-like your humble patience pray , Gently to hear , kindly to judge , our play . Exit Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY , and the BISHOP OF ELY
CANTERBURY : My lord , I 'll tell you ; that self bill is urged , Which in the eleventh year of the last king 's reign Was like , and had indeed against us pass 'd , But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question .
ELY : But how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?
CANTERBURY : It must be thought on . If it pass against us , We lose the better half of our possession : For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the church Would they strip from us ; being valued thus : As much as would maintain , to the king 's honour , Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , Six thousand and two hundred good esquires ; And , to relief of lazars and weak age , Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil . A hundred almshouses right well supplied ; And to the coffers of the king beside , A thousand pounds by the year : thus runs the bill .
ELY : This would drink deep .
CANTERBURY : ' Twould drink the cup and all .
ELY : But what prevention ?
CANTERBURY : The king is full of grace and fair regard .
ELY : And a true lover of the holy church .
CANTERBURY : The courses of his youth promised it not . The breath no sooner left his father 's body , But that his wildness , mortified in him , Seem 'd to die too ; yea , at that very moment Consideration , like an angel , came And whipp 'd the offending Adam out of him , Leaving his body as a paradise , To envelop and contain celestial spirits . Never was such a sudden scholar made ; Never came reformation in a flood , With such a heady currance , scouring faults Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness So soon did lose his seat and all at once As in this king .
ELY : We are blessed in the change .
