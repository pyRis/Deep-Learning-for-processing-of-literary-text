BARDOLPH : Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife : good corporal , be patient here . How now , mine host Pistol !
PISTOL : Base tike , call 'st thou me host ? Now , by this hand , I swear , I scorn the term ; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers .
Hostess : No , by my troth , not long ; for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles , but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight . NYM and PISTOL draw O well a day , Lady , if he be not drawn now ! we shall see wilful adultery and murder committed .
BARDOLPH : Good lieutenant ! good corporal ! offer nothing here .
NYM : Pish !
PISTOL : Pish for thee , Iceland dog ! thou prick-ear 'd cur of Iceland !
Hostess : Good Corporal Nym , show thy valour , and put up your sword .
NYM : Will you shog off ? I would have you solus .
PISTOL : ' Solus , ' egregious dog ? O viper vile ! The ' solus ' in thy most mervailous face ; The ' solus ' in thy teeth , and in thy throat , And in thy hateful lungs , yea , in thy maw , perdy , And , which is worse , within thy nasty mouth ! I do retort the ' solus ' in thy bowels ; For I can take , and Pistol 's cock is up , And flashing fire will follow .
NYM : I am not Barbason ; you cannot conjure me . I have an humour to knock you indifferently well . If you grow foul with me , Pistol , I will scour you with my rapier , as I may , in fair terms : if you would walk off , I would prick your guts a little , in good terms , as I may : and that 's the humour of it .
PISTOL : O braggart vile and damned furious wight ! The grave doth gape , and doting death is near ; Therefore exhale .
BARDOLPH : Hear me , hear me what I say : he that strikes the first stroke , I 'll run him up to the hilts , as I am a soldier . Draws
PISTOL : An oath of mickle might ; and fury shall abate . Give me thy fist , thy fore-foot to me give : Thy spirits are most tall .
NYM : I will cut thy throat , one time or other , in fair terms : that is the humour of it .
PISTOL : ' Couple a gorge ! ' That is the word . I thee defy again . O hound of Crete , think 'st thou my spouse to get ? No ; to the spital go , And from the powdering tub of infamy Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid 's kind , Doll Tearsheet she by name , and her espouse : I have , and I will hold , the quondam Quickly For the only she ; and--pauca , there 's enough . Go to . Enter the Boy
Boy : Mine host Pistol , you must come to my master , and you , hostess : he is very sick , and would to bed . Good Bardolph , put thy face between his sheets , and do the office of a warming-pan . Faith , he 's very ill .
BARDOLPH : Away , you rogue !
Hostess : By my troth , he 'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days . The king has killed his heart . Good husband , come home presently .
BARDOLPH : Come , shall I make you two friends ? We must to France together : why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another 's throats ?
PISTOL : Let floods o 'erswell , and fiends for food howl on !
NYM : You 'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting ?
PISTOL : Base is the slave that pays .
NYM : That now I will have : that 's the humour of it .
PISTOL : As manhood shall compound : push home . They draw
