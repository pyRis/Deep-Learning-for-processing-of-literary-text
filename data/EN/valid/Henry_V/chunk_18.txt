KING HENRY V : What is thy name ? I know thy quality .
MONTJOY : Montjoy .
KING HENRY V : Thou dost thy office fairly . Turn thee back . And tell thy king I do not seek him now ; But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment : for , to say the sooth , Though ' tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage , My people are with sickness much enfeebled , My numbers lessened , and those few I have Almost no better than so many French ; Who when they were in health , I tell thee , herald , I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen . Yet , forgive me , God , That I do brag thus ! This your air of France Hath blown that vice in me : I must repent . Go therefore , tell thy master here I am ; My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk , My army but a weak and sickly guard ; Yet , God before , tell him we will come on , Though France himself and such another neighbour Stand in our way . There 's for thy labour , Montjoy . Go bid thy master well advise himself : If we may pass , we will ; if we be hinder 'd , We shall your tawny ground with your red blood Discolour : and so Montjoy , fare you well . The sum of all our answer is but this : We would not seek a battle , as we are ; Nor , as we are , we say we will not shun it : So tell your master .
MONTJOY : I shall deliver so . Thanks to your highness . Exit
GLOUCESTER : I hope they will not come upon us now .
KING HENRY V : We are in God 's hand , brother , not in theirs . March to the bridge ; it now draws toward night : Beyond the river we 'll encamp ourselves , And on to-morrow , bid them march away . Enter the Constable of France , the LORD RAMBURES , ORLEANS , DAUPHIN , with others
Constable : Tut ! I have the best armour of the world . Would it were day !
ORLEANS : You have an excellent armour ; but let my horse have his due .
Constable : It is the best horse of Europe .
ORLEANS : Will it never be morning ?
DAUPHIN : My lord of Orleans , and my lord high constable , you talk of horse and armour ?
ORLEANS : You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
DAUPHIN : What a long night is this ! I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns . Ca , ha ! he bounds from the earth , as if his entrails were hairs ; le cheval volant , the Pegasus , chez les narines de feu ! When I bestride him , I soar , I am a hawk : he trots the air ; the earth sings when he touches it ; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes .
ORLEANS : He 's of the colour of the nutmeg .
DAUPHIN : And of the heat of the ginger . It is a beast for Perseus : he is pure air and fire ; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him , but only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts him : he is indeed a horse ; and all other jades you may call beasts .
Constable : Indeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .
DAUPHIN : It is the prince of palfreys ; his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage .
ORLEANS : No more , cousin .
