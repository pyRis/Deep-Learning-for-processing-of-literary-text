SHALLOW PAGE & C : Well met , Master Ford .
FORD : Trust me , a good knot : I have good cheer at home ; and I pray you all go with me .
SHALLOW : I must excuse myself , Master Ford .
SLENDER : And so must I , sir : we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne , and I would not break with her for more money than I 'll speak of .
SHALLOW : We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender , and this day we shall have our answer .
SLENDER : I hope I have your good will , father Page .
PAGE : You have , Master Slender ; I stand wholly for you : but my wife , master doctor , is for you altogether .
DOCTOR CAIUS : Ay , be-gar ; and de maid is love-a me : my nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush .
Host : What say you to young Master Fenton ? he capers , he dances , he has eyes of youth , he writes verses , he speaks holiday , he smells April and May : he will carry 't , he will carry 't ; ' tis in his buttons ; he will carry 't .
PAGE : Not by my consent , I promise you . The gentleman is of no having : he kept company with the wild prince and Poins ; he is of too high a region ; he knows too much . No , he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance : if he take her , let him take her simply ; the wealth I have waits on my consent , and my consent goes not that way .
FORD : I beseech you heartily , some of you go home with me to dinner : besides your cheer , you shall have sport ; I will show you a monster . Master doctor , you shall go ; so shall you , Master Page ; and you , Sir Hugh .
SHALLOW : Well , fare you well : we shall have the freer wooing at Master Page 's .
DOCTOR CAIUS : Go home , John Rugby ; I come anon . Exit RUGBY
Host : Farewell , my hearts : I will to my honest knight Falstaff , and drink canary with him . Exit
FORD : I think I shall drink in pipe wine first with him ; I 'll make him dance . Will you go , gentles ?
All : Have with you to see this monster . Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS FORD : What , John ! What , Robert !
MISTRESS PAGE : Quickly , quickly ! is the buck-basket--
MISTRESS FORD : I warrant . What , Robin , I say ! Enter Servants with a basket
MISTRESS PAGE : Come , come , come .
MISTRESS FORD : Here , set it down .
MISTRESS PAGE : Give your men the charge ; we must be brief .
MISTRESS FORD : Marry , as I told you before , John and Robert , be ready here hard by in the brew-house : and when I suddenly call you , come forth , and without any pause or staggering take this basket on your shoulders : that done , trudge with it in all haste , and carry it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead , and there empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side .
MISTRESS PAGE : You will do it ?
MISTRESS FORD : I ha ' told them over and over ; they lack no direction . Be gone , and come when you are called .
MISTRESS PAGE : Here comes little Robin . Enter ROBIN
MISTRESS FORD : How now , my eyas-musket ! what news with you ?
ROBIN : My master , Sir John , is come in at your back-door , Mistress Ford , and requests your company .
MISTRESS PAGE : You little Jack-a-Lent , have you been true to us ?
ROBIN : Ay , I 'll be sworn . My master knows not of your being here and hath threatened to put me into everlasting liberty if I tell you of it ; for he swears he 'll turn me away .
