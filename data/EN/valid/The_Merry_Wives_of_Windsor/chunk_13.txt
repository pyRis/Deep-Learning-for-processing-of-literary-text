FORD : Sir , I hear you are a scholar , --I will be brief with you , --and you have been a man long known to me , though I had never so good means , as desire , to make myself acquainted with you . I shall discover a thing to you , wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection : but , good Sir John , as you have one eye upon my follies , as you hear them unfolded , turn another into the register of your own ; that I may pass with a reproof the easier , sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender .
FALSTAFF : Very well , sir ; proceed .
FORD : There is a gentlewoman in this town ; her husband 's name is Ford .
FALSTAFF : Well , sir .
FORD : I have long loved her , and , I protest to you , bestowed much on her ; followed her with a doting observance ; engrossed opportunities to meet her ; fee 'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her ; not only bought many presents to give her , but have given largely to many to know what she would have given ; briefly , I have pursued her as love hath pursued me ; which hath been on the wing of all occasions . But whatsoever I have merited , either in my mind or , in my means , meed , I am sure , I have received none ; unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite rate , and that hath taught me to say this : ' Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues ; Pursuing that that flies , and flying what pursues . ' 
FALSTAFF : Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands ?
FORD : Never .
FALSTAFF : Have you importuned her to such a purpose ?
FORD : Never .
FALSTAFF : Of what quality was your love , then ?
FORD : Like a fair house built on another man 's ground ; so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it .
FALSTAFF : To what purpose have you unfolded this to me ?
FORD : When I have told you that , I have told you all . Some say , that though she appear honest to me , yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her . Now , Sir John , here is the heart of my purpose : you are a gentleman of excellent breeding , admirable discourse , of great admittance , authentic in your place and person , generally allowed for your many war-like , court-like , and learned preparations .
FALSTAFF : O , sir !
FORD : Believe it , for you know it . There is money ; spend it , spend it ; spend more ; spend all I have ; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it , as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford 's wife : use your art of wooing ; win her to consent to you : if any man may , you may as soon as any .
FALSTAFF : Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection , that I should win what you would enjoy ? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously .
FORD : O , understand my drift . She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour , that the folly of my soul dares not present itself : she is too bright to be looked against . Now , could I could come to her with any detection in my hand , my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves : I could drive her then from the ward of her purity , her reputation , her marriage-vow , and a thousand other her defences , which now are too too strongly embattled against me . What say you to 't , Sir John ?
FALSTAFF : Master Brook , I will first make bold with your money ; next , give me your hand ; and last , as I am a gentleman , you shall , if you will , enjoy Ford 's wife .
FORD : O good sir !
