PAGE : Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes : there is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily . Enter Host How now , mine host !
Host : How now , bully-rook ! thou 'rt a gentleman . Cavaleiro-justice , I say ! Enter SHALLOW
SHALLOW : I follow , mine host , I follow . Good even and twenty , good Master Page ! Master Page , will you go with us ? we have sport in hand .
Host : Tell him , cavaleiro-justice ; tell him , bully-rook .
SHALLOW : Sir , there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor .
FORD : Good mine host o ' the Garter , a word with you . Drawing him aside
Host : What sayest thou , my bully-rook ?
SHALLOW : Will you go with us to behold it ? My merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons ; and , I think , hath appointed them contrary places ; for , believe me , I hear the parson is no jester . Hark , I will tell you what our sport shall be . They converse apart
Host : Hast thou no suit against my knight , my guest-cavaleire ?
FORD : None , I protest : but I 'll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him my name is Brook ; only for a jest .
Host : My hand , bully ; thou shalt have egress and regress ; --said I well ? --and thy name shall be Brook . It is a merry knight . Will you go , An-heires ?
SHALLOW : Have with you , mine host .
PAGE : I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier .
SHALLOW : Tut , sir , I could have told you more . In these times you stand on distance , your passes , stoccadoes , and I know not what : ' tis the heart , Master Page ; ' tis here , ' tis here . I have seen the time , with my long sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats .
Host : Here , boys , here , here ! shall we wag ?
PAGE : Have with you . I would rather hear them scold than fight .
FORD : Though Page be a secure fool , an stands so firmly on his wife 's frailty , yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily : she was in his company at Page 's house ; and what they made there , I know not . Well , I will look further into 't : and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff . If I find her honest , I lose not my labour ; if she be otherwise , ' tis labour well bestowed . Exit Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL
FALSTAFF : I will not lend thee a penny .
PISTOL : Why , then the world 's mine oyster . Which I with sword will open .
FALSTAFF : Not a penny . I have been content , sir , you should lay my countenance to pawn ; I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nym ; or else you had looked through the grate , like a geminy of baboons . I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends , you were good soldiers and tall fellows ; and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan , I took 't upon mine honour thou hadst it not .
PISTOL : Didst not thou share ? hadst thou not fifteen pence ?
