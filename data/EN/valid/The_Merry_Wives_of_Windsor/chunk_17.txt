DOCTOR CAIUS : By gar , you are de coward , de Jack dog , John ape .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Pray you let us not be laughing-stocks to other men 's humours ; I desire you in friendship , and I will one way or other make you amends . Aloud I will knog your urinals about your knave 's cockscomb for missing your meetings and appointments .
DOCTOR CAIUS : Diable ! Jack Rugby , --mine host de Jarteer , --have I not stay for him to kill him ? have I not , at de place I did appoint ?
SIR HUGH EVANS : As I am a Christians soul now , look you , this is the place appointed : I 'll be judgement by mine host of the Garter .
Host : Peace , I say , Gallia and Gaul , French and Welsh , soul-curer and body-curer !
DOCTOR CAIUS : Ay , dat is very good ; excellent .
Host : Peace , I say ! hear mine host of the Garter . Am I politic ? am I subtle ? am I a Machiavel ? Shall I lose my doctor ? no ; he gives me the potions and the motions . Shall I lose my parson , my priest , my Sir Hugh ? no ; he gives me the proverbs and the no-verbs . Give me thy hand , terrestrial ; so . Give me thy hand , celestial ; so . Boys of art , I have deceived you both ; I have directed you to wrong places : your hearts are mighty , your skins are whole , and let burnt sack be the issue . Come , lay their swords to pawn . Follow me , lads of peace ; follow , follow , follow .
SHALLOW : Trust me , a mad host . Follow , gentlemen , follow .
SLENDER : O sweet Anne Page !
DOCTOR CAIUS : Ha , do I perceive dat ? have you make-a de sot of us , ha , ha ?
SIR HUGH EVANS : This is well ; he has made us his vlouting-stog . I desire you that we may be friends ; and let us knog our prains together to be revenge on this same scall , scurvy cogging companion , the host of the Garter .
DOCTOR CAIUS : By gar , with all my heart . He promise to bring me where is Anne Page ; by gar , he deceive me too .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Well , I will smite his noddles . Pray you , follow . Enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN
MISTRESS PAGE : Nay , keep your way , little gallant ; you were wont to be a follower , but now you are a leader . Whether had you rather lead mine eyes , or eye your master 's heels ?
ROBIN : I had rather , forsooth , go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf .
MISTRESS PAGE : O , you are a flattering boy : now I see you 'll be a courtier . Enter FORD
FORD : Well met , Mistress Page . Whither go you ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Truly , sir , to see your wife . Is she at home ?
FORD : Ay ; and as idle as she may hang together , for want of company . I think , if your husbands were dead , you two would marry .
MISTRESS PAGE : Be sure of that , --two other husbands .
FORD : Where had you this pretty weather-cock ?
MISTRESS PAGE : I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of . What do you call your knight 's name , sirrah ?
ROBIN : Sir John Falstaff .
FORD : Sir John Falstaff !
MISTRESS PAGE : He , he ; I can never hit on 's name . There is such a league between my good man and he ! Is your wife at home indeed ?
FORD : Indeed she is .
MISTRESS PAGE : By your leave , sir : I am sick till I see her .
