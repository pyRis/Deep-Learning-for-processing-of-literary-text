SHALLOW : By my fidelity , this is not well , Master Ford ; this wrongs you .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Master Ford , you must pray , and not follow the imaginations of your own heart : this is jealousies .
FORD : Well , he 's not here I seek for .
PAGE : No , nor nowhere else but in your brain .
FORD : Help to search my house this one time . If I find not what I seek , show no colour for my extremity ; let me for ever be your table-sport ; let them say of me , ' As jealous as Ford , Chat searched a hollow walnut for his wife 's leman . ' Satisfy me once more ; once more search with me .
MISTRESS FORD : What , ho , Mistress Page ! come you and the old woman down ; my husband will come into the chamber .
FORD : Old woman ! what old woman 's that ?
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , it is my maid 's aunt of Brentford .
FORD : A witch , a quean , an old cozening quean ! Have I not forbid her my house ? She comes of errands , does she ? We are simple men ; we do not know what 's brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling . She works by charms , by spells , by the figure , and such daubery as this is , beyond our element we know nothing . Come down , you witch , you hag , you ; come down , I say !
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , good , sweet husband ! Good gentlemen , let him not strike the old woman . Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman 's clothes , and MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS PAGE : Come , Mother Prat ; come , give me your hand .
FORD : I 'll prat her . Beating him Out of my door , you witch , you hag , you baggage , you polecat , you runyon ! out , out ! I 'll conjure you , I 'll fortune-tell you . Exit FALSTAFF
MISTRESS PAGE : Are you not ashamed ? I think you have killed the poor woman .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , he will do it . ' Tis a goodly credit for you .
FORD : Hang her , witch !
SIR HUGH EVANS : By the yea and no , I think the ' oman is a witch indeed : I like not when a ' oman has a great peard ; I spy a great peard under his muffler .
FORD : Will you follow , gentlemen ? I beseech you , follow ; see but the issue of my jealousy : if I cry out thus upon no trail , never trust me when I open again .
PAGE : Let 's obey his humour a little further : come , gentlemen .
MISTRESS PAGE : Trust me , he beat him most pitifully .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , by the mass , that he did not ; he beat him most unpitifully , methought .
MISTRESS PAGE : I 'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o 'er the altar ; it hath done meritorious service .
MISTRESS FORD : What think you ? may we , with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience , pursue him with any further revenge ?
MISTRESS PAGE : The spirit of wantonness is , sure , scared out of him : if the devil have him not in fee-simple , with fine and recovery , he will never , I think , in the way of waste , attempt us again .
MISTRESS FORD : Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Yes , by all means ; if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband 's brains . If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted , we two will still be the ministers .
MISTRESS FORD : I 'll warrant they 'll have him publicly shamed : and methinks there would be no period to the jest , should he not be publicly shamed .
MISTRESS PAGE : Come , to the forge with it then ; shape it : I would not have things cool . Enter Host and BARDOLPH
