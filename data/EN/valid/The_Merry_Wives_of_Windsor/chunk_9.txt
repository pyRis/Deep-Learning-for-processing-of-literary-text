MISTRESS PAGE : Let 's consult together against this greasy knight . Come hither . They retire Enter FORD with PISTOL , and PAGE with NYM
FORD : Well , I hope it be not so .
PISTOL : Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs : Sir John affects thy wife .
FORD : Why , sir , my wife is not young .
PISTOL : He wooes both high and low , both rich and poor , Both young and old , one with another , Ford ; He loves the gallimaufry : Ford , perpend .
FORD : Love my wife !
PISTOL : With liver burning hot . Prevent , or go thou , Like Sir Actaeon he , with Ringwood at thy heels : O , odious is the name !
FORD : What name , sir ?
PISTOL : The horn , I say . Farewell . Take heed , have open eye , for thieves do foot by night : Take heed , ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing . Away , Sir Corporal Nym ! Believe it , Page ; he speaks sense . Exit
FORD : I will be patient ; I will find out this .
NYM : And this is true ; I like not the humour of lying . He hath wronged me in some humours : I should have borne the humoured letter to her ; but I have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity . He loves your wife ; there 's the short and the long . My name is Corporal Nym ; I speak and I avouch ; ' tis true : my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife . Adieu . I love not the humour of bread and cheese , and there 's the humour of it . Adieu . Exit
PAGE : ' The humour of it , ' quoth a ' ! here 's a fellow frights English out of his wits .
FORD : I will seek out Falstaff .
PAGE : I never heard such a drawling , affecting rogue .
FORD : If I do find it : well .
PAGE : I will not believe such a Cataian , though the priest o ' the town commended him for a true man .
FORD : ' Twas a good sensible fellow : well .
PAGE : How now , Meg ! MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward
MISTRESS PAGE : Whither go you , George ? Hark you .
MISTRESS FORD : How now , sweet Frank ! why art thou melancholy ?
FORD : I melancholy ! I am not melancholy . Get you home , go .
MISTRESS FORD : Faith , thou hast some crotchets in thy head . Now , will you go , Mistress Page ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Have with you . You 'll come to dinner , George . Aside to MISTRESS FORD Look who comes yonder : she shall be our messenger to this paltry knight .
MISTRESS FORD : Trust me , I thought on her : she 'll fit it . Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
MISTRESS PAGE : You are come to see my daughter Anne ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Ay , forsooth ; and , I pray , how does good Mistress Anne ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Go in with us and see : we have an hour 's talk with you .
PAGE : How now , Master Ford !
FORD : You heard what this knave told me , did you not ?
PAGE : Yes : and you heard what the other told me ?
FORD : Do you think there is truth in them ?
PAGE : Hang ' em , slaves ! I do not think the knight would offer it : but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men ; very rogues , now they be out of service .
FORD : Were they his men ?
PAGE : Marry , were they .
FORD : I like it never the better for that . Does he lie at the Garter ?
PAGE : Ay , marry , does he . If he should intend this voyage towards my wife , I would turn her loose to him ; and what he gets more of her than sharp words , let it lie on my head .
