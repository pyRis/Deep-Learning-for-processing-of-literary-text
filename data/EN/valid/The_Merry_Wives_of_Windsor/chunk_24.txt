FORD : And sped you , sir ?
FALSTAFF : Very ill-favoredly , Master Brook .
FORD : How so , sir ? Did she change her determination ?
FALSTAFF : No , Master Brook ; but the peaking Cornuto her husband , Master Brook , dwelling in a continual ' larum of jealousy , comes me in the instant of our encounter , after we had embraced , kissed , protested , and , as it were , spoke the prologue of our comedy ; and at his heels a rabble of his companions , thither provoked and instigated by his distemper , and , forsooth , to search his house for his wife 's love .
FORD : What , while you were there ?
FALSTAFF : While I was there .
FORD : And did he search for you , and could not find you ?
FALSTAFF : You shall hear . As good luck would have it , comes in one Mistress Page ; gives intelligence of Ford 's approach ; and , in her invention and Ford 's wife 's distraction , they conveyed me into a buck-basket .
FORD : A buck-basket !
FALSTAFF : By the Lord , a buck-basket ! rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks , socks , foul stockings , greasy napkins ; that , Master Brook , there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril .
FORD : And how long lay you there ?
FALSTAFF : Nay , you shall hear , Master Brook , what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good . Being thus crammed in the basket , a couple of Ford 's knaves , his hinds , were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane : they took me on their shoulders ; met the jealous knave their master in the door , who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket : I quaked for fear , lest the lunatic knave would have searched it ; but fate , ordaining he should be a cuckold , held his hand . Well : on went he for a search , and away went I for foul clothes . But mark the sequel , Master Brook : I suffered the pangs of three several deaths ; first , an intolerable fright , to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether ; next , to be compassed , like a good bilbo , in the circumference of a peck , hilt to point , heel to head ; and then , to be stopped in , like a strong distillation , with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease : think of that , --a man of my kidney , --think of that , --that am as subject to heat as butter ; a man of continual dissolution and thaw : it was a miracle to scape suffocation . And in the height of this bath , when I was more than half stewed in grease , like a Dutch dish , to be thrown into the Thames , and cooled , glowing hot , in that surge , like a horse-shoe ; think of that , --hissing hot , --think of that , Master Brook .
FORD : In good sadness , I am sorry that for my sake you have sufferd all this . My suit then is desperate ; you 'll undertake her no more ?
FALSTAFF : Master Brook , I will be thrown into Etna , as I have been into Thames , ere I will leave her thus . Her husband is this morning gone a-birding : I have received from her another embassy of meeting ; ' twixt eight and nine is the hour , Master Brook .
FORD : ' Tis past eight already , sir .
FALSTAFF : Is it ? I will then address me to my appointment . Come to me at your convenient leisure , and you shall know how I speed ; and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her . Adieu . You shall have her , Master Brook ; Master Brook , you shall cuckold Ford . Exit
