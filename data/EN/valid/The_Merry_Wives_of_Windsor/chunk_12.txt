FALSTAFF : Not I , I assure thee : setting the attractions of my good parts aside I have no other charms .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Blessing on your heart for 't !
FALSTAFF : But , I pray thee , tell me this : has Ford 's wife and Page 's wife acquainted each other how they love me ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : That were a jest indeed ! they have not so little grace , I hope : that were a trick indeed ! but Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page , of all loves : her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page ; and truly Master Page is an honest man . Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does : do what she will , say what she will , take all , pay all , go to bed when she list , rise when she list , all is as she will : and truly she deserves it ; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor , she is one . You must send her your page ; no remedy .
FALSTAFF : Why , I will .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Nay , but do so , then : and , look you , he may come and go between you both ; and in any case have a nay-word , that you may know one another 's mind , and the boy never need to understand any thing ; for ' tis not good that children should know any wickedness : old folks , you know , have discretion , as they say , and know the world .
FALSTAFF : Fare thee well : commend me to them both : there 's my purse ; I am yet thy debtor . Boy , go along with this woman . This news distracts me !
PISTOL : This punk is one of Cupid 's carriers : Clap on more sails ; pursue ; up with your fights : Give fire : she is my prize , or ocean whelm them all ! Exit
FALSTAFF : Sayest thou so , old Jack ? go thy ways ; I 'll make more of thy old body than I have done . Will they yet look after thee ? Wilt thou , after the expense of so much money , be now a gainer ? Good body , I thank thee . Let them say ' tis grossly done ; so it be fairly done , no matter . Enter BARDOLPH
BARDOLPH : Sir John , there 's one Master Brook below would fain speak with you , and be acquainted with you ; and hath sent your worship a morning 's draught of sack .
FALSTAFF : Brook is his name ?
BARDOLPH : Ay , sir .
FALSTAFF : Call him in . Exit BARDOLPH Such Brooks are welcome to me , that o 'erflow such liquor . Ah , ha ! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page have I encompassed you ? go to ; via ! Re-enter BARDOLPH , with FORD disguised
FORD : Bless you , sir !
FALSTAFF : And you , sir ! Would you speak with me ?
FORD : I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you .
FALSTAFF : You 're welcome . What 's your will ? Give us leave , drawer . Exit BARDOLPH
FORD : Sir , I am a gentleman that have spent much ; my name is Brook .
FALSTAFF : Good Master Brook , I desire more acquaintance of you .
FORD : Good Sir John , I sue for yours : not to charge you ; for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are : the which hath something embolden 'd me to this unseasoned intrusion ; for they say , if money go before , all ways do lie open .
FALSTAFF : Money is a good soldier , sir , and will on .
FORD : Troth , and I have a bag of money here troubles me : if you will help to bear it , Sir John , take all , or half , for easing me of the carriage .
FALSTAFF : Sir , I know not how I may deserve to be your porter .
FORD : I will tell you , sir , if you will give me the hearing .
