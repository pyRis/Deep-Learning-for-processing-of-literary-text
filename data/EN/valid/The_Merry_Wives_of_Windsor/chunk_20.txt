MISTRESS FORD : What shall I do ? There is a gentleman my dear friend ; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his peril : I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the house .
MISTRESS PAGE : For shame ! never stand ' you had rather ' and ' you had rather : ' your husband 's here at hand , bethink you of some conveyance : in the house you cannot hide him . O , how have you deceived me ! Look , here is a basket : if he be of any reasonable stature , he may creep in here ; and throw foul linen upon him , as if it were going to bucking : or--it is whiting-time --send him by your two men to Datchet-mead .
MISTRESS FORD : He 's too big to go in there . What shall I do ?
FALSTAFF : Let me see 't , let me see 't , O , let me see 't ! I 'll in , I 'll in . Follow your friend 's counsel . I 'll in .
MISTRESS PAGE : What , Sir John Falstaff ! Are these your letters , knight ?
FALSTAFF : I love thee . Help me away . Let me creep in here . I 'll never-- Gets into the basket ; they cover him with foul linen
MISTRESS PAGE : Help to cover your master , boy . Call your men , Mistress Ford . You dissembling knight !
MISTRESS FORD : What , John ! Robert ! John ! Exit ROBIN Re-enter Servants Go take up these clothes here quickly . Where 's the cowl-staff ? look , how you drumble ! Carry them to the laundress in Datchet-meat ; quickly , come . Enter FORD , PAGE , DOCTOR CAIUS , and SIR HUGH EVANS
FORD : Pray you , come near : if I suspect without cause , why then make sport at me ; then let me be your jest ; I deserve it . How now ! whither bear you this ?
Servant : To the laundress , forsooth .
MISTRESS FORD : Why , what have you to do whither they bear it ? You were best meddle with buck-washing .
FORD : Buck ! I would I could wash myself of the buck ! Buck , buck , buck ! Ay , buck ; I warrant you , buck ; and of the season too , it shall appear . Gentlemen , I have dreamed to-night ; I 'll tell you my dream . Here , here , here be my keys : ascend my chambers ; search , seek , find out : I 'll warrant we 'll unkennel the fox . Let me stop this way first . Locking the door So , now uncape .
PAGE : Good Master Ford , be contented : you wrong yourself too much .
FORD : True , Master Page . Up , gentlemen : you shall see sport anon : follow me , gentlemen . Exit
SIR HUGH EVANS : This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies .
DOCTOR CAIUS : By gar , ' tis no the fashion of France ; it is not jealous in France .
PAGE : Nay , follow him , gentlemen ; see the issue of his search .
MISTRESS PAGE : Is there not a double excellency in this ?
MISTRESS FORD : I know not which pleases me better , that my husband is deceived , or Sir John .
MISTRESS PAGE : What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket !
MISTRESS FORD : I am half afraid he will have need of washing ; so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit .
MISTRESS PAGE : Hang him , dishonest rascal ! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress .
MISTRESS FORD : I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff 's being here ; for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now .
MISTRESS PAGE : I will lay a plot to try that ; and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff : his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine .
