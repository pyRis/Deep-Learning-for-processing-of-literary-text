FALSTAFF : Ay , sir ; like who more bold .
SIMPLE : I thank your worship : I shall make my master glad with these tidings . Exit
Host : Thou art clerkly , thou art clerkly , Sir John . Was there a wise woman with thee ?
FALSTAFF : Ay , that there was , mine host ; one that hath taught me more wit than ever I learned before in my life ; and I paid nothing for it neither , but was paid for my learning . Enter BARDOLPH
BARDOLPH : Out , alas , sir ! cozenage , mere cozenage !
Host : Where be my horses ? speak well of them , varletto .
BARDOLPH : Run away with the cozeners ; for so soon as I came beyond Eton , they threw me off from behind one of them , in a slough of mire ; and set spurs and away , like three German devils , three Doctor Faustuses .
Host : They are gone but to meet the duke , villain : do not say they be fled ; Germans are honest men . Enter SIR HUGH EVANS
SIR HUGH EVANS : Where is mine host ?
Host : What is the matter , sir ?
SIR HUGH EVANS : Have a care of your entertainments : there is a friend of mine come to town tells me there is three cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of Readins , of Maidenhead , of Colebrook , of horses and money . I tell you for good will , look you : you are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks , and ' tis not convenient you should be cozened . Fare you well . Exit Enter DOCTOR CAIUS
DOCTOR CAIUS : Vere is mine host de Jarteer ?
Host : Here , master doctor , in perplexity and doubtful dilemma .
DOCTOR CAIUS : I cannot tell vat is dat : but it is tell-a me dat you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany : by my trot , dere is no duke dat the court is know to come . I tell you for good vill : adieu . Exit
Host : Hue and cry , villain , go ! Assist me , knight . I am undone ! Fly , run , hue and cry , villain ! I am undone !
FALSTAFF : I would all the world might be cozened ; for I have been cozened and beaten too . If it should come to the ear of the court , how I have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled , they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermen 's boots with me ; I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were as crest-fallen as a dried pear . I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero . Well , if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers , I would repent . Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY Now , whence come you ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : From the two parties , forsooth .
FALSTAFF : The devil take one party and his dam the other ! and so they shall be both bestowed . I have suffered more for their sakes , more than the villanous inconstancy of man 's disposition is able to bear .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : And have not they suffered ? Yes , I warrant ; speciously one of them ; Mistress Ford , good heart , is beaten black and blue , that you cannot see a white spot about her .
FALSTAFF : What tellest thou me of black and blue ? I was beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow ; and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brentford : but that my admirable dexterity of wit , my counterfeiting the action of an old woman , delivered me , the knave constable had set me i ' the stocks , i ' the common stocks , for a witch .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Sir , let me speak with you in your chamber : you shall hear how things go ; and , I warrant , to your content . Here is a letter will say somewhat . Good hearts , what ado here is to bring you together ! Sure , one of you does not serve heaven well , that you are so crossed .
