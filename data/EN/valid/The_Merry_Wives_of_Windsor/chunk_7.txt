MISTRESS QUICKLY : Alas , he speaks but for his friend .
DOCTOR CAIUS : It is no matter-a ver dat : do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself ? By gar , I vill kill de Jack priest ; and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon . By gar , I will myself have Anne Page .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Sir , the maid loves you , and all shall be well . We must give folks leave to prate : what , the good-jer !
DOCTOR CAIUS : Rugby , come to the court with me . By gar , if I have not Anne Page , I shall turn your head out of my door . Follow my heels , Rugby .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : You shall have An fool 's-head of your own . No , I know Anne 's mind for that : never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne 's mind than I do ; nor can do more than I do with her , I thank heaven .
FENTON : Who 's within there ? ho !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Who 's there , I trow ! Come near the house , I pray you . Enter FENTON
FENTON : How now , good woman ? how dost thou ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : The better that it pleases your good worship to ask .
FENTON : What news ? how does pretty Mistress Anne ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : In truth , sir , and she is pretty , and honest , and gentle ; and one that is your friend , I can tell you that by the way ; I praise heaven for it .
FENTON : Shall I do any good , thinkest thou ? shall I not lose my suit ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Troth , sir , all is in his hands above : but notwithstanding , Master Fenton , I 'll be sworn on a book , she loves you . Have not your worship a wart above your eye ?
FENTON : Yes , marry , have I ; what of that ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Well , thereby hangs a tale : good faith , it is such another Nan ; but , I detest , an honest maid as ever broke bread : we had an hour 's talk of that wart . I shall never laugh but in that maid 's company ! But indeed she is given too much to allicholy and musing : but for you--well , go to .
FENTON : Well , I shall see her to-day . Hold , there 's money for thee ; let me have thy voice in my behalf : if thou seest her before me , commend me .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Will I ? i 'faith , that we will ; and I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence ; and of other wooers .
FENTON : Well , farewell ; I am in great haste now .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Farewell to your worship . Exit FENTON Truly , an honest gentleman : but Anne loves him not ; for I know Anne 's mind as well as another does . Out upon 't ! what have I forgot ? Exit Enter MISTRESS PAGE , with a letter
