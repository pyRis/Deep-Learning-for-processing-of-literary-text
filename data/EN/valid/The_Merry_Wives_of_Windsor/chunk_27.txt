MISTRESS PAGE : Quick , quick ! we 'll come dress you straight : put on the gown the while . Exit FALSTAFF
MISTRESS FORD : I would my husband would meet him in this shape : he cannot abide the old woman of Brentford ; he swears she 's a witch ; forbade her my house and hath threatened to beat her .
MISTRESS PAGE : Heaven guide him to thy husband 's cudgel , and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards !
MISTRESS FORD : But is my husband coming ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Ah , in good sadness , is he ; and talks of the basket too , howsoever he hath had intelligence .
MISTRESS FORD : We 'll try that ; for I 'll appoint my men to carry the basket again , to meet him at the door with it , as they did last time .
MISTRESS PAGE : Nay , but he 'll be here presently : let 's go dress him like the witch of Brentford .
MISTRESS FORD : I 'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket . Go up ; I 'll bring linen for him straight . Exit
MISTRESS PAGE : Hang him , dishonest varlet ! we cannot misuse him enough . We 'll leave a proof , by that which we will do , Wives may be merry , and yet honest too : We do not act that often jest and laugh ; ' Tis old , but true , Still swine eat all the draff . Exit Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants

First Servant : Come , come , take it up .
Second Servant : Pray heaven it be not full of knight again .
First Servant : I hope not ; I had as lief bear so much lead . Enter FORD , PAGE , SHALLOW , DOCTOR CAIUS , and SIR HUGH EVANS
FORD : Ay , but if it prove true , Master Page , have you any way then to unfool me again ? Set down the basket , villain ! Somebody call my wife . Youth in a basket ! O you panderly rascals ! there 's a knot , a ging , a pack , a conspiracy against me : now shall the devil be shamed . What , wife , I say ! Come , come forth ! Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching !
PAGE : Why , this passes , Master Ford ; you are not to go loose any longer ; you must be pinioned .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Why , this is lunatics ! this is mad as a mad dog !
SHALLOW : Indeed , Master Ford , this is not well , indeed .
FORD : So say I too , sir . Re-enter MISTRESS FORD Come hither , Mistress Ford ; Mistress Ford the honest woman , the modest wife , the virtuous creature , that hath the jealous fool to her husband ! I suspect without cause , mistress , do I ?
MISTRESS FORD : Heaven be my witness you do , if you suspect me in any dishonesty .
FORD : Well said , brazen-face ! hold it out . Come forth , sirrah ! Pulling clothes out of the basket
PAGE : This passes !
MISTRESS FORD : Are you not ashamed ? let the clothes alone .
FORD : I shall find you anon .
SIR HUGH EVANS : ' Tis unreasonable ! Will you take up your wife 's clothes ? Come away .
FORD : Empty the basket , I say !
MISTRESS FORD : Why , man , why ?
FORD : Master Page , as I am a man , there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket : why may not he be there again ? In my house I am sure he is : my intelligence is true ; my jealousy is reasonable . Pluck me out all the linen .
MISTRESS FORD : If you find a man there , he shall die a flea 's death .
