SLENDER : Whoa ho ! ho , father Page !
PAGE : Son , how now ! how now , son ! have you dispatched ?
SLENDER : Dispatched ! I 'll make the best in Gloucestershire know on 't ; would I were hanged , la , else .
PAGE : Of what , son ?
SLENDER : I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page , and she 's a great lubberly boy . If it had not been i ' the church , I would have swinged him , or he should have swinged me . If I did not think it had been Anne Page , would I might never stir ! --and ' tis a postmaster 's boy .
PAGE : Upon my life , then , you took the wrong .
SLENDER : What need you tell me that ? I think so , when I took a boy for a girl . If I had been married to him , for all he was in woman 's apparel , I would not have had him .
PAGE : Why , this is your own folly . Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments ?
SLENDER : I went to her in white , and cried ' mum , ' and she cried ' budget , ' as Anne and I had appointed ; and yet it was not Anne , but a postmaster 's boy .
MISTRESS PAGE : Good George , be not angry : I knew of your purpose ; turned my daughter into green ; and , indeed , she is now with the doctor at the deanery , and there married . Enter DOCTOR CAIUS
DOCTOR CAIUS : Vere is Mistress Page ? By gar , I am cozened : I ha ' married un garcon , a boy ; un paysan , by gar , a boy ; it is not Anne Page : by gar , I am cozened .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why , did you take her in green ?
DOCTOR CAIUS : Ay , by gar , and ' tis a boy : by gar , I 'll raise all Windsor . Exit
FORD : This is strange . Who hath got the right Anne ?
PAGE : My heart misgives me : here comes Master Fenton . Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE How now , Master Fenton !
ANNE PAGE : Pardon , good father ! good my mother , pardon !
PAGE : Now , mistress , how chance you went not with Master Slender ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Why went you not with master doctor , maid ?
FENTON : You do amaze her : hear the truth of it . You would have married her most shamefully , Where there was no proportion held in love . The truth is , she and I , long since contracted , Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us . The offence is holy that she hath committed ; And this deceit loses the name of craft , Of disobedience , or unduteous title , Since therein she doth evitate and shun A thousand irreligious cursed hours , Which forced marriage would have brought upon her .
FORD : Stand not amazed ; here is no remedy : In love the heavens themselves do guide the state ; Money buys lands , and wives are sold by fate .
FALSTAFF : I am glad , though you have ta 'en a special stand to strike at me , that your arrow hath glanced .
PAGE : Well , what remedy ? Fenton , heaven give thee joy ! What cannot be eschew 'd must be embraced .
FALSTAFF : When night-dogs run , all sorts of deer are chased .
MISTRESS PAGE : Well , I will muse no further . Master Fenton , Heaven give you many , many merry days ! Good husband , let us every one go home , And laugh this sport o 'er by a country fire ; Sir John and all .
