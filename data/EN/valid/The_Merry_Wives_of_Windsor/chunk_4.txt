PAGE : Come on , sir .
SLENDER : Mistress Anne , yourself shall go first .
ANNE PAGE : Not I , sir ; pray you , keep on .
SLENDER : I 'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome . You do yourself wrong , indeed , la ! Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE
SIR HUGH EVANS : Go your ways , and ask of Doctor Caius ' house which is the way : and there dwells one Mistress Quickly , which is in the manner of his nurse , or his dry nurse , or his cook , or his laundry , his washer , and his wringer .
SIMPLE : Well , sir .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Nay , it is petter yet . Give her this letter ; for it is a ' oman that altogether 's acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page : and the letter is , to desire and require her to solicit your master 's desires to Mistress Anne Page . I pray you , be gone : I will make an end of my dinner ; there 's pippins and cheese to come . Enter FALSTAFF , Host , BARDOLPH , NYM , PISTOL , and ROBIN
FALSTAFF : Mine host of the Garter !
Host : What says my bully-rook ? speak scholarly and wisely .
FALSTAFF : Truly , mine host , I must turn away some of my followers .
Host : Discard , bully Hercules ; cashier : let them wag ; trot , trot .
FALSTAFF : I sit at ten pounds a week .
Host : Thou 'rt an emperor , Caesar , Keisar , and Pheezar . I will entertain Bardolph ; he shall draw , he shall tap : said I well , bully Hector ?
FALSTAFF : Do so , good mine host .
Host : I have spoke ; let him follow . To BARDOLPH Let me see thee froth and lime : I am at a word ; follow . Exit
FALSTAFF : Bardolph , follow him . A tapster is a good trade : an old cloak makes a new jerkin ; a withered serving-man a fresh tapster . Go ; adieu .
BARDOLPH : It is a life that I have desired : I will thrive .
PISTOL : O base Hungarian wight ! wilt thou the spigot wield ? Exit BARDOLPH
NYM : He was gotten in drink : is not the humour conceited ?
FALSTAFF : I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox : his thefts were too open ; his filching was like an unskilful singer ; he kept not time .
NYM : The good humour is to steal at a minute 's rest .
PISTOL : ' Convey , ' the wise it call . ' Steal ! ' foh ! a fico for the phrase !
FALSTAFF : Well , sirs , I am almost out at heels .
PISTOL : Why , then , let kibes ensue .
FALSTAFF : There is no remedy ; I must cony-catch ; I must shift .
PISTOL : Young ravens must have food .
FALSTAFF : Which of you know Ford of this town ?
PISTOL : I ken the wight : he is of substance good .
FALSTAFF : My honest lads , I will tell you what I am about .
PISTOL : Two yards , and more .
FALSTAFF : No quips now , Pistol ! Indeed , I am in the waist two yards about ; but I am now about no waste ; I am about thrift . Briefly , I do mean to make love to Ford 's wife : I spy entertainment in her ; she discourses , she carves , she gives the leer of invitation : I can construe the action of her familiar style ; and the hardest voice of her behavior , to be Englished rightly , is , ' I am Sir John Falstaff 's . ' 
PISTOL : He hath studied her will , and translated her will , out of honesty into English .
NYM : The anchor is deep : will that humour pass ?
FALSTAFF : Now , the report goes she has all the rule of her husband 's purse : he hath a legion of angels .
PISTOL : As many devils entertain ; and ' To her , boy , ' say I.
NYM : The humour rises ; it is good : humour me the angels .
