SIR HUGH EVANS : He is a good sprag memory . Farewell , Mistress Page .
MISTRESS PAGE : Adieu , good Sir Hugh . Exit SIR HUGH EVANS Get you home , boy . Come , we stay too long . Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD
FALSTAFF : Mistress Ford , your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance . I see you are obsequious in your love , and I profess requital to a hair 's breadth ; not only , Mistress Ford , in the simple office of love , but in all the accoutrement , complement and ceremony of it . But are you sure of your husband now ?
MISTRESS FORD : He 's a-birding , sweet Sir John .
MISTRESS PAGE : What , ho , gossip Ford ! what , ho !
MISTRESS FORD : Step into the chamber , Sir John . Exit FALSTAFF Enter MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS PAGE : How now , sweetheart ! who 's at home besides yourself ?
MISTRESS FORD : Why , none but mine own people .
MISTRESS PAGE : Indeed !
MISTRESS FORD : No , certainly . Aside to her Speak louder .
MISTRESS PAGE : Truly , I am so glad you have nobody here .
MISTRESS FORD : Why ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Why , woman , your husband is in his old lunes again : he so takes on yonder with my husband ; so rails against all married mankind ; so curses all Eve 's daughters , of what complexion soever ; and so buffets himself on the forehead , crying , ' Peer out , peer out ! ' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness , civility and patience , to this his distemper he is in now : I am glad the fat knight is not here .
MISTRESS FORD : Why , does he talk of him ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Of none but him ; and swears he was carried out , the last time he searched for him , in a basket ; protests to my husband he is now here , and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport , to make another experiment of his suspicion : but I am glad the knight is not here ; now he shall see his own foolery .
MISTRESS FORD : How near is he , Mistress Page ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Hard by ; at street end ; he will be here anon .
MISTRESS FORD : I am undone ! The knight is here .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why then you are utterly shamed , and he 's but a dead man . What a woman are you ! --Away with him , away with him ! better shame than murder .
FORD : Which way should be go ? how should I bestow him ? Shall I put him into the basket again ? Re-enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF : No , I 'll come no more i ' the basket . May I not go out ere he come ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Alas , three of Master Ford 's brothers watch the door with pistols , that none shall issue out ; otherwise you might slip away ere he came . But what make you here ?
FALSTAFF : What shall I do ? I 'll creep up into the chimney .
MISTRESS FORD : There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces . Creep into the kiln-hole .
FALSTAFF : Where is it ?
MISTRESS FORD : He will seek there , on my word . Neither press , coffer , chest , trunk , well , vault , but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places , and goes to them by his note : there is no hiding you in the house .
FALSTAFF : I 'll go out then .
MISTRESS PAGE : If you go out in your own semblance , you die , Sir John . Unless you go out disguised--
MISTRESS FORD : How might we disguise him ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Alas the day , I know not ! There is no woman 's gown big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat , a muffler and a kerchief , and so escape .
FALSTAFF : Good hearts , devise something : any extremity rather than a mischief .
MISTRESS FORD : My maid 's aunt , the fat woman of Brentford , has a gown above .
