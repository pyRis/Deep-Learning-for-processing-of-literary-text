PISTOL : Then did the sun on dunghill shine .
NYM : I thank thee for that humour .
FALSTAFF : O , she did so course o 'er my exteriors with such a greedy intention , that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass ! Here 's another letter to her : she bears the purse too ; she is a region in Guiana , all gold and bounty . I will be cheater to them both , and they shall be exchequers to me ; they shall be my East and West Indies , and I will trade to them both . Go bear thou this letter to Mistress Page ; and thou this to Mistress Ford : we will thrive , lads , we will thrive .
PISTOL : Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become , And by my side wear steel ? then , Lucifer take all !
NYM : I will run no base humour : here , take the humour-letter : I will keep the havior of reputation .
FALSTAFF : Hold , sirrah , bear you these letters tightly ; Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores . Rogues , hence , avaunt ! vanish like hailstones , go ; Trudge , plod away o ' the hoof ; seek shelter , pack ! Falstaff will learn the humour of the age , French thrift , you rogues ; myself and skirted page .
PISTOL : Let vultures gripe thy guts ! for gourd and fullam holds , And high and low beguiles the rich and poor : Tester I 'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack , Base Phrygian Turk !
NYM : I have operations which be humours of revenge .
PISTOL : Wilt thou revenge ?
NYM : By welkin and her star !
PISTOL : With wit or steel ?
NYM : With both the humours , I : I will discuss the humour of this love to Page .
PISTOL : And I to Ford shall eke unfold How Falstaff , varlet vile , His dove will prove , his gold will hold , And his soft couch defile .
NYM : My humour shall not cool : I will incense Page to deal with poison ; I will possess him with yellowness , for the revolt of mine is dangerous : that is my true humour .
PISTOL : Thou art the Mars of malecontents : I second thee ; troop on . Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY , SIMPLE , and RUGBY
MISTRESS QUICKLY : What , John Rugby ! I pray thee , go to the casement , and see if you can see my master , Master Doctor Caius , coming . If he do , i ' faith , and find any body in the house , here will be an old abusing of God 's patience and the king 's English .
RUGBY : I 'll go watch .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Go ; and we 'll have a posset for 't soon at night , in faith , at the latter end of a sea-coal fire . Exit RUGBY An honest , willing , kind fellow , as ever servant shall come in house withal , and , I warrant you , no tell-tale nor no breed-bate : his worst fault is , that he is given to prayer ; he is something peevish that way : but nobody but has his fault ; but let that pass . Peter Simple , you say your name is ?
SIMPLE : Ay , for fault of a better .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : And Master Slender 's your master ?
SIMPLE : Ay , forsooth .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Does he not wear a great round beard , like a glover 's paring-knife ?
SIMPLE : No , forsooth : he hath but a little wee face , with a little yellow beard , a Cain-coloured beard .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : A softly-sprighted man , is he not ?
SIMPLE : Ay , forsooth : but he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head ; he hath fought with a warrener .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : How say you ? O , I should remember him : does he not hold up his head , as it were , and strut in his gait ?
SIMPLE : Yes , indeed , does he .
