MISTRESS QUICKLY : Now heaven send thee good fortune ! Exit FENTON A kind heart he hath : a woman would run through fire and water for such a kind heart . But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne ; or I would Master Slender had her ; or , in sooth , I would Master Fenton had her ; I will do what I can for them all three ; for so I have promised , and I 'll be as good as my word ; but speciously for Master Fenton . Well , I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses : what a beast am I to slack it ! Exit Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF : Bardolph , I say , --
BARDOLPH : Here , sir .
FALSTAFF : Go fetch me a quart of sack ; put a toast in 't . Exit BARDOLPH Have I lived to be carried in a basket , like a barrow of butcher 's offal , and to be thrown in the Thames ? Well , if I be served such another trick , I 'll have my brains ta 'en out and buttered , and give them to a dog for a new-year 's gift . The rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch 's puppies , fifteen i ' the litter : and you may know by my size that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking ; if the bottom were as deep as hell , I should down . I had been drowned , but that the shore was shelvy and shallow , --a death that I abhor ; for the water swells a man ; and what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled ! I should have been a mountain of mummy . Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack
BARDOLPH : Here 's Mistress Quickly , sir , to speak with you .
FALSTAFF : Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water ; for my belly 's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins . Call her in .
BARDOLPH : Come in , woman ! Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
MISTRESS QUICKLY : By your leave ; I cry you mercy : give your worship good morrow .
FALSTAFF : Take away these chalices . Go brew me a pottle of sack finely .
BARDOLPH : With eggs , sir ?
FALSTAFF : Simple of itself ; I 'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage . Exit BARDOLPH How now !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Marry , sir , I come to your worship from Mistress Ford .
FALSTAFF : Mistress Ford ! I have had ford enough ; I was thrown into the ford ; I have my belly full of ford .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Alas the day ! good heart , that was not her fault : she does so take on with her men ; they mistook their erection .
FALSTAFF : So did I mine , to build upon a foolish woman 's promise .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Well , she laments , sir , for it , that it would yearn your heart to see it . Her husband goes this morning a-birding ; she desires you once more to come to her between eight and nine : I must carry her word quickly : she 'll make you amends , I warrant you .
FALSTAFF : Well , I will visit her : tell her so ; and bid her think what a man is : let her consider his frailty , and then judge of my merit .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : I will tell her .
FALSTAFF : Do so . Between nine and ten , sayest thou ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Eight and nine , sir .
FALSTAFF : Well , be gone : I will not miss her .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Peace be with you , sir . Exit
FALSTAFF : I marvel I hear not of Master Brook ; he sent me word to stay within : I like his money well . O , here he comes . Enter FORD
FORD : Bless you , sir !
FALSTAFF : Now , master Brook , you come to know what hath passed between me and Ford 's wife ?
FORD : That , indeed , Sir John , is my business .
