SHALLOW : Cousin Abraham Slender , can you love her ?
SLENDER : I hope , sir , I will do as it shall become one that would do reason .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Nay , Got 's lords and his ladies ! you must speak possitable , if you can carry her your desires towards her .
SHALLOW : That you must . Will you , upon good dowry , marry her ?
SLENDER : I will do a greater thing than that , upon your request , cousin , in any reason .
SHALLOW : Nay , conceive me , conceive me , sweet coz : what I do is to pleasure you , coz . Can you love the maid ?
SLENDER : I will marry her , sir , at your request : but if there be no great love in the beginning , yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance , when we are married and have more occasion to know one another ; I hope , upon familiarity will grow more contempt : but if you say , ' Marry her , ' I will marry her ; that I am freely dissolved , and dissolutely .
SIR HUGH EVANS : It is a fery discretion answer ; save the fall is in the ort ' dissolutely : ' the ort is , according to our meaning , ' resolutely : ' his meaning is good .
SHALLOW : Ay , I think my cousin meant well .
SLENDER : Ay , or else I would I might be hanged , la !
SHALLOW : Here comes fair Mistress Anne . Re-enter ANNE PAGE Would I were young for your sake , Mistress Anne !

SIR HUGH EVANS : Od 's plessed will ! I will not be absence at the grace .
ANNE PAGE : Will 't please your worship to come in , sir ?
SLENDER : No , I thank you , forsooth , heartily ; I am very well .
ANNE PAGE : The dinner attends you , sir .
SLENDER : I am not a-hungry , I thank you , forsooth . Go , sirrah , for all you are my man , go wait upon my cousin Shallow . Exit SIMPLE A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his friend for a man . I keep but three men and a boy yet , till my mother be dead : but what though ? Yet I live like a poor gentleman born .
ANNE PAGE : I may not go in without your worship : they will not sit till you come .
SLENDER : I ' faith , I 'll eat nothing ; I thank you as much as though I did .
ANNE PAGE : I pray you , sir , walk in .
SLENDER : I had rather walk here , I thank you . I bruised my shin th ' other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence ; three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes ; and , by my troth , I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since . Why do your dogs bark so ? be there bears i ' the town ?
ANNE PAGE : I think there are , sir ; I heard them talked of .
SLENDER : I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England . You are afraid , if you see the bear loose , are you not ?
ANNE PAGE : Ay , indeed , sir .
SLENDER : That 's meat and drink to me , now . I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times , and have taken him by the chain ; but , I warrant you , the women have so cried and shrieked at it , that it passed : but women , indeed , cannot abide ' em ; they are very ill-favored rough things .

SLENDER : I 'll eat nothing , I thank you , sir .
PAGE : By cock and pie , you shall not choose , sir ! come , come .
