PAGE : Nay , do not fly ; I think we have watch 'd you now Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn ?
MISTRESS PAGE : I pray you , come , hold up the jest no higher Now , good Sir John , how like you Windsor wives ? See you these , husband ? do not these fair yokes Become the forest better than the town ?
FORD : Now , sir , who 's a cuckold now ? Master Brook , Falstaff 's a knave , a cuckoldly knave ; here are his horns , Master Brook : and , Master Brook , he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford 's but his buck-basket , his cudgel , and twenty pounds of money , which must be paid to Master Brook ; his horses are arrested for it , Master Brook .
MISTRESS FORD : Sir John , we have had ill luck ; we could never meet . I will never take you for my love again ; but I will always count you my deer .
FALSTAFF : I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass .
FORD : Ay , and an ox too : both the proofs are extant .
FALSTAFF : And these are not fairies ? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies : and yet the guiltiness of my mind , the sudden surprise of my powers , drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief , in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason , that they were fairies . See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent , when ' tis upon ill employment !
SIR HUGH EVANS : Sir John Falstaff , serve Got , and leave your desires , and fairies will not pinse you .
FORD : Well said , fairy Hugh .
SIR HUGH EVANS : And leave your jealousies too , I pray you .
FORD : I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good English .
FALSTAFF : Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it , that it wants matter to prevent so gross o 'erreaching as this ? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too ? shall I have a coxcomb of frize ? ' Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Seese is not good to give putter ; your belly is all putter .
FALSTAFF : ' Seese ' and ' putter ' ! have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English ? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why Sir John , do you think , though we would have the virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell , that ever the devil could have made you our delight ?
FORD : What , a hodge-pudding ? a bag of flax ?
MISTRESS PAGE : A puffed man ?
PAGE : Old , cold , withered and of intolerable entrails ?
FORD : And one that is as slanderous as Satan ?
PAGE : And as poor as Job ?
FORD : And as wicked as his wife ?
SIR HUGH EVANS : And given to fornications , and to taverns and sack and wine and metheglins , and to drinkings and swearings and starings , pribbles and prabbles ?
FALSTAFF : Well , I am your theme : you have the start of me ; I am dejected ; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel ; ignorance itself is a plummet o 'er me : use me as you will .
FORD : Marry , sir , we 'll bring you to Windsor , to one Master Brook , that you have cozened of money , to whom you should have been a pander : over and above that you have suffered , I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction .
PAGE : Yet be cheerful , knight : thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house ; where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife , that now laughs at thee : tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter .
