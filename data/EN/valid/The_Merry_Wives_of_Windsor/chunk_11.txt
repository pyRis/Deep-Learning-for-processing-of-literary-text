PISTOL : I do relent : what would thou more of man ? Enter ROBIN
ROBIN : Sir , here 's a woman would speak with you .
FALSTAFF : Let her approach . Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Give your worship good morrow .
FALSTAFF : Good morrow , good wife .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Not so , an 't please your worship .
FALSTAFF : Good maid , then .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : I 'll be sworn , As my mother was , the first hour I was born .
FALSTAFF : I do believe the swearer . What with me ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two ?
FALSTAFF : Two thousand , fair woman : and I 'll vouchsafe thee the hearing .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : There is one Mistress Ford , sir : --I pray , come a little nearer this ways : --I myself dwell with master Doctor Caius , --
FALSTAFF : Well , on : Mistress Ford , you say , --
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Your worship says very true : I pray your worship , come a little nearer this ways .
FALSTAFF : I warrant thee , nobody hears ; mine own people , mine own people .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Are they so ? God bless them and make them his servants !
FALSTAFF : Well , Mistress Ford ; what of her ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Why , sir , she 's a good creature . Lord Lord ! your worship 's a wanton ! Well , heaven forgive you and all of us , I pray !
FALSTAFF : Mistress Ford ; come , Mistress Ford , --
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Marry , this is the short and the long of it ; you have brought her into such a canaries as ' tis wonderful . The best courtier of them all , when the court lay at Windsor , could never have brought her to such a canary . Yet there has been knights , and lords , and gentlemen , with their coaches , I warrant you , coach after coach , letter after letter , gift after gift ; smelling so sweetly , all musk , and so rushling , I warrant you , in silk and gold ; and in such alligant terms ; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest , that would have won any woman 's heart ; and , I warrant you , they could never get an eye-wink of her : I had myself twenty angels given me this morning ; but I defy all angels , in any such sort , as they say , but in the way of honesty : and , I warrant you , they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all : and yet there has been earls , nay , which is more , pensioners ; but , I warrant you , all is one with her .
FALSTAFF : But what says she to me ? be brief , my good she-Mercury .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Marry , she hath received your letter , for the which she thanks you a thousand times ; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven .
FALSTAFF : Ten and eleven ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Ay , forsooth ; and then you may come and see the picture , she says , that you wot of : Master Ford , her husband , will be from home . Alas ! the sweet woman leads an ill life with him : he 's a very jealousy man : she leads a very frampold life with him , good heart .
FALSTAFF : Ten and eleven . Woman , commend me to her ; I will not fail her .
