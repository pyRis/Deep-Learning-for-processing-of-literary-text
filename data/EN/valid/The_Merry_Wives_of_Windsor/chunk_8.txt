MISTRESS FORD : Mistress Page ! trust me , I was going to your house .
MISTRESS PAGE : And , trust me , I was coming to you . You look very ill .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , I 'll ne 'er believe that ; I have to show to the contrary .
MISTRESS PAGE : Faith , but you do , in my mind .
MISTRESS FORD : Well , I do then ; yet I say I could show you to the contrary . O Mistress Page , give me some counsel !
MISTRESS PAGE : What 's the matter , woman ?
MISTRESS FORD : O woman , if it were not for one trifling respect , I could come to such honour !
MISTRESS PAGE : Hang the trifle , woman ! take the honour . What is it ? dispense with trifles ; what is it ?
MISTRESS FORD : If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so , I could be knighted .
MISTRESS PAGE : What ? thou liest ! Sir Alice Ford ! These knights will hack ; and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry .
MISTRESS FORD : We burn daylight : here , read , read ; perceive how I might be knighted . I shall think the worse of fat men , as long as I have an eye to make difference of men 's liking : and yet he would not swear ; praised women 's modesty ; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness , that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words ; but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of ' Green Sleeves . ' What tempest , I trow , threw this whale , with so many tuns of oil in his belly , ashore at Windsor ? How shall I be revenged on him ? I think the best way were to entertain him with hope , till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease . Did you ever hear the like ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Letter for letter , but that the name of Page and Ford differs ! To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions , here 's the twin-brother of thy letter : but let thine inherit first ; for , I protest , mine never shall . I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters , writ with blank space for different names--sure , more , --and these are of the second edition : he will print them , out of doubt ; for he cares not what he puts into the press , when he would put us two . I had rather be a giantess , and lie under Mount Pelion . Well , I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man .
MISTRESS FORD : Why , this is the very same ; the very hand , the very words . What doth he think of us ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Nay , I know not : it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty . I 'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal ; for , sure , unless he know some strain in me , that I know not myself , he would never have boarded me in this fury .
MISTRESS FORD : ' Boarding , ' call you it ? I 'll be sure to keep him above deck .
MISTRESS PAGE : So will I if he come under my hatches , I 'll never to sea again . Let 's be revenged on him : let 's appoint him a meeting ; give him a show of comfort in his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay , till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , I will consent to act any villany against him , that may not sully the chariness of our honesty . O , that my husband saw this letter ! it would give eternal food to his jealousy .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why , look where he comes ; and my good man too : he 's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause ; and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance .
