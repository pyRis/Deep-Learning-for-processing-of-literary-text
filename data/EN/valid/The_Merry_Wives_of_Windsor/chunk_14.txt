FORD : Want no money , Sir John ; you shall want none .
FALSTAFF : Want no Mistress Ford , Master Brook ; you shall want none . I shall be with her , I may tell you , by her own appointment ; even as you came in to me , her assistant or go-between parted from me : I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven ; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth . Come you to me at night ; you shall know how I speed .
FORD : I am blest in your acquaintance . Do you know Ford , sir ?
FALSTAFF : Hang him , poor cuckoldly knave ! I know him not : yet I wrong him to call him poor ; they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money ; for the which his wife seems to me well-favored . I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue 's coffer ; and there 's my harvest-home .
FORD : I would you knew Ford , sir , that you might avoid him if you saw him .
FALSTAFF : Hang him , mechanical salt-butter rogue ! I will stare him out of his wits ; I will awe him with my cudgel : it shall hang like a meteor o 'er the cuckold 's horns . Master Brook , thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant , and thou shalt lie with his wife . Come to me soon at night . Ford 's a knave , and I will aggravate his style ; thou , Master Brook , shalt know him for knave and cuckold . Come to me soon at night . Exit
FORD : What a damned Epicurean rascal is this ! My heart is ready to crack with impatience . Who says this is improvident jealousy ? my wife hath sent to him ; the hour is fixed ; the match is made . Would any man have thought this ? See the hell of having a false woman ! My bed shall be abused , my coffers ransacked , my reputation gnawn at ; and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong , but stand under the adoption of abominable terms , and by him that does me this wrong . Terms ! names ! Amaimon sounds well ; Lucifer , well ; Barbason , well ; yet they are devils ' additions , the names of fiends : but Cuckold ! Wittol ! --Cuckold ! the devil himself hath not such a name . Page is an ass , a secure ass : he will trust his wife ; he will not be jealous . I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter , Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese , an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle , or a thief to walk my ambling gelding , than my wife with herself ; then she plots , then she ruminates , then she devises ; and what they think in their hearts they may effect , they will break their hearts but they will effect . God be praised for my jealousy ! Eleven o 'clock the hour . I will prevent this , detect my wife , be revenged on Falstaff , and laugh at Page . I will about it ; better three hours too soon than a minute too late . Fie , fie , fie ! cuckold ! cuckold ! cuckold ! Exit Enter DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY
