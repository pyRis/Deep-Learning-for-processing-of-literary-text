MISTRESS FORD : Do so . Go tell thy master I am alone . Exit ROBIN Mistress Page , remember you your cue .
MISTRESS PAGE : I warrant thee ; if I do not act it , hiss me . Exit
MISTRESS FORD : Go to , then : we 'll use this unwholesome humidity , this gross watery pumpion ; we 'll teach him to know turtles from jays . Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF : Have I caught thee , my heavenly jewel ? Why , now let me die , for I have lived long enough : this is the period of my ambition : O this blessed hour !
MISTRESS FORD : O sweet Sir John !
FALSTAFF : Mistress Ford , I cannot cog , I cannot prate , Mistress Ford . Now shall I sin in my wish : I would thy husband were dead : I 'll speak it before the best lord ; I would make thee my lady .
MISTRESS FORD : I your lady , Sir John ! alas , I should be a pitiful lady !
FALSTAFF : Let the court of France show me such another . I see how thine eye would emulate the diamond : thou hast the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the ship-tire , the tire-valiant , or any tire of Venetian admittance .
MISTRESS FORD : A plain kerchief , Sir John : my brows become nothing else ; nor that well neither .
FALSTAFF : By the Lord , thou art a traitor to say so : thou wouldst make an absolute courtier ; and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale . I see what thou wert , if Fortune thy foe were not , Nature thy friend . Come , thou canst not hide it .
MISTRESS FORD : Believe me , there is no such thing in me .
FALSTAFF : What made me love thee ? let that persuade thee there 's something extraordinary in thee . Come , I cannot cog and say thou art this and that , like a many of these lisping hawthorn-buds , that come like women in men 's apparel , and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time ; I cannot : but I love thee ; none but thee ; and thou deservest it .
MISTRESS FORD : Do not betray me , sir . I fear you love Mistress Page .
FALSTAFF : Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter-gate , which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln .
MISTRESS FORD : Well , heaven knows how I love you ; and you shall one day find it .
FALSTAFF : Keep in that mind ; I 'll deserve it .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , I must tell you , so you do ; or else I could not be in that mind .
ROBIN : Mistress Ford , Mistress Ford ! here 's Mistress Page at the door , sweating and blowing and looking wildly , and would needs speak with you presently .
FALSTAFF : She shall not see me : I will ensconce me behind the arras .
MISTRESS FORD : Pray you , do so : she 's a very tattling woman . FALSTAFF hides himself Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN What 's the matter ? how now !
MISTRESS PAGE : O Mistress Ford , what have you done ? You 're shamed , you 're overthrown , you 're undone for ever !
MISTRESS FORD : What 's the matter , good Mistress Page ?
MISTRESS PAGE : O well-a-day , Mistress Ford ! having an honest man to your husband , to give him such cause of suspicion !
MISTRESS FORD : What cause of suspicion ?
MISTRESS PAGE : What cause of suspicion ! Out pon you ! how am I mistook in you !
MISTRESS FORD : Why , alas , what 's the matter ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Your husband 's coming hither , woman , with all the officers in Windsor , to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house by your consent , to take an ill advantage of his assence : you are undone .
MISTRESS FORD : ' Tis not so , I hope .
