PAGE : Come , come ; we 'll couch i ' the castle-ditch till we see the light of our fairies . Remember , son Slender , my daughter .
SLENDER : Ay , forsooth ; I have spoke with her and we have a nay-word how to know one another : I come to her in white , and cry ' mum ; ' she cries ' budget ; ' and by that we know one another .
SHALLOW : That 's good too : but what needs either your ' mum ' or her ' budget ? ' the white will decipher her well enough . It hath struck ten o 'clock .
PAGE : The night is dark ; light and spirits will become it well . Heaven prosper our sport ! No man means evil but the devil , and we shall know him by his horns . Let 's away ; follow me . Enter MISTRESS PAGE , MISTRESS FORD , and DOCTOR CAIUS
MISTRESS PAGE : Master doctor , my daughter is in green : when you see your time , take her by the band , away with her to the deanery , and dispatch it quickly . Go before into the Park : we two must go together .
DOCTOR CAIUS : I know vat I have to do . Adieu .
MISTRESS PAGE : Fare you well , sir . Exit DOCTOR CAIUS My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor 's marrying my daughter : but ' tis no matter ; better a little chiding than a great deal of heart-break .
MISTRESS FORD : Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies , and the Welsh devil Hugh ?
MISTRESS PAGE : They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne 's oak , with obscured lights ; which , at the very instant of Falstaff 's and our meeting , they will at once display to the night .
MISTRESS FORD : That cannot choose but amaze him .
MISTRESS PAGE : If he be not amazed , he will be mocked ; if he be amazed , he will every way be mocked .
MISTRESS FORD : We 'll betray him finely .
MISTRESS PAGE : Against such lewdsters and their lechery Those that betray them do no treachery .
MISTRESS FORD : The hour draws on . To the oak , to the oak ! Enter SIR HUGH EVANS , disguised , with others as Fairies
SIR HUGH EVANS : Trib , trib , fairies ; come ; and remember your parts : be pold , I pray you ; follow me into the pit ; and when I give the watch- ' ords , do as I pid you : come , come ; trib , trib . Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne
FALSTAFF : The Windsor bell hath struck twelve ; the minute draws on . Now , the hot-blooded gods assist me ! Remember , Jove , thou wast a bull for thy Europa ; love set on thy horns . O powerful love ! that , in some respects , makes a beast a man , in some other , a man a beast . You were also , Jupiter , a swan for the love of Leda . O omnipotent Love ! how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose ! A fault done first in the form of a beast . O Jove , a beastly fault ! And then another fault in the semblance of a fowl ; think on ' t , Jove ; a foul fault ! When gods have hot backs , what shall poor men do ? For me , I am here a Windsor stag ; and the fattest , I think , i ' the forest . Send me a cool rut-time , Jove , or who can blame me to piss my tallow ? Who comes here ? my doe ? Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS FORD : Sir John ! art thou there , my deer ? my male deer ?
FALSTAFF : My doe with the black scut ! Let the sky rain potatoes ; let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves , hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes ; let there come a tempest of provocation , I will shelter me here .
MISTRESS FORD : Mistress Page is come with me , sweetheart .
