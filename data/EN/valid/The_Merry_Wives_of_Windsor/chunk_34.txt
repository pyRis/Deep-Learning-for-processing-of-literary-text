MISTRESS PAGE : Alas , what noise ?
MISTRESS FORD : Heaven forgive our sins
FALSTAFF : What should this be ?
MISTRESS FORD MISTRESS PAGE : Away , away ! They run off
FALSTAFF : I think the devil will not have me damned , lest the oil that 's in me should set hell on fire ; he would never else cross me thus . Enter SIR HUGH EVANS , disguised as before ; PISTOL , as Hobgoblin ; MISTRESS QUICKLY , ANNE PAGE , and others , as Fairies , with tapers
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Fairies , black , grey , green , and white , You moonshine revellers and shades of night , You orphan heirs of fixed destiny , Attend your office and your quality . Crier Hobgoblin , make the fairy oyes .
PISTOL : Elves , list your names ; silence , you airy toys . Cricket , to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap : Where fires thou find 'st unraked and hearths unswept , There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry : Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery .
FALSTAFF : They are fairies ; he that speaks to them shall die : I 'll wink and couch : no man their works must eye . Lies down upon his face
SIR HUGH EVANS : Where 's Bede ? Go you , and where you find a maid That , ere she sleep , has thrice her prayers said , Raise up the organs of her fantasy ; Sleep she as sound as careless infancy : But those as sleep and think not on their sins , Pinch them , arms , legs , backs , shoulders , sides and shins .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : About , about ; Search Windsor Castle , elves , within and out : Strew good luck , ouphes , on every sacred room : That it may stand till the perpetual doom , In state as wholesome as in state ' tis fit , Worthy the owner , and the owner it . The several chairs of order look you scour With juice of balm and every precious flower : Each fair instalment , coat , and several crest , With loyal blazon , evermore be blest ! And nightly , meadow-fairies , look you sing , Like to the Garter 's compass , in a ring : The expressure that it bears , green let it be , More fertile-fresh than all the field to see ; And ' Honi soit qui mal y pense ' write In emerald tufts , flowers purple , blue and white ; Let sapphire , pearl and rich embroidery , Buckled below fair knighthood 's bending knee : Fairies use flowers for their charactery . Away ; disperse : but till ' tis one o 'clock , Our dance of custom round about the oak Of Herne the hunter , let us not forget .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Pray you , lock hand in hand ; yourselves in order set And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be , To guide our measure round about the tree . But , stay ; I smell a man of middle-earth .
FALSTAFF : Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy , lest he transform me to a piece of cheese !
PISTOL : Vile worm , thou wast o 'erlook 'd even in thy birth .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : With trial-fire touch me his finger-end : If he be chaste , the flame will back descend And turn him to no pain ; but if he start , It is the flesh of a corrupted heart .
PISTOL : A trial , come .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Come , will this wood take fire ? They burn him with their tapers
FALSTAFF : Oh , Oh , Oh !
