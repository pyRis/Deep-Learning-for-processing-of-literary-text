PRINCE HENRY : Peace , ye fat-guts ! lie down ; lay thine ear close to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread of travellers .
FALSTAFF : Have you any levers to lift me up again , being down ? ' Sblood , I 'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin in thy father 's exchequer . What a plague mean ye to colt me thus ?
PRINCE HENRY : Thou liest ; thou art not colted , thou art uncolted .
FALSTAFF : I prithee , good Prince Hal , help me to my horse , good king 's son .
PRINCE HENRY : Out , ye rogue ! shall I be your ostler ?
FALSTAFF : Go , hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters ! If I be ta 'en , I 'll peach for this . An I have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy tunes , let a cup of sack be my poison : when a jest is so forward , and afoot too ! I hate it . Enter GADSHILL , BARDOLPH and PETO
GADSHILL : Stand .
FALSTAFF : So I do , against my will .
POINS : O , ' tis our setter : I know his voice . Bardolph , what news ?
BARDOLPH : Case ye , case ye ; on with your vizards : there ' s money of the king 's coming down the hill ; ' tis going to the king 's exchequer .
FALSTAFF : You lie , ye rogue ; ' tis going to the king 's tavern .
GADSHILL : There 's enough to make us all .
FALSTAFF : To be hanged .
PRINCE HENRY : Sirs , you four shall front them in the narrow lane ; Ned Poins and I will walk lower : if they ' scape from your encounter , then they light on us .
PETO : How many be there of them ?
GADSHILL : Some eight or ten .
FALSTAFF : ' Zounds , will they not rob us ?
PRINCE HENRY : What , a coward , Sir John Paunch ?
FALSTAFF : Indeed , I am not John of Gaunt , your grandfather ; but yet no coward , Hal .
PRINCE HENRY : Well , we leave that to the proof .
POINS : Sirrah Jack , thy horse stands behind the hedge : when thou needest him , there thou shalt find him . Farewell , and stand fast .
FALSTAFF : Now cannot I strike him , if I should be hanged .
PRINCE HENRY : Ned , where are our disguises ?
POINS : Here , hard by : stand close .
FALSTAFF : Now , my masters , happy man be his dole , say I : every man to his business . Enter the Travellers
First Traveller : Come , neighbour : the boy shall lead our horses down the hill ; we 'll walk afoot awhile , and ease our legs .
Thieves : Stand !
Travellers : Jesus bless us !
FALSTAFF : Strike ; down with them ; cut the villains ' throats : ah ! whoreson caterpillars ! bacon-fed knaves ! they hate us youth : down with them : fleece them .
Travellers : O , we are undone , both we and ours for ever !
FALSTAFF : Hang ye , gorbellied knaves , are ye undone ? No , ye fat chuffs : I would your store were here ! On , bacons , on ! What , ye knaves ! young men must live . You are Grand-jurors , are ye ? we 'll jure ye , ' faith . Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
PRINCE HENRY : The thieves have bound the true men . Now could thou and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London , it would be argument for a week , laughter for a month and a good jest for ever .
POINS : Stand close ; I hear them coming . Enter the Thieves again
FALSTAFF : Come , my masters , let us share , and then to horse before day . An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards , there 's no equity stirring : there 's no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck .
PRINCE HENRY : Your money !
