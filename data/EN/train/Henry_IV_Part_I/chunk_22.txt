LADY PERCY : I will not sing .
HOTSPUR : ' Tis the next way to turn tailor , or be red-breast teacher . An the indentures be drawn , I 'll away within these two hours ; and so , come in when ye will . Exit
GLENDOWER : Come , come , Lord Mortimer ; you are as slow As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go . By this our book is drawn ; we 'll but seal , And then to horse immediately .
MORTIMER : With all my heart . Enter KING HENRY IV , PRINCE HENRY , and others
KING HENRY IV : Lords , give us leave ; the Prince of Wales and I Must have some private conference ; but be near at hand , For we shall presently have need of you . I know not whether God will have it so , For some displeasing service I have done , That , in his secret doom , out of my blood He 'll breed revengement and a scourge for me ; But thou dost in thy passages of life Make me believe that thou art only mark 'd For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven To punish my mistreadings . Tell me else , Could such inordinate and low desires , Such poor , such bare , such lewd , such mean attempts , Such barren pleasures , rude society , As thou art match 'd withal and grafted to , Accompany the greatness of thy blood And hold their level with thy princely heart ?
PRINCE HENRY : So please your majesty , I would I could Quit all offences with as clear excuse As well as I am doubtless I can purge Myself of many I am charged withal : Yet such extenuation let me beg , As , in reproof of many tales devised , which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear , By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers , I may , for some things true , wherein my youth Hath faulty wander 'd and irregular , Find pardon on my true submission .
