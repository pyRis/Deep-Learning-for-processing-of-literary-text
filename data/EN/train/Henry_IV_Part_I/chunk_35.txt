LANCASTER : Not I , my lord , unless I did bleed too .
PRINCE HENRY : I beseech your majesty , make up , Lest your retirement do amaze your friends .
KING HENRY IV : I will do so . My Lord of Westmoreland , lead him to his tent .
WESTMORELAND : Come , my lord , I 'll lead you to your tent .
PRINCE HENRY : Lead me , my lord ? I do not need your help : And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive The Prince of Wales from such a field as this , Where stain 'd nobility lies trodden on , and rebels ' arms triumph in massacres !
LANCASTER : We breathe too long : come , cousin Westmoreland , Our duty this way lies ; for God 's sake come .
PRINCE HENRY : By God , thou hast deceived me , Lancaster ; I did not think thee lord of such a spirit : Before , I loved thee as a brother , John ; But now , I do respect thee as my soul .
KING HENRY IV : I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point With lustier maintenance than I did look for Of such an ungrown warrior .
PRINCE HENRY : O , this boy Lends mettle to us all ! Exit Enter DOUGLAS
EARL OF DOUGLAS : Another king ! they grow like Hydra 's heads : I am the Douglas , fatal to all those That wear those colours on them : what art thou , That counterfeit 'st the person of a king ?
KING HENRY IV : The king himself ; who , Douglas , grieves at heart So many of his shadows thou hast met And not the very king . I have two boys Seek Percy and thyself about the field : But , seeing thou fall 'st on me so luckily , I will assay thee : so , defend thyself .
EARL OF DOUGLAS : I fear thou art another counterfeit ; And yet , in faith , thou bear 'st thee like a king : But mine I am sure thou art , whoe 'er thou be , And thus I win thee . They fight . KING HENRY being in danger , PRINCE HENRY enters
PRINCE HENRY : Hold up thy head , vile Scot , or thou art like Never to hold it up again ! the spirits Of valiant Shirley , Stafford , Blunt , are in my arms : It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee ; Who never promiseth but he means to pay . They fight : DOUGLAS flies Cheerly , my lord how fares your grace ? Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent , And so hath Clifton : I 'll to Clifton straight .
KING HENRY IV : Stay , and breathe awhile : Thou hast redeem 'd thy lost opinion , And show 'd thou makest some tender of my life , In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me .
PRINCE HENRY : O God ! they did me too much injury That ever said I hearken 'd for your death . If it were so , I might have let alone The insulting hand of Douglas over you , Which would have been as speedy in your end As all the poisonous potions in the world And saved the treacherous labour of your son .
KING HENRY IV : Make up to Clifton : I 'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey . Exit Enter HOTSPUR
HOTSPUR : If I mistake not , thou art Harry Monmouth .
PRINCE HENRY : Thou speak 'st as if I would deny my name .
HOTSPUR : My name is Harry Percy .
PRINCE HENRY : Why , then I see A very valiant rebel of the name . I am the Prince of Wales ; and think not , Percy , To share with me in glory any more : Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere ; Nor can one England brook a double reign , Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales .
HOTSPUR : Nor shall it , Harry ; for the hour is come To end the one of us ; and would to God Thy name in arms were now as great as mine !
