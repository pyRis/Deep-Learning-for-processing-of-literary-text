SIR MICHAEL : Why , my good lord , you need not fear ; There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : No , Mortimer is not there .
SIR MICHAEL : But there is Mordake , Vernon , Lord Harry Percy , And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head Of gallant warriors , noble gentlemen .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : And so there is : but yet the king hath drawn The special head of all the land together : The Prince of Wales , Lord John of Lancaster , The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt ; And moe corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms .
SIR MICHAEL : Doubt not , my lord , they shall be well opposed .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : I hope no less , yet needful ' tis to fear ; And , to prevent the worst , Sir Michael , speed : For if Lord Percy thrive not , ere the king Dismiss his power , he means to visit us , For he hath heard of our confederacy , And ' tis but wisdom to make strong against him : Therefore make haste . I must go write again To other friends ; and so farewell , Sir Michael . Enter KING HENRY , PRINCE HENRY , Lord John of LANCASTER , EARL OF WESTMORELAND , SIR WALTER BLUNT , and FALSTAFF
KING HENRY IV : How bloodily the sun begins to peer Above yon busky hill ! the day looks pale At his distemperature .
PRINCE HENRY : The southern wind Doth play the trumpet to his purposes , And by his hollow whistling in the leaves Foretells a tempest and a blustering day .
KING HENRY IV : Then with the losers let it sympathize , For nothing can seem foul to those that win . The trumpet sounds Enter WORCESTER and VERNON How now , my Lord of Worcester ! ' tis not well That you and I should meet upon such terms As now we meet . You have deceived our trust , And made us doff our easy robes of peace , To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel : This is not well , my lord , this is not well . What say you to it ? will you again unknit This curlish knot of all-abhorred war ? And move in that obedient orb again Where you did give a fair and natural light , And be no more an exhaled meteor , A prodigy of fear and a portent Of broached mischief to the unborn times ?
EARL OF WORCESTER : Hear me , my liege : For mine own part , I could be well content To entertain the lag-end of my life With quiet hours ; for I do protest , I have not sought the day of this dislike .
KING HENRY IV : You have not sought it ! how comes it , then ?
FALSTAFF : Rebellion lay in his way , and he found it .
PRINCE HENRY : Peace , chewet , peace !
