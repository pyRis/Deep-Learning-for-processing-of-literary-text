OCTAVIUS : All that served Brutus , I will entertain them . Fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
STRATO : Ay , if Messala will prefer me to you .
OCTAVIUS : Do so , good Messala .
MESSALA : How died my master , Strato ?
STRATO : I held the sword , and he did run on it .
MESSALA : Octavius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest service to my master .
ANTONY : This was the noblest Roman of them all : All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar ; He only , in a general honest thought And common good to all , made one of them . His life was gentle , and the elements So mix 'd in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world ' This was a man ! '
