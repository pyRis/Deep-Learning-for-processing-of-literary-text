Poet : Let me go in to see the generals ; There is some grudge between ' em , ' tis not meet They be alone .
LUCILIUS : You shall not come to them .
Poet : Nothing but death shall stay me . Enter Poet , followed by LUCILIUS , TITINIUS , and LUCIUS
CASSIUS : How now ! what 's the matter ?
Poet : For shame , you generals ! what do you mean ? Love , and be friends , as two such men should be ; For I have seen more years , I 'm sure , than ye .
CASSIUS : Ha , ha ! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme !
BRUTUS : Get you hence , sirrah ; saucy fellow , hence !
CASSIUS : Bear with him , Brutus ; ' tis his fashion .
BRUTUS : I 'll know his humour , when he knows his time : What should the wars do with these jigging fools ? Companion , hence !
CASSIUS : Away , away , be gone . Exit Poet
BRUTUS : Lucilius and Titinius , bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies to-night .
CASSIUS : And come yourselves , and bring Messala with you Immediately to us .
BRUTUS : Lucius , a bowl of wine ! Exit LUCIUS
CASSIUS : I did not think you could have been so angry .
BRUTUS : O Cassius , I am sick of many griefs .
CASSIUS : Of your philosophy you make no use , If you give place to accidental evils .
BRUTUS : No man bears sorrow better . Portia is dead .
CASSIUS : Ha ! Portia !
BRUTUS : She is dead .
CASSIUS : How ' scaped I killing when I cross 'd you so ? O insupportable and touching loss ! Upon what sickness ?
BRUTUS : Impatient of my absence , And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong : --for with her death That tidings came ; --with this she fell distract , And , her attendants absent , swallow 'd fire .
CASSIUS : And died so ?
BRUTUS : Even so .
CASSIUS : O ye immortal gods ! Re-enter LUCIUS , with wine and taper
BRUTUS : Speak no more of her . Give me a bowl of wine . In this I bury all unkindness , Cassius .
CASSIUS : My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge . Fill , Lucius , till the wine o 'erswell the cup ; I cannot drink too much of Brutus ' love .
BRUTUS : Come in , Titinius ! Exit LUCIUS Re-enter TITINIUS , with MESSALA Welcome , good Messala . Now sit we close about this taper here , And call in question our necessities .
CASSIUS : Portia , art thou gone ?
BRUTUS : No more , I pray you . Messala , I have here received letters , That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power , Bending their expedition toward Philippi .
MESSALA : Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .
BRUTUS : With what addition ?
MESSALA : That by proscription and bills of outlawry , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus , Have put to death an hundred senators .
BRUTUS : Therein our letters do not well agree ; Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions , Cicero being one .
CASSIUS : Cicero one !
MESSALA : Cicero is dead , And by that order of proscription . Had you your letters from your wife , my lord ?
BRUTUS : No , Messala .
MESSALA : Nor nothing in your letters writ of her ?
BRUTUS : Nothing , Messala .
MESSALA : That , methinks , is strange .
BRUTUS : Why ask you ? hear you aught of her in yours ?
MESSALA : No , my lord .
BRUTUS : Now , as you are a Roman , tell me true .
MESSALA : Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell : For certain she is dead , and by strange manner .
BRUTUS : Why , farewell , Portia . We must die , Messala : With meditating that she must die once , I have the patience to endure it now .
MESSALA : Even so great men great losses should endure .
