PORTIA : I must go in . Ay me , how weak a thing The heart of woman is ! O Brutus , The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise ! Sure , the boy heard me : Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant . O , I grow faint . Run , Lucius , and commend me to my lord ; Say I am merry : come to me again , And bring me word what he doth say to thee . A crowd of people ; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the Soothsayer . Flourish . Enter CAESAR , BRUTUS , CASSIUS , CASCA , DECIUS BRUTUS , METELLUS CIMBER , TREBONIUS , CINNA , ANTONY , LEPIDUS , POPILIUS , PUBLIUS , and others
CAESAR : The ides of March are come .
Soothsayer : Ay , Caesar ; but not gone .
ARTEMIDORUS : Hail , Caesar ! read this schedule .
DECIUS BRUTUS : Trebonius doth desire you to o 'erread , At your best leisure , this his humble suit .
ARTEMIDORUS : O Caesar , read mine first ; for mine 's a suit That touches Caesar nearer : read it , great Caesar .
CAESAR : What touches us ourself shall be last served .
ARTEMIDORUS : Delay not , Caesar ; read it instantly .
CAESAR : What , is the fellow mad ?
PUBLIUS : Sirrah , give place .
CASSIUS : What , urge you your petitions in the street ? Come to the Capitol . CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House , the rest following
POPILIUS : I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive .
CASSIUS : What enterprise , Popilius ?
POPILIUS : Fare you well . Advances to CAESAR
BRUTUS : What said Popilius Lena ?
CASSIUS : He wish 'd to-day our enterprise might thrive . I fear our purpose is discovered .
BRUTUS : Look , how he makes to Caesar ; mark him .
CASSIUS : Casca , be sudden , for we fear prevention . Brutus , what shall be done ? If this be known , Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back , For I will slay myself .
BRUTUS : Cassius , be constant : Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes ; For , look , he smiles , and Caesar doth not change .
CASSIUS : Trebonius knows his time ; for , look you , Brutus . He draws Mark Antony out of the way .
DECIUS BRUTUS : Where is Metellus Cimber ? Let him go , And presently prefer his suit to Caesar .
BRUTUS : He is address 'd : press near and second him .
CINNA : Casca , you are the first that rears your hand .
CAESAR : Are we all ready ? What is now amiss That Caesar and his senate must redress ?
METELLUS CIMBER : Most high , most mighty , and most puissant Caesar , Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart , -- Kneeling
CAESAR : I must prevent thee , Cimber . These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men , And turn pre-ordinance and first decree Into the law of children . Be not fond , To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thaw 'd from the true quality With that which melteth fools ; I mean , sweet words , Low-crooked court 'sies and base spaniel-fawning . Thy brother by decree is banished : If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him , I spurn thee like a cur out of my way . Know , Caesar doth not wrong , nor without cause Will he be satisfied .
METELLUS CIMBER : Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar 's ear For the repealing of my banish 'd brother ?
BRUTUS : I kiss thy hand , but not in flattery , Caesar ; Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal .
CAESAR : What , Brutus !
CASSIUS : Pardon , Caesar ; Caesar , pardon : As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall , To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber .
