KING RICHARD III : Infer fair England 's peace by this alliance .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Which she shall purchase with still lasting war .
KING RICHARD III : Say that the king , which may command , entreats .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : That at her hands which the king 's King forbids .
KING RICHARD III : Say , she shall be a high and mighty queen .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : To wail the tide , as her mother doth .
KING RICHARD III : Say , I will love her everlastingly .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : But how long shall that title ' ever ' last ?
KING RICHARD III : Sweetly in force unto her fair life 's end .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last ?
KING RICHARD III : So long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : So long as hell and Richard likes of it .
KING RICHARD III : Say , I , her sovereign , am her subject love .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : But she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
KING RICHARD III : Be eloquent in my behalf to her .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : An honest tale speeds best being plainly told .
KING RICHARD III : Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Plain and not honest is too harsh a style .
KING RICHARD III : Your reasons are too shallow and too quick .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : O no , my reasons are too deep and dead ; Too deep and dead , poor infants , in their grave .
KING RICHARD III : Harp not on that string , madam ; that is past .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break .
KING RICHARD III : Now , by my George , my garter , and my crown , --
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Profaned , dishonour 'd , and the third usurp 'd .
KING RICHARD III : I swear--
QUEEN ELIZABETH : By nothing ; for this is no oath : The George , profaned , hath lost his holy honour ; The garter , blemish 'd , pawn 'd his knightly virtue ; The crown , usurp 'd , disgraced his kingly glory. if something thou wilt swear to be believed , Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong 'd .
KING RICHARD III : Now , by the world--
QUEEN ELIZABETH : ' Tis full of thy foul wrongs .
KING RICHARD III : My father 's death--
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Thy life hath that dishonour 'd .
KING RICHARD III : Then , by myself--
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Thyself thyself misusest .
KING RICHARD III : Why then , by God--
QUEEN ELIZABETH : God 's wrong is most of all . If thou hadst fear 'd to break an oath by Him , The unity the king thy brother made Had not been broken , nor my brother slain : If thou hadst fear 'd to break an oath by Him , The imperial metal , circling now thy brow , Had graced the tender temples of my child , And both the princes had been breathing here , Which now , two tender playfellows to dust , Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms . What canst thou swear by now ?
KING RICHARD III : The time to come .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : That thou hast wronged in the time o 'erpast ; For I myself have many tears to wash Hereafter time , for time past wrong 'd by thee . The children live , whose parents thou hast slaughter 'd , Ungovern 'd youth , to wail it in their age ; The parents live , whose children thou hast butcher 'd , Old wither 'd plants , to wail it with their age . Swear not by time to come ; for that thou hast Misused ere used , by time misused o 'erpast .
