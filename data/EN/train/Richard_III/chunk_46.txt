RATCLIFF : That he was never trained up in arms .
KING RICHARD III : He said the truth : and what said Surrey then ?
RATCLIFF : He smiled and said ' The better for our purpose . '

RATCLIFF : My lord ?
KING RICHARD III : The sun will not be seen to-day ; The sky doth frown and lour upon our army . I would these dewy tears were from the ground . Not shine to-day ! Why , what is that to me More than to Richmond ? for the selfsame heaven That frowns on me looks sadly upon him . Enter NORFOLK
NORFOLK : Arm , arm , my lord ; the foe vaunts in the field .
KING RICHARD III : Come , bustle , bustle ; caparison my horse . Call up Lord Stanley , bid him bring his power : I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain , And thus my battle shall be ordered : My foreward shall be drawn out all in length , Consisting equally of horse and foot ; Our archers shall be placed in the midst John Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Earl of Surrey , Shall have the leading of this foot and horse . They thus directed , we will follow In the main battle , whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse . This , and Saint George to boot ! What think 'st thou , Norfolk ?
NORFOLK : A good direction , warlike sovereign . This found I on my tent this morning . He sheweth him a paper
