HASTINGS : I thank thee , good Sir John , with all my heart . I am in your debt for your last exercise ; Come the next Sabbath , and I will content you . He whispers in his ear Enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM : What , talking with a priest , lord chamberlain ? Your friends at Pomfret , they do need the priest ; Your honour hath no shriving work in hand .
HASTINGS : Good faith , and when I met this holy man , Those men you talk of came into my mind . What , go you toward the Tower ?
BUCKINGHAM : I do , my lord ; but long I shall not stay I shall return before your lordship thence .
HASTINGS : ' Tis like enough , for I stay dinner there .
BUCKINGHAM : And supper too , although thou know 'st it not . Come , will you go ?
HASTINGS : I 'll wait upon your lordship . Enter RATCLIFF , with halberds , carrying RIVERS , GREY , and VAUGHAN to death
RATCLIFF : Come , bring forth the prisoners .
RIVERS : Sir Richard Ratcliff , let me tell thee this : To-day shalt thou behold a subject die For truth , for duty , and for loyalty .
GREY : God keep the prince from all the pack of you ! A knot you are of damned blood-suckers !
VAUGHAN : You live that shall cry woe for this after .
RATCLIFF : Dispatch ; the limit of your lives is out .
RIVERS : O Pomfret , Pomfret ! O thou bloody prison , Fatal and ominous to noble peers ! Within the guilty closure of thy walls Richard the second here was hack 'd to death ; And , for more slander to thy dismal seat , We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink .
GREY : Now Margaret 's curse is fall 'n upon our heads , For standing by when Richard stabb 'd her son .
RIVERS : Then cursed she Hastings , then cursed she Buckingham , Then cursed she Richard . O , remember , God To hear her prayers for them , as now for us And for my sister and her princely sons , Be satisfied , dear God , with our true blood , Which , as thou know 'st , unjustly must be spilt .

BUCKINGHAM : Are all things fitting for that royal time ?
DERBY : It is , and wants but nomination .
BISHOP OF ELY : To-morrow , then , I judge a happy day .
BUCKINGHAM : Who knows the lord protector 's mind herein ? Who is most inward with the royal duke ?
BISHOP OF ELY : Your grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
BUCKINGHAM : Who , I , my lord I we know each other 's faces , But for our hearts , he knows no more of mine , Than I of yours ; Nor I no more of his , than you of mine . Lord Hastings , you and he are near in love .
HASTINGS : I thank his grace , I know he loves me well ; But , for his purpose in the coronation . I have not sounded him , nor he deliver 'd His gracious pleasure any way therein : But you , my noble lords , may name the time ; And in the duke 's behalf I 'll give my voice , Which , I presume , he 'll take in gentle part .

BISHOP OF ELY : Now in good time , here comes the duke himself .
