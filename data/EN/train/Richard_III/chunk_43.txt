RICHMOND : The weary sun hath made a golden set , And by the bright track of his fiery car , Gives signal , of a goodly day to-morrow . Sir William Brandon , you shall bear my standard . Give me some ink and paper in my tent I 'll draw the form and model of our battle , Limit each leader to his several charge , And part in just proportion our small strength . My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , And you , Sir Walter Herbert , stay with me . The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment : Good Captain Blunt , bear my good night to him And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent : Yet one thing more , good Blunt , before thou go 'st , Where is Lord Stanley quarter 'd , dost thou know ?
BLUNT : Unless I have mista 'en his colours much , Which well I am assured I have not done , His regiment lies half a mile at least South from the mighty power of the king .
RICHMOND : If without peril it be possible , Good Captain Blunt , bear my good-night to him , And give him from me this most needful scroll .
BLUNT : Upon my life , my lord , I 'll under-take it ; And so , God give you quiet rest to-night !
RICHMOND : Good night , good Captain Blunt . Come gentlemen , Let us consult upon to-morrow 's business In to our tent ; the air is raw and cold . They withdraw into the tent Enter , to his tent , KING RICHARD III , NORFOLK , RATCLIFF , CATESBY , and others
KING RICHARD III : What is 't o 'clock ?
CATESBY : It 's supper-time , my lord ; It 's nine o 'clock .
KING RICHARD III : I will not sup to-night . Give me some ink and paper . What , is my beaver easier than it was ? And all my armour laid into my tent ?
CATESBY : If is , my liege ; and all things are in readiness .
KING RICHARD III : Good Norfolk , hie thee to thy charge ; Use careful watch , choose trusty sentinels .

Exit CATESBY Fill me a bowl of wine . Give me a watch . Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow . Look that my staves be sound , and not too heavy . Ratcliff !
RATCLIFF : My lord ?
KING RICHARD III : Saw 'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland ?
RATCLIFF : Thomas the Earl of Surrey , and himself , Much about cock-shut time , from troop to troop Went through the army , cheering up the soldiers .
KING RICHARD III : So , I am satisfied . Give me a bowl of wine : I have not that alacrity of spirit , Nor cheer of mind , that I was wont to have . Set it down . Is ink and paper ready ?
RATCLIFF : It is , my lord .
KING RICHARD III : Bid my guard watch ; leave me . Ratcliff , about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me . Leave me , I say . Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent , Lords and others attending
