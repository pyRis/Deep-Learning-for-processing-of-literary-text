YORK : Now , by my troth , if I had been remember 'd , I could have given my uncle 's grace a flout , To touch his growth nearer than he touch 'd mine .
DUCHESS OF YORK : How , my pretty York ? I pray thee , let me hear it .
YORK : Marry , they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old ' Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth . Grandam , this would have been a biting jest .
DUCHESS OF YORK : I pray thee , pretty York , who told thee this ?
YORK : Grandam , his nurse .
DUCHESS OF YORK : His nurse ! why , she was dead ere thou wert born .
YORK : If ' twere not she , I cannot tell who told me .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : A parlous boy : go to , you are too shrewd .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Good madam , be not angry with the child .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Pitchers have ears . Enter a Messenger
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : Here comes a messenger . What news ?
Messenger : Such news , my lord , as grieves me to unfold .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : How fares the prince ?
Messenger : Well , madam , and in health .
DUCHESS OF YORK : What is thy news then ?
Messenger : Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret , With them Sir Thomas Vaughan , prisoners .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Who hath committed them ?
Messenger : The mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : For what offence ?
Messenger : The sum of all I can , I have disclosed ; Why or for what these nobles were committed Is all unknown to me , my gracious lady .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Ay me , I see the downfall of our house ! The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind ; Insulting tyranny begins to jet Upon the innocent and aweless throne : Welcome , destruction , death , and massacre ! I see , as in a map , the end of all .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Accursed and unquiet wrangling days , How many of you have mine eyes beheld ! My husband lost his life to get the crown ; And often up and down my sons were toss 'd , For me to joy and weep their gain and loss : And being seated , and domestic broils Clean over-blown , themselves , the conquerors . Make war upon themselves ; blood against blood , Self against self : O , preposterous And frantic outrage , end thy damned spleen ; Or let me die , to look on death no more !
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Come , come , my boy ; we will to sanctuary . Madam , farewell .
DUCHESS OF YORK : I 'll go along with you .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : You have no cause .
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK : My gracious lady , go ; And thither bear your treasure and your goods . For my part , I 'll resign unto your grace The seal I keep : and so betide to me As well I tender you and all of yours ! Come , I 'll conduct you to the sanctuary . The trumpets sound . Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD , GLOUCESTER , BUCKINGHAM , CARDINAL , CATESBY , and others
BUCKINGHAM : Welcome , sweet prince , to London , to your chamber .
GLOUCESTER : Welcome , dear cousin , my thoughts ' sovereign The weary way hath made you melancholy .
PRINCE EDWARD : No , uncle ; but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy I want more uncles here to welcome me .
GLOUCESTER : Sweet prince , the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet dived into the world 's deceit Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show ; which , God he knows , Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart . Those uncles which you want were dangerous ; Your grace attended to their sugar 'd words , But look 'd not on the poison of their hearts : God keep you from them , and from such false friends !
PRINCE EDWARD : God keep me from false friends ! but they were none .
