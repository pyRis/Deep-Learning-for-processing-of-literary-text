Messenger : My lord , he doth deny to come .
KING RICHARD III : Off with his son George 's head !
NORFOLK : My lord , the enemy is past the marsh After the battle let George Stanley die .
KING RICHARD III : A thousand hearts are great within my bosom : Advance our standards , set upon our foes Our ancient word of courage , fair Saint George , Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons ! Upon them ! victory sits on our helms . Alarum : excursions . Enter NORFOLK and forces fighting ; to him CATESBY
CATESBY : Rescue , my Lord of Norfolk , rescue , rescue ! The king enacts more wonders than a man , Daring an opposite to every danger : His horse is slain , and all on foot he fights , Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death . Rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost ! Alarums . Enter KING RICHARD III
KING RICHARD III : A horse ! a horse ! my kingdom for a horse !
CATESBY : Withdraw , my lord ; I 'll help you to a horse .
KING RICHARD III : Slave , I have set my life upon a cast , And I will stand the hazard of the die : I think there be six Richmonds in the field ; Five have I slain to-day instead of him . A horse ! a horse ! my kingdom for a horse ! Alarum . Enter KING RICHARD III and RICHMOND ; they fight . KING RICHARD III is slain . Retreat and flourish . Re-enter RICHMOND , DERBY bearing the crown , with divers other Lords
RICHMOND : God and your arms be praised , victorious friends , The day is ours , the bloody dog is dead .
DERBY : Courageous Richmond , well hast thou acquit thee . Lo , here , this long-usurped royalty From the dead temples of this bloody wretch Have I pluck 'd off , to grace thy brows withal : Wear it , enjoy it , and make much of it .
RICHMOND : Great God of heaven , say Amen to all ! But , tell me , is young George Stanley living ?
DERBY : He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester town ; Whither , if it please you , we may now withdraw us .
RICHMOND : What men of name are slain on either side ?
DERBY : John Duke of Norfolk , Walter Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
