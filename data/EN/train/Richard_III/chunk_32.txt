DUCHESS OF YORK : Go thou to Richmond , and good fortune guide thee ! To LADY ANNE Go thou to Richard , and good angels guard thee ! To QUEEN ELIZABETH Go thou to sanctuary , and good thoughts possess thee ! I to my grave , where peace and rest lie with me ! Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen , And each hour 's joy wrecked with a week of teen .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Stay , yet look back with me unto the Tower . Pity , you ancient stones , those tender babes Whom envy hath immured within your walls ! Rough cradle for such little pretty ones ! Rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow For tender princes , use my babies well ! So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell . Sennet . Enter KING RICHARD III , in pomp , crowned ; BUCKINGHAM , CATESBY , a page , and others
KING RICHARD III : Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham !
BUCKINGHAM : My gracious sovereign ?
KING RICHARD III : Give me thy hand . Here he ascendeth his throne Thus high , by thy advice And thy assistance , is King Richard seated ; But shall we wear these honours for a day ? Or shall they last , and we rejoice in them ?
BUCKINGHAM : Still live they and for ever may they last !
KING RICHARD III : O Buckingham , now do I play the touch , To try if thou be current gold indeed Young Edward lives : think now what I would say .
BUCKINGHAM : Say on , my loving lord .
KING RICHARD III : Why , Buckingham , I say , I would be king ,
BUCKINGHAM : Why , so you are , my thrice renowned liege .
KING RICHARD III : Ha ! am I king ? ' tis so : but Edward lives .
BUCKINGHAM : True , noble prince .
KING RICHARD III : O bitter consequence , That Edward still should live ! ' True , noble prince ! ' Cousin , thou wert not wont to be so dull : Shall I be plain ? I wish the bastards dead ; And I would have it suddenly perform 'd . What sayest thou ? speak suddenly ; be brief .
BUCKINGHAM : Your grace may do your pleasure .
KING RICHARD III : Tut , tut , thou art all ice , thy kindness freezeth : Say , have I thy consent that they shall die ?
BUCKINGHAM : Give me some breath , some little pause , my lord Before I positively herein : I will resolve your grace immediately . Exit
CATESBY : The king is angry : see , he bites the lip .
KING RICHARD III : I will converse with iron-witted fools And unrespective boys : none are for me That look into me with considerate eyes : High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect . Boy !
Page : My lord ?
KING RICHARD III : Know 'st thou not any whom corrupting gold Would tempt unto a close exploit of death ?
Page : My lord , I know a discontented gentleman , Whose humble means match not his haughty mind : Gold were as good as twenty orators , And will , no doubt , tempt him to any thing .
KING RICHARD III : What is his name ?
Page : His name , my lord , is Tyrrel .
KING RICHARD III : I partly know the man : go , call him hither . Exit Page The deep-revolving witty Buckingham No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel : Hath he so long held out with me untired , And stops he now for breath ? Enter STANLEY How now ! what news with you ?
STANLEY : My lord , I hear the Marquis Dorset 's fled To Richmond , in those parts beyond the sea Where he abides . Stands apart
KING RICHARD III : Catesby !
CATESBY : My lord ?
