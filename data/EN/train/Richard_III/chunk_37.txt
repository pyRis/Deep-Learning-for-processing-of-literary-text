QUEEN ELIZABETH : Though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me ; I say amen to all .
KING RICHARD III : Stay , madam ; I must speak a word with you .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to murder : for my daughters , Richard , They shall be praying nuns , not weeping queens ; And therefore level not to hit their lives .
KING RICHARD III : You have a daughter call 'd Elizabeth , Virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : And must she die for this ? O , let her live , And I 'll corrupt her manners , stain her beauty ; Slander myself as false to Edward 's bed ; Throw over her the veil of infamy : So she may live unscarr 'd of bleeding slaughter , I will confess she was not Edward 's daughter .
KING RICHARD III : Wrong not her birth , she is of royal blood .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : To save her life , I 'll say she is not so .
KING RICHARD III : Her life is only safest in her birth .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : And only in that safety died her brothers .
KING RICHARD III : Lo , at their births good stars were opposite .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : No , to their lives bad friends were contrary .
KING RICHARD III : All unavoided is the doom of destiny .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : True , when avoided grace makes destiny : My babes were destined to a fairer death , If grace had bless 'd thee with a fairer life .
KING RICHARD III : You speak as if that I had slain my cousins .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Cousins , indeed ; and by their uncle cozen 'd Of comfort , kingdom , kindred , freedom , life . Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts , Thy head , all indirectly , gave direction : No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart , To revel in the entrails of my lambs . But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchor 'd in thine eyes ; And I , in such a desperate bay of death , Like a poor bark , of sails and tackling reft , Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom .
KING RICHARD III : Madam , so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars , As I intend more good to you and yours , Than ever you or yours were by me wrong 'd !
QUEEN ELIZABETH : What good is cover 'd with the face of heaven , To be discover 'd , that can do me good ?
KING RICHARD III : The advancement of your children , gentle lady .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads ?
KING RICHARD III : No , to the dignity and height of honour The high imperial type of this earth 's glory .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Flatter my sorrows with report of it ; Tell me what state , what dignity , what honour , Canst thou demise to any child of mine ?
KING RICHARD III : Even all I have ; yea , and myself and all , Will I withal endow a child of thine ; So in the Lethe of thy angry soul Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs Which thou supposest I have done to thee .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Be brief , lest that be process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
KING RICHARD III : Then know , that from my soul I love thy daughter .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : My daughter 's mother thinks it with her soul .
KING RICHARD III : What do you think ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul : So from thy soul 's love didst thou love her brothers ; And from my heart 's love I do thank thee for it .
KING RICHARD III : Be not so hasty to confound my meaning : I mean , that with my soul I love thy daughter , And mean to make her queen of England .
