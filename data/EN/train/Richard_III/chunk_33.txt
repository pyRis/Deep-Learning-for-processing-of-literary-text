TYRREL : James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
KING RICHARD III : Art thou , indeed ?
TYRREL : Prove me , my gracious sovereign .
KING RICHARD III : Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine ?
TYRREL : Ay , my lord ; But I had rather kill two enemies .
KING RICHARD III : Why , there thou hast it : two deep enemies , Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep 's disturbers Are they that I would have thee deal upon : Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
TYRREL : Let me have open means to come to them , And soon I 'll rid you from the fear of them .
KING RICHARD III : Thou sing 'st sweet music . Hark , come hither , Tyrrel Go , by this token : rise , and lend thine ear : Whispers There is no more but so : say it is done , And I will love thee , and prefer thee too .
TYRREL : ' Tis done , my gracious lord .
KING RICHARD III : Shall we hear from thee , Tyrrel , ere we sleep ?
TYRREL : Ye shall , my Lord . Exit Re-enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM : My Lord , I have consider 'd in my mind The late demand that you did sound me in .
KING RICHARD III : Well , let that pass . Dorset is fled to Richmond .
BUCKINGHAM : I hear that news , my lord .
KING RICHARD III : Stanley , he is your wife 's son well , look to it .
BUCKINGHAM : My lord , I claim your gift , my due by promise , For which your honour and your faith is pawn 'd ; The earldom of Hereford and the moveables The which you promised I should possess .
KING RICHARD III : Stanley , look to your wife ; if she convey Letters to Richmond , you shall answer it .
BUCKINGHAM : What says your highness to my just demand ?
KING RICHARD III : As I remember , Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king , When Richmond was a little peevish boy . A king , perhaps , perhaps , --
BUCKINGHAM : My lord !
KING RICHARD III : How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me , I being by , that I should kill him ?
BUCKINGHAM : My lord , your promise for the earldom , --
KING RICHARD III : Richmond ! When last I was at Exeter , The mayor in courtesy show 'd me the castle , And call 'd it Rougemont : at which name I started , Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond .
BUCKINGHAM : My Lord !
KING RICHARD III : Ay , what 's o 'clock ?
BUCKINGHAM : I am thus bold to put your grace in mind Of what you promised me .
KING RICHARD III : Well , but what 's o 'clock ?
BUCKINGHAM : Upon the stroke of ten .
KING RICHARD III : Well , let it strike .
BUCKINGHAM : Why let it strike ?
KING RICHARD III : Because that , like a Jack , thou keep 'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation . I am not in the giving vein to-day .
BUCKINGHAM : Why , then resolve me whether you will or no .
KING RICHARD III : Tut , tut , Thou troublest me ; am not in the vein .
BUCKINGHAM : Is it even so ? rewards he my true service With such deep contempt made I him king for this ? O , let me think on Hastings , and be gone To Brecknock , while my fearful head is on ! Exit Enter TYRREL
