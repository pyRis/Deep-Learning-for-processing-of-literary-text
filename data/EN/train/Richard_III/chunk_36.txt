QUEEN MARGARET : Forbear to sleep the nights , and fast the days ; Compare dead happiness with living woe ; Think that thy babes were fairer than they were , And he that slew them fouler than he is : Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse : Revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : My words are dull ; O , quicken them with thine !
QUEEN MARGARET : Thy woes will make them sharp , and pierce like mine . Exit
DUCHESS OF YORK : Why should calamity be full of words ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Windy attorneys to their client woes , Airy succeeders of intestate joys , Poor breathing orators of miseries ! Let them have scope : though what they do impart Help not all , yet do they ease the heart .
DUCHESS OF YORK : If so , then be not tongue-tied : go with me . And in the breath of bitter words let 's smother My damned son , which thy two sweet sons smother 'd . I hear his drum : be copious in exclaims . Enter KING RICHARD III , marching , with drums and trumpets
KING RICHARD III : Who intercepts my expedition ?
DUCHESS OF YORK : O , she that might have intercepted thee , By strangling thee in her accursed womb From all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done !
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown , Where should be graven , if that right were right , The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown , And the dire death of my two sons and brothers ? Tell me , thou villain slave , where are my children ?
DUCHESS OF YORK : Thou toad , thou toad , where is thy brother Clarence ? And little Ned Plantagenet , his son ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Where is kind Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
KING RICHARD III : A flourish , trumpets ! strike alarum , drums ! Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women Rail on the Lord 's enointed : strike , I say ! Flourish . Alarums Either be patient , and entreat me fair , Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Art thou my son ?
KING RICHARD III : Ay , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Then patiently hear my impatience .
KING RICHARD III : Madam , I have a touch of your condition , Which cannot brook the accent of reproof .
DUCHESS OF YORK : O , let me speak !
KING RICHARD III : Do then : but I 'll not hear .
DUCHESS OF YORK : I will be mild and gentle in my speech .
KING RICHARD III : And brief , good mother ; for I am in haste .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Art thou so hasty ? I have stay 'd for thee , God knows , in anguish , pain and agony .
KING RICHARD III : And came I not at last to comfort you ?
DUCHESS OF YORK : No , by the holy rood , thou know 'st it well , Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell . A grievous burthen was thy birth to me ; Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy ; Thy school-days frightful , desperate , wild , and furious , Thy prime of manhood daring , bold , and venturous , Thy age confirm 'd , proud , subdued , bloody , treacherous , More mild , but yet more harmful , kind in hatred : What comfortable hour canst thou name , That ever graced me in thy company ?
KING RICHARD III : Faith , none , but Humphrey Hour , that call 'd your grace To breakfast once forth of my company . If I be so disgracious in your sight , Let me march on , and not offend your grace . Strike the drum .
DUCHESS OF YORK : I prithee , hear me speak .
KING RICHARD III : You speak too bitterly .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Hear me a word ; For I shall never speak to thee again .
KING RICHARD III : So .
