GLOUCESTER : Short summers lightly have a forward spring . Enter young YORK , HASTINGS , and the CARDINAL
BUCKINGHAM : Now , in good time , here comes the Duke of York .
PRINCE EDWARD : Richard of York ! how fares our loving brother ?
YORK : Well , my dread lord ; so must I call you now .
PRINCE EDWARD : Ay , brother , to our grief , as it is yours : Too late he died that might have kept that title , Which by his death hath lost much majesty .
GLOUCESTER : How fares our cousin , noble Lord of York ?
YORK : I thank you , gentle uncle . O , my lord , You said that idle weeds are fast in growth The prince my brother hath outgrown me far .
GLOUCESTER : He hath , my lord .
YORK : And therefore is he idle ?
GLOUCESTER : O , my fair cousin , I must not say so .
YORK : Then is he more beholding to you than I.
GLOUCESTER : He may command me as my sovereign ; But you have power in me as in a kinsman .
YORK : I pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
GLOUCESTER : My dagger , little cousin ? with all my heart .
PRINCE EDWARD : A beggar , brother ?
YORK : Of my kind uncle , that I know will give ; And being but a toy , which is no grief to give .
GLOUCESTER : A greater gift than that I 'll give my cousin .
YORK : A greater gift ! O , that 's the sword to it .
GLOUCESTER : A gentle cousin , were it light enough .
YORK : O , then , I see , you will part but with light gifts ; In weightier things you 'll say a beggar nay .
GLOUCESTER : It is too heavy for your grace to wear .
YORK : I weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
GLOUCESTER : What , would you have my weapon , little lord ?
YORK : I would , that I might thank you as you call me .
GLOUCESTER : How ?
YORK : Little .
PRINCE EDWARD : My Lord of York will still be cross in talk : Uncle , your grace knows how to bear with him .
YORK : You mean , to bear me , not to bear with me : Uncle , my brother mocks both you and me ; Because that I am little , like an ape , He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders .
BUCKINGHAM : With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons ! To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle , He prettily and aptly taunts himself : So cunning and so young is wonderful .
GLOUCESTER : My lord , will 't please you pass along ? Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother , to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you .
YORK : What , will you go unto the Tower , my lord ?
PRINCE EDWARD : My lord protector needs will have it so .
YORK : I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower .
GLOUCESTER : Why , what should you fear ?
YORK : Marry , my uncle Clarence ' angry ghost : My grandam told me he was murdered there .
PRINCE EDWARD : I fear no uncles dead .
GLOUCESTER : Nor none that live , I hope .
PRINCE EDWARD : An if they live , I hope I need not fear . But come , my lord ; and with a heavy heart , Thinking on them , go I unto the Tower .
BUCKINGHAM : Think you , my lord , this little prating York Was not incensed by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously ?
GLOUCESTER : No doubt , no doubt ; O , ' tis a parlous boy ; Bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable He is all the mother 's , from the top to toe .
