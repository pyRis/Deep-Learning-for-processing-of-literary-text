Lord Mayor : Do , good my lord , your citizens entreat you .
BUCKINGHAM : Refuse not , mighty lord , this proffer 'd love .
CATESBY : O , make them joyful , grant their lawful suit !
GLOUCESTER : Alas , why would you heap these cares on me ? I am unfit for state and majesty ; I do beseech you , take it not amiss ; I cannot nor I will not yield to you .
BUCKINGHAM : If you refuse it , --as , in love and zeal , Loath to depose the child , Your brother 's son ; As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle , kind , effeminate remorse , Which we have noted in you to your kin , And egally indeed to all estates , -- Yet whether you accept our suit or no , Your brother 's son shall never reign our king ; But we will plant some other in the throne , To the disgrace and downfall of your house : And in this resolution here we leave you.-- Come , citizens : ' zounds ! I 'll entreat no more .
GLOUCESTER : O , do not swear , my lord of Buckingham . Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens
CATESBY : Call them again , my lord , and accept their suit .
ANOTHER : Do , good my lord , lest all the land do rue it .
GLOUCESTER : Would you enforce me to a world of care ? Well , call them again . I am not made of stone , But penetrable to your. kind entreats , Albeit against my conscience and my soul . Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest Cousin of Buckingham , and you sage , grave men , Since you will buckle fortune on my back , To bear her burthen , whether I will or no , I must have patience to endure the load : But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach Attend the sequel of your imposition , Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and stains thereof ; For God he knows , and you may partly see , How far I am from the desire thereof .
Lord Mayor : God bless your grace ! we see it , and will say it .
GLOUCESTER : In saying so , you shall but say the truth .
BUCKINGHAM : Then I salute you with this kingly title : Long live Richard , England 's royal king !
Lord Mayor Citizens : Amen .
BUCKINGHAM : To-morrow will it please you to be crown 'd ?
GLOUCESTER : Even when you please , since you will have it so .
BUCKINGHAM : To-morrow , then , we will attend your grace : And so most joyfully we take our leave .
GLOUCESTER : Come , let us to our holy task again . Farewell , good cousin ; farewell , gentle friends . Enter , on one side , QUEEN ELIZABETH , DUCHESS OF YORK , and DORSET ; on the other , ANNE , Duchess of Gloucester , leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet , CLARENCE 's young Daughter
DUCHESS OF YORK : Who m eets us here ? my niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester ? Now , for my life , she 's wandering to the Tower , On pure heart 's love to greet the tender princes . Daughter , well met .
LADY ANNE : God give your graces both A happy and a joyful time of day !
QUEEN ELIZABETH : As much to you , good sister ! Whither away ?
LADY ANNE : No farther than the Tower ; and , as I guess , Upon the like devotion as yourselves , To gratulate the gentle princes there .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Kind sister , thanks : we 'll enter all together . Enter BRAKENBURY And , in good time , here the lieutenant comes . Master lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , How doth the prince , and my young son of York ?
BRAKENBURY : Right well , dear madam . By your patience , I may not suffer you to visit them ; The king hath straitly charged the contrary .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : The king ! why , who 's that ?
BRAKENBURY : I cry you mercy : I mean the lord protector .
