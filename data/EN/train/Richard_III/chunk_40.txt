QUEEN ELIZABETH : Shall I be tempted of the devil thus ?
KING RICHARD III : Ay , if the devil tempt thee to do good .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Shall I forget myself to be myself ?
KING RICHARD III : Ay , if yourself 's remembrance wrong yourself .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : But thou didst kill my children .
KING RICHARD III : But in your daughter 's womb I bury them : Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed Selves of themselves , to your recomforture .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Shall I go win my daughter to thy will ?
KING RICHARD III : And be a happy mother by the deed .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : I go . Write to me very shortly . And you shall understand from me her mind .
KING RICHARD III : Bear her my true love 's kiss ; and so , farewell . Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH Relenting fool , and shallow , changing woman ! Enter RATCLIFF ; CATESBY following How now ! what news ?
RATCLIFF : My gracious sovereign , on the western coast Rideth a puissant navy ; to the shore Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends , Unarm 'd , and unresolved to beat them back : ' Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral ; And there they hull , expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore .
KING RICHARD III : Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk : Ratcliff , thyself , or Catesby ; where is he ?
CATESBY : Here , my lord .
KING RICHARD III : Fly to the duke : To RATCLIFF Post thou to Salisbury When thou comest thither-- To CATESBY Dull , unmindful villain , Why stand 'st thou still , and go 'st not to the duke ?
CATESBY : First , mighty sovereign , let me know your mind , What from your grace I shall deliver to him .
KING RICHARD III : O , true , good Catesby : bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power he can make , And meet me presently at Salisbury .
CATESBY : I go . Exit
RATCLIFF : What is 't your highness ' pleasure I shall do at Salisbury ?
KING RICHARD III : Why , what wouldst thou do there before I go ?
RATCLIFF : Your highness told me I should post before .
KING RICHARD III : My mind is changed , sir , my mind is changed . Enter STANLEY How now , what news with you ?
STANLEY : None good , my lord , to please you with the hearing ; Nor none so bad , but it may well be told .
KING RICHARD III : Hoyday , a riddle ! neither good nor bad ! Why dost thou run so many mile about , When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way ? Once more , what news ?
STANLEY : Richmond is on the seas .
KING RICHARD III : There let him sink , and be the seas on him ! White-liver 'd runagate , what doth he there ?
STANLEY : I know not , mighty sovereign , but by guess .
KING RICHARD III : Well , sir , as you guess , as you guess ?
STANLEY : Stirr 'd up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Ely , He makes for England , there to claim the crown .
KING RICHARD III : Is the chair empty ? is the sword unsway 'd ? Is the king dead ? the empire unpossess 'd ? What heir of York is there alive but we ? And who is England 's king but great York 's heir ? Then , tell me , what doth he upon the sea ?
STANLEY : Unless for that , my liege , I cannot guess .
KING RICHARD III : Unless for that he comes to be your liege , You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes . Thou wilt revolt , and fly to him , I fear .
STANLEY : No , mighty liege ; therefore mistrust me not .
KING RICHARD III : Where is thy power , then , to beat him back ? Where are thy tenants and thy followers ? Are they not now upon the western shore . Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships !
STANLEY : No , my good lord , my friends are in the north .
