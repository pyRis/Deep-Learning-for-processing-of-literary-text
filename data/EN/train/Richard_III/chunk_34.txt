KING RICHARD III : Kind Tyrrel , am I happy in thy news ?
TYRREL : If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness , be happy then , For it is done , my lord .
KING RICHARD III : But didst thou see them dead ?
TYRREL : I did , my lord .
KING RICHARD III : And buried , gentle Tyrrel ?
TYRREL : The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them ; But how or in what place I do not know .
KING RICHARD III : Come to me , Tyrrel , soon at after supper , And thou shalt tell the process of their death . Meantime , but think how I may do thee good , And be inheritor of thy desire . Farewell till soon . Exit TYRREL The son of Clarence have I pent up close ; His daughter meanly have I match 'd in marriage ; The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham 's bosom , And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night . Now , for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth , my brother 's daughter , And , by that knot , looks proudly o 'er the crown , To her I go , a jolly thriving wooer . Enter CATESBY
CATESBY : My lord !
KING RICHARD III : Good news or bad , that thou comest in so bluntly ?
CATESBY : Bad news , my lord : Ely is fled to Richmond ; And Buckingham , back 'd with the hardy Welshmen , Is in the field , and still his power increaseth .
KING RICHARD III : Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army . Come , I have heard that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay ; Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary Then fiery expedition be my wing , Jove 's Mercury , and herald for a king ! Come , muster men : my counsel is my shield ; We must be brief when traitors brave the field . Enter QUEEN MARGARET
QUEEN MARGARET : So , now prosperity begins to mellow And drop into the rotten mouth of death . Here in these confines slily have I lurk 'd , To watch the waning of mine adversaries . A dire induction am I witness to , And will to France , hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter , black , and tragical . Withdraw thee , wretched Margaret : who comes here ? Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Ah , my young princes ! ah , my tender babes ! My unblown flowers , new-appearing sweets ! If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fix 'd in doom perpetual , Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother 's lamentation !
QUEEN MARGARET : Hover about her ; say , that right for right Hath dimm 'd your infant morn to aged night .
DUCHESS OF YORK : So many miseries have crazed my voice , That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb , Edward Plantagenet , why art thou dead ?
QUEEN MARGARET : Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet . Edward for Edward pays a dying debt .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Wilt thou , O God , fly from such gentle lambs , And throw them in the entrails of the wolf ? When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ?
QUEEN MARGARET : When holy Harry died , and my sweet son .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Blind sight , dead life , poor mortal living ghost , Woe 's scene , world 's shame , grave 's due by life usurp 'd , Brief abstract and record of tedious days , Rest thy unrest on England 's lawful earth , Sitting down Unlawfully made drunk with innocents ' blood !
QUEEN ELIZABETH : O , that thou wouldst as well afford a grave As thou canst yield a melancholy seat ! Then would I hide my bones , not rest them here . O , who hath any cause to mourn but I ? Sitting down by her
