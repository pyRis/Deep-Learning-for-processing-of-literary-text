LADY ANNE : Vouchsafe , defused infection of a man , For these known evils , but to give me leave , By circumstance , to curse thy cursed self .
GLOUCESTER : Fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself .
LADY ANNE : Fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make No excuse current , but to hang thyself .
GLOUCESTER : By such despair , I should accuse myself .
LADY ANNE : And , by despairing , shouldst thou stand excused ; For doing worthy vengeance on thyself , Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others .
GLOUCESTER : Say that I slew them not ?
LADY ANNE : Why , then they are not dead : But dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee .
GLOUCESTER : I did not kill your husband .
LADY ANNE : Why , then he is alive .
GLOUCESTER : Nay , he is dead ; and slain by Edward 's hand .
LADY ANNE : In thy foul throat thou liest : Queen Margaret saw Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood ; The which thou once didst bend against her breast , But that thy brothers beat aside the point .
GLOUCESTER : I was provoked by her slanderous tongue , which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .
LADY ANNE : Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind . Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries : Didst thou not kill this king ?
GLOUCESTER : I grant ye .
LADY ANNE : Dost grant me , hedgehog ? then , God grant me too Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed ! O , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous !
GLOUCESTER : The fitter for the King of heaven , that hath him .
LADY ANNE : He is in heaven , where thou shalt never come .
GLOUCESTER : Let him thank me , that holp to send him thither ; For he was fitter for that place than earth .
LADY ANNE : And thou unfit for any place but hell .
GLOUCESTER : Yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
LADY ANNE : Some dungeon .
GLOUCESTER : Your bed-chamber .
LADY ANNE : Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest !
GLOUCESTER : So will it , madam till I lie with you .
LADY ANNE : I hope so .
GLOUCESTER : I know so . But , gentle Lady Anne , To leave this keen encounter of our wits , And fall somewhat into a slower method , Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets , Henry and Edward , As blameful as the executioner ?
LADY ANNE : Thou art the cause , and most accursed effect .
GLOUCESTER : Your beauty was the cause of that effect ; Your beauty : which did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world , So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom .
LADY ANNE : If I thought that , I tell thee , homicide , These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks .
GLOUCESTER : These eyes could never endure sweet beauty 's wreck ; You should not blemish it , if I stood by : As all the world is cheered by the sun , So I by that ; it is my day , my life .
LADY ANNE : Black night o 'ershade thy day , and death thy life !
GLOUCESTER : Curse not thyself , fair creature thou art both .
LADY ANNE : I would I were , to be revenged on thee .
GLOUCESTER : It is a quarrel most unnatural , To be revenged on him that loveth you .
LADY ANNE : It is a quarrel just and reasonable , To be revenged on him that slew my husband .
GLOUCESTER : He that bereft thee , lady , of thy husband , Did it to help thee to a better husband .
LADY ANNE : His better doth not breathe upon the earth .
GLOUCESTER : He lives that loves thee better than he could .
LADY ANNE : Name him .
GLOUCESTER : Plantagenet .
LADY ANNE : Why , that was he .
GLOUCESTER : The selfsame name , but one of better nature .
LADY ANNE : Where is he ?
