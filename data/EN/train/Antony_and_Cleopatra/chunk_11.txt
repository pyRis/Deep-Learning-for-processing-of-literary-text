MECAENAS : Now Antony must leave her utterly .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Never ; he will not : Age cannot wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety : other women cloy The appetites they feed : but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies ; for vilest things Become themselves in her : that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish .
MECAENAS : If beauty , wisdom , modesty , can settle The heart of Antony , Octavia is A blessed lottery to him .
AGRIPPA : Let us go . Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Humbly , sir , I thank you . Enter MARK ANTONY , OCTAVIUS CAESAR , OCTAVIA between them , and Attendants
MARK ANTONY : The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom .
OCTAVIA : All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you .
MARK ANTONY : Good night , sir . My Octavia , Read not my blemishes in the world 's report : I have not kept my square ; but that to come Shall all be done by the rule . Good night , dear lady . Good night , sir .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Good night . Enter Soothsayer
MARK ANTONY : Now , sirrah ; you do wish yourself in Egypt ?
Soothsayer : Would I had never come from thence , nor you Thither !
MARK ANTONY : If you can , your reason ?
Soothsayer : I see it in My motion , have it not in my tongue : but yet Hie you to Egypt again .
MARK ANTONY : Say to me , Whose fortunes shall rise higher , Caesar 's or mine ?
Soothsayer : Caesar 's . Therefore , O Antony , stay not by his side : Thy demon , that 's thy spirit which keeps thee , is Noble , courageous high , unmatchable , Where Caesar 's is not ; but , near him , thy angel Becomes a fear , as being o 'erpower 'd : therefore Make space enough between you .
MARK ANTONY : Speak this no more .
Soothsayer : To none but thee ; no more , but when to thee . If thou dost play with him at any game , Thou art sure to lose ; and , of that natural luck , He beats thee ' gainst the odds : thy lustre thickens , When he shines by : I say again , thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him ; But , he away , ' tis noble .
MARK ANTONY : Get thee gone : Say to Ventidius I would speak with him : Exit Soothsayer He shall to Parthia . Be it art or hap , He hath spoken true : the very dice obey him ; And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance : if we draw lots , he speeds ; His cocks do win the battle still of mine , When it is all to nought ; and his quails ever Beat mine , inhoop 'd , at odds . I will to Egypt : And though I make this marriage for my peace , I ' the east my pleasure lies . Enter VENTIDIUS O , come , Ventidius , You must to Parthia : your commission 's ready ; Follow me , and receive 't . Enter LEPIDUS , MECAENAS , and AGRIPPA
LEPIDUS : Trouble yourselves no further : pray you , hasten Your generals after .
AGRIPPA : Sir , Mark Antony Will e 'en but kiss Octavia , and we 'll follow .
LEPIDUS : Till I shall see you in your soldier 's dress , Which will become you both , farewell .
MECAENAS : We shall , As I conceive the journey , be at the Mount Before you , Lepidus .
LEPIDUS : Your way is shorter ; My purposes do draw me much about : You 'll win two days upon me .
MECAENAS AGRIPPA : Sir , good success !
LEPIDUS : Farewell . Enter CLEOPATRA , CHARMIAN , IRAS , and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA : Give me some music ; music , moody food Of us that trade in love .
Attendants : The music , ho ! Enter MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA : Let it alone ; let 's to billiards : come , Charmian .
