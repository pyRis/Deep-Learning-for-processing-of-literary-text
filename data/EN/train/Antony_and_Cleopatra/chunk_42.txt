CHARMIAN : It is well done , and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings . Ah , soldier ! Dies Re-enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA : How goes it here ?
Second Guard : All dead .
DOLABELLA : Caesar , thy thoughts Touch their effects in this : thyself art coming To see perform 'd the dreaded act which thou So sought 'st to hinder . Within ' A way there , a way for Caesar ! ' Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching
DOLABELLA : O sir , you are too sure an augurer ; That you did fear is done .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Bravest at the last , She levell 'd at our purposes , and , being royal , Took her own way . The manner of their deaths ? I do not see them bleed .
DOLABELLA : Who was last with them ?
First Guard : A simple countryman , that brought her figs : This was his basket .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Poison 'd , then .
First Guard : O Caesar , This Charmian lived but now ; she stood and spake : I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress ; tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropp 'd .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : O noble weakness ! If they had swallow 'd poison , ' twould appear By external swelling : but she looks like sleep , As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace .
DOLABELLA : Here , on her breast , There is a vent of blood and something blown : The like is on her arm .
First Guard : This is an aspic 's trail : and these fig-leaves Have slime upon them , such as the aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile .
