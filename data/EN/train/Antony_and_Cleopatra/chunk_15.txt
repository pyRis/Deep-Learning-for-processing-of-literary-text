DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I will praise any man that will praise me ; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land .
MENAS : Nor what I have done by water .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
MENAS : And you by land .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : There I deny my land service . But give me your hand , Menas : if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
MENAS : All men 's faces are true , whatsome 'er their hands are .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : But there is never a fair woman has a true face .
MENAS : No slander ; they steal hearts .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : We came hither to fight with you .
MENAS : For my part , I am sorry it is turned to a drinking . Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : If he do , sure , he cannot weep 't back again .
MENAS : You 've said , sir . We looked not for Mark Antony here : pray you , is he married to Cleopatra ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Caesar 's sister is called Octavia .
MENAS : True , sir ; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius .
MENAS : Pray ye , sir ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : ' Tis true .
MENAS : Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : If I were bound to divine of this unity , I would not prophesy so .
MENAS : I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I think so too . But you shall find , the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity : Octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
MENAS : Who would not have his wife so ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Not he that himself is not so ; which is Mark Antony . He will to his Egyptian dish again : then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar ; and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance . Antony will use his affection where it is : he married but his occasion here .
MENAS : And thus it may be . Come , sir , will you aboard ? I have a health for you .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I shall take it , sir : we have used our throats in Egypt .
MENAS : Come , let 's away . Music plays . Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
First Servant : Here they 'll be , man . Some o ' their plants are ill-rooted already : the least wind i ' the world will blow them down .
Second Servant : Lepidus is high-coloured .
First Servant : They have made him drink alms-drink .
Second Servant : As they pinch one another by the disposition , he cries out ' No more ; ' reconciles them to his entreaty , and himself to the drink .
First Servant : But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion .
Second Servant : Why , this is to have a name in great men 's fellowship : I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave .
First Servant : To be called into a huge sphere , and not to be seen to move in 't , are the holes where eyes should be , which pitifully disaster the cheeks . A sennet sounded . Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR , MARK ANTONY , LEPIDUS , POMPEY , AGRIPPA , MECAENAS , DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS , MENAS , with other captains
