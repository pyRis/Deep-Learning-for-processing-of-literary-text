CHARMIAN : O , quietness , lady !
IRAS : She is dead too , our sovereign .
CHARMIAN : Lady !
IRAS : Madam !
CHARMIAN : O madam , madam , madam !
IRAS : Royal Egypt , Empress !
CHARMIAN : Peace , peace , Iras !
CLEOPATRA : No more , but e 'en a woman , and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares . It were for me To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods ; To tell them that this world did equal theirs Till they had stol 'n our jewel . All 's but naught ; Patience is scottish , and impatience does Become a dog that 's mad : then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death , Ere death dare come to us ? How do you , women ? What , what ! good cheer ! Why , how now , Charmian ! My noble girls ! Ah , women , women , look , Our lamp is spent , it 's out ! Good sirs , take heart : We 'll bury him ; and then , what 's brave , what 's noble , Let 's do it after the high Roman fashion , And make death proud to take us . Come , away : This case of that huge spirit now is cold : Ah , women , women ! come ; we have no friend But resolution , and the briefest end . Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR , AGRIPPA , DOLABELLA , MECAENAS , GALLUS , PROCULEIUS , and others , his council of war
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Go to him , Dolabella , bid him yield ; Being so frustrate , tell him he mocks The pauses that he makes .
DOLABELLA : Caesar , I shall . Exit Enter DERCETAS , with the sword of MARK ANTONY
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Wherefore is that ? and what art thou that darest Appear thus to us ?
DERCETAS : I am call 'd Dercetas ; Mark Antony I served , who best was worthy Best to be served : whilst he stood up and spoke , He was my master ; and I wore my life To spend upon his haters . If thou please To take me to thee , as I was to him I 'll be to Caesar ; if thou pleasest not , I yield thee up my life .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : What is 't thou say 'st ?
DERCETAS : I say , O Caesar , Antony is dead .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack : the round world Should have shook lions into civil streets , And citizens to their dens : the death of Antony Is not a single doom ; in the name lay A moiety of the world .
DERCETAS : He is dead , Caesar : Not by a public minister of justice , Nor by a hired knife ; but that self hand , Which writ his honour in the acts it did , Hath , with the courage which the heart did lend it , Splitted the heart . This is his sword ; I robb 'd his wound of it ; behold it stain 'd With his most noble blood .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Look you sad , friends ? The gods rebuke me , but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings .
AGRIPPA : And strange it is , That nature must compel us to lament Our most persisted deeds .
MECAENAS : His taints and honours Waged equal with him .
AGRIPPA : A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity : but you , gods , will give us Some faults to make us men . Caesar is touch 'd .
MECAENAS : When such a spacious mirror 's set before him , He needs must see himself .
