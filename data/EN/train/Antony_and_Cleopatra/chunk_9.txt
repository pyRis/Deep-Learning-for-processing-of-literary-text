OCTAVIUS CAESAR : You have broken The article of your oath ; which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with .
LEPIDUS : Soft , Caesar !
MARK ANTONY : No , Lepidus , let him speak : The honour is sacred which he talks on now , Supposing that I lack 'd it . But , on , Caesar ; The article of my oath .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : To lend me arms and aid when I required them ; The which you both denied .
MARK ANTONY : Neglected , rather ; And then when poison 'd hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge . As nearly as I may , I 'll play the penitent to you : but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness , nor my power Work without it . Truth is , that Fulvia , To have me out of Egypt , made wars here ; For which myself , the ignorant motive , do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case .
LEPIDUS : ' Tis noble spoken .
MECAENAS : If it might please you , to enforce no further The griefs between ye : to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you .
LEPIDUS : Worthily spoken , Mecaenas .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Or , if you borrow one another 's love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of Pompey , return it again : you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
MARK ANTONY : Thou art a soldier only : speak no more .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : That truth should be silent I had almost forgot .
MARK ANTONY : You wrong this presence ; therefore speak no more .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Go to , then ; your considerate stone .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : I do not much dislike the matter , but The manner of his speech ; for 't cannot be We shall remain in friendship , our conditions So differing in their acts . Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch , from edge to edge O ' the world I would pursue it .
AGRIPPA : Give me leave , Caesar , --
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Speak , Agrippa .
AGRIPPA : Thou hast a sister by the mother 's side , Admired Octavia : great Mark Antony Is now a widower .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Say not so , Agrippa : If Cleopatra heard you , your reproof Were well deserved of rashness .
MARK ANTONY : I am not married , Caesar : let me hear Agrippa further speak .
AGRIPPA : To hold you in perpetual amity , To make you brothers , and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot , take Antony Octavia to his wife ; whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men ; Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter . By this marriage , All little jealousies , which now seem great , And all great fears , which now import their dangers , Would then be nothing : truths would be tales , Where now half tales be truths : her love to both Would , each to other and all loves to both , Draw after her . Pardon what I have spoke ; For ' tis a studied , not a present thought , By duty ruminated .
MARK ANTONY : Will Caesar speak ?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Not till he hears how Antony is touch 'd With what is spoke already .
MARK ANTONY : What power is in Agrippa , If I would say , ' Agrippa , be it so , ' To make this good ?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : The power of Caesar , and His power unto Octavia .
MARK ANTONY : May I never To this good purpose , that so fairly shows , Dream of impediment ! Let me have thy hand : Further this act of grace : and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs !
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : There is my hand . A sister I bequeath you , whom no brother Did ever love so dearly : let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts ; and never Fly off our loves again !
