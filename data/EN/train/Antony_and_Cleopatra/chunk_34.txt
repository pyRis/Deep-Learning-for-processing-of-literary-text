EROS : The gods withhold me ! Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim , and could not ?
MARK ANTONY : Eros , Wouldst thou be window 'd in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleach 'd arms , bending down His corrigible neck , his face subdued To penetrative shame , whilst the wheel 'd seat Of fortunate Caesar , drawn before him , branded His baseness that ensued ?
EROS : I would not see 't .
MARK ANTONY : Come , then ; for with a wound I must be cured . Draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country .
EROS : O , sir , pardon me !
MARK ANTONY : When I did make thee free , sworest thou not then To do this when I bade thee ? Do it at once ; Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed . Draw , and come .
EROS : Turn from me , then , that noble countenance , Wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
MARK ANTONY : Lo thee ! Turning from him
EROS : My sword is drawn .
MARK ANTONY : Then let it do at once The thing why thou hast drawn it .
EROS : My dear master , My captain , and my emperor , let me say , Before I strike this bloody stroke , farewell .
MARK ANTONY : ' Tis said , man ; and farewell .
EROS : Farewell , great chief . Shall I strike now ?
MARK ANTONY : Now , Eros .
EROS : Why , there then : thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony 's death . Kills himself
MARK ANTONY : Thrice-nobler than myself ! Thou teachest me , O valiant Eros , what I should , and thou couldst not . My queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record : but I will be A bridegroom in my death , and run into 't As to a lover 's bed . Come , then ; and , Eros , Thy master dies thy scholar : to do thus Falling on his sword I learn 'd of thee . How ! not dead ? not dead ? The guard , ho ! O , dispatch me ! Enter DERCETAS and Guard
First Guard : What 's the noise ?
MARK ANTONY : I have done my work in , friends : O , make an end Of what I have begun .
Second Guard : The star is fall 'n .
First Guard : And time is at his period .
All : Alas , and woe !
MARK ANTONY : Let him that loves me strike me dead .
First Guard : Not I.
Second Guard : Nor I.
Third Guard : Nor any one .
DERCETAS : Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly . This sword but shown to Caesar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him . Enter DIOMEDES
DIOMEDES : Where 's Antony ?
DERCETAS : There , Diomed there .
DIOMEDES : Lives he ? Wilt thou not answer , man ? Exit DERCETAS
MARK ANTONY : Art thou there , Diomed ? Draw thy sword , and give me Sufficing strokes for death .
DIOMEDES : Most absolute lord , My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee .
MARK ANTONY : When did she send thee ?
DIOMEDES : Now , my lord .
MARK ANTONY : Where is she ?
DIOMEDES : Lock 'd in her monument . She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass : for when she saw-- Which never shall be found--you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar , and that your rage Would not be purged , she sent you word she was dead ; But , fearing since how it might work , hath sent Me to proclaim the truth ; and I am come , I dread , too late .
MARK ANTONY : Too late , good Diomed : call my guard , I prithee .
DIOMEDES : What , ho , the emperor 's guard ! The guard , what , ho ! Come , your lord calls ! Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY
