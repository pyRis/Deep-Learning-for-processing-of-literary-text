OCTAVIUS CAESAR : He calls me boy ; and chides , as he had power To beat me out of Egypt ; my messenger He hath whipp 'd with rods ; dares me to personal combat , Caesar to Antony : let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die ; meantime Laugh at his challenge .
MECAENAS : Caesar must think , When one so great begins to rage , he 's hunted Even to falling . Give him no breath , but now Make boot of his distraction : never anger Made good guard for itself .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Let our best heads Know , that to-morrow the last of many battles We mean to fight : within our files there are , Of those that served Mark Antony but late , Enough to fetch him in . See it done : And feast the army ; we have store to do 't , And they have earn 'd the waste . Poor Antony ! Enter MARK ANTONY , CLEOPATRA , DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS , CHARMIAN , IRAS , ALEXAS , with others
MARK ANTONY : He will not fight with me , Domitius .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : No .
MARK ANTONY : Why should he not ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : He thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , He is twenty men to one .
MARK ANTONY : To-morrow , soldier , By sea and land I 'll fight : or I will live , Or bathe my dying honour in the blood Shall make it live again . Woo 't thou fight well ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I 'll strike , and cry ' Take all . ' 
MARK ANTONY : Well said ; come on . Call forth my household servants : let 's to-night Be bounteous at our meal . Enter three or four Servitors Give me thy hand , Thou hast been rightly honest ; --so hast thou ; -- Thou , --and thou , --and thou : --you have served me well , And kings have been your fellows .
CLEOPATRA : What means this ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : ' Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots Out of the mind .
MARK ANTONY : And thou art honest too . I wish I could be made so many men , And all of you clapp 'd up together in An Antony , that I might do you service So good as you have done .
All : The gods forbid !
MARK ANTONY : Well , my good fellows , wait on me to-night : Scant not my cups ; and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too , And suffer 'd my command .
CLEOPATRA : What does he mean ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : To make his followers weep .
MARK ANTONY : Tend me to-night ; May be it is the period of your duty : Haply you shall not see me more ; or if , A mangled shadow : perchance to-morrow You 'll serve another master . I look on you As one that takes his leave . Mine honest friends , I turn you not away ; but , like a master Married to your good service , stay till death : Tend me to-night two hours , I ask no more , And the gods yield you for 't !
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : What mean you , sir , To give them this discomfort ? Look , they weep ; And I , an ass , am onion-eyed : for shame , Transform us not to women .
MARK ANTONY : Ho , ho , ho ! Now the witch take me , if I meant it thus ! Grace grow where those drops fall ! My hearty friends , You take me in too dolorous a sense ; For I spake to you for your comfort ; did desire you To burn this night with torches : know , my hearts , I hope well of to-morrow ; and will lead you Where rather I 'll expect victorious life Than death and honour . Let 's to supper , come , And drown consideration . Enter two Soldiers to their guard
First Soldier : Brother , good night : to-morrow is the day .
Second Soldier : It will determine one way : fare you well . Heard you of nothing strange about the streets ?
First Soldier : Nothing . What news ?
