DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Not if the small come first .
LEPIDUS : Your speech is passion : But , pray you , stir no embers up . Here comes The noble Antony . Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : And yonder , Caesar . Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR , MECAENAS , and AGRIPPA
MARK ANTONY : If we compose well here , to Parthia : Hark , Ventidius .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : I do not know , Mecaenas ; ask Agrippa .
LEPIDUS : Noble friends , That which combined us was most great , and let not A leaner action rend us . What 's amiss , May it be gently heard : when we debate Our trivial difference loud , we do commit Murder in healing wounds : then , noble partners , The rather , for I earnestly beseech , Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms , Nor curstness grow to the matter .
MARK ANTONY : ' Tis spoken well . Were we before our armies , and to fight . I should do thus . Flourish
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Welcome to Rome .
MARK ANTONY : Thank you .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Sit .
MARK ANTONY : Sit , sir .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Nay , then .
MARK ANTONY : I learn , you take things ill which are not so , Or being , concern you not .

MARK ANTONY : My being in Egypt , Caesar , What was 't to you ?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt : yet , if you there Did practise on my state , your being in Egypt Might be my question .
MARK ANTONY : How intend you , practised ?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befal me . Your wife and brother Made wars upon me ; and their contestation Was theme for you , you were the word of war .
MARK ANTONY : You do mistake your business ; my brother never Did urge me in his act : I did inquire it ; And have my learning from some true reports , That drew their swords with you . Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours ; And make the wars alike against my stomach , Having alike your cause ? Of this my letters Before did satisfy you . If you 'll patch a quarrel , As matter whole you have not to make it with , It must not be with this .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me ; but You patch 'd up your excuses .
MARK ANTONY : Not so , not so ; I know you could not lack , I am certain on 't , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause ' gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace . As for my wife , I would you had her spirit in such another : The third o ' the world is yours ; which with a snaffle You may pace easy , but not such a wife .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Would we had all such wives , that the men might go to wars with the women !
MARK ANTONY : So much uncurbable , her garboils , Caesar Made out of her impatience , which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too , I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet : for that you must But say , I could not help it .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria ; you Did pocket up my letters , and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience .
