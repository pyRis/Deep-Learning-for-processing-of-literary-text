CLEOPATRA : He is a god , and knows What is most right : mine honour was not yielded , But conquer 'd merely .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : To be sure of that , I will ask Antony . Sir , sir , thou art so leaky , That we must leave thee to thy sinking , for Thy dearest quit thee . Exit
THYREUS : Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him ? for he partly begs To be desired to give . It much would please him , That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon : but it would warm his spirits , To hear from me you had left Antony , And put yourself under his shrowd , The universal landlord .
CLEOPATRA : What 's your name ?
THYREUS : My name is Thyreus .
CLEOPATRA : Most kind messenger , Say to great Caesar this : in deputation I kiss his conquering hand : tell him , I am prompt To lay my crown at ' s feet , and there to kneel : Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt .
THYREUS : ' Tis your noblest course . Wisdom and fortune combating together , If that the former dare but what it can , No chance may shake it . Give me grace to lay My duty on your hand .
CLEOPATRA : Your Caesar 's father oft , When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in , Bestow 'd his lips on that unworthy place , As it rain 'd kisses . Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
MARK ANTONY : Favours , by Jove that thunders ! What art thou , fellow ?
THYREUS : One that but performs The bidding of the fullest man , and worthiest To have command obey 'd .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : You will be whipp 'd .
MARK ANTONY : Approach , there ! Ah , you kite ! Now , gods and devils ! Authority melts from me : of late , when I cried ' Ho ! ' Like boys unto a muss , kings would start forth , And cry ' Your will ? ' Have you no ears ? I am Antony yet . Enter Attendants Take hence this Jack , and whip him .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : ' Tis better playing with a lion 's whelp Than with an old one dying .
MARK ANTONY : Moon and stars ! Whip him . Were 't twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar , should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here , --what 's her name , Since she was Cleopatra ? Whip him , fellows , Till , like a boy , you see him cringe his face , And whine aloud for mercy : take him hence .
THYREUS : Mark Antony !
MARK ANTONY : Tug him away : being whipp 'd , Bring him again : this Jack of Caesar 's shall Bear us an errand to him . You were half blasted ere I knew you : ha ! Have I my pillow left unpress 'd in Rome , Forborne the getting of a lawful race , And by a gem of women , to be abused By one that looks on feeders ?
CLEOPATRA : Good my lord , --
MARK ANTONY : You have been a boggler ever : But when we in our viciousness grow hard-- O misery on 't ! --the wise gods seel our eyes ; In our own filth drop our clear judgments ; make us Adore our errors ; laugh at 's , while we strut To our confusion .
CLEOPATRA : O , is 't come to this ?
MARK ANTONY : I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar 's trencher ; nay , you were a fragment Of Cneius Pompey 's ; besides what hotter hours , Unregister 'd in vulgar fame , you have Luxuriously pick 'd out : for , I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is .
CLEOPATRA : Wherefore is this ?
