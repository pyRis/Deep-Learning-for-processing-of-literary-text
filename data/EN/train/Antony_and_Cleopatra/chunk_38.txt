PROCULEIUS : Cleopatra , Do not abuse my master 's bounty by The undoing of yourself : let the world see His nobleness well acted , which your death Will never let come forth .
CLEOPATRA : Where art thou , death ? Come hither , come ! come , come , and take a queen Worthy many babes and beggars !
PROCULEIUS : O , temperance , lady !
CLEOPATRA : Sir , I will eat no meat , I 'll not drink , sir ; If idle talk will once be necessary , I 'll not sleep neither : this mortal house I 'll ruin , Do Caesar what he can . Know , sir , that I Will not wait pinion 'd at your master 's court ; Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia . Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ? Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me ! rather on Nilus ' mud Lay me stark naked , and let the water-flies Blow me into abhorring ! rather make My country 's high pyramides my gibbet , And hang me up in chains !
PROCULEIUS : You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar . Enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA : Proculeius , What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows , And he hath sent for thee : for the queen , I 'll take her to my guard .
PROCULEIUS : So , Dolabella , It shall content me best : be gentle to her . To CLEOPATRA To Caesar I will speak what you shall please , If you 'll employ me to him .
CLEOPATRA : Say , I would die .
DOLABELLA : Most noble empress , you have heard of me ?
CLEOPATRA : I cannot tell .
DOLABELLA : Assuredly you know me .
CLEOPATRA : No matter , sir , what I have heard or known . You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams ; Is 't not your trick ?
DOLABELLA : I understand not , madam .
CLEOPATRA : I dream 'd there was an Emperor Antony : O , such another sleep , that I might see But such another man !
DOLABELLA : If it might please ye , --
CLEOPATRA : His face was as the heavens ; and therein stuck A sun and moon , which kept their course , and lighted The little O , the earth .
DOLABELLA : Most sovereign creature , --
CLEOPATRA : His legs bestrid the ocean : his rear 'd arm Crested the world : his voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres , and that to friends ; But when he meant to quail and shake the orb , He was as rattling thunder . For his bounty , There was no winter in 't ; an autumn ' twas That grew the more by reaping : his delights Were dolphin-like ; they show 'd his back above The element they lived in : in his livery Walk 'd crowns and crownets ; realms and islands were As plates dropp 'd from his pocket .
DOLABELLA : Cleopatra !
CLEOPATRA : Think you there was , or might be , such a man As this I dream 'd of ?
DOLABELLA : Gentle madam , no .
CLEOPATRA : You lie , up to the hearing of the gods . But , if there be , or ever were , one such , It 's past the size of dreaming : nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy ; yet , to imagine And Antony , were nature 's piece ' gainst fancy , Condemning shadows quite .
DOLABELLA : Hear me , good madam . Your loss is as yourself , great ; and you bear it As answering to the weight : would I might never O 'ertake pursued success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root .
CLEOPATRA : I thank you , sir , Know you what Caesar means to do with me ?
DOLABELLA : I am loath to tell you what I would you knew .
CLEOPATRA : Nay , pray you , sir , --
DOLABELLA : Though he be honourable , --
CLEOPATRA : He 'll lead me , then , in triumph ?
