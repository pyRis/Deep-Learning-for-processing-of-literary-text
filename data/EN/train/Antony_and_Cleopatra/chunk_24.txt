EROS : Nay , gentle madam , to him , comfort him .
IRAS : Do , most dear queen .
CHARMIAN : Do ! why : what else ?
CLEOPATRA : Let me sit down . O Juno !
MARK ANTONY : No , no , no , no , no .
EROS : See you here , sir ?
MARK ANTONY : O fie , fie , fie !
CHARMIAN : Madam !
IRAS : Madam , O good empress !
EROS : Sir , sir , --
MARK ANTONY : Yes , my lord , yes ; he at Philippi kept His sword e 'en like a dancer ; while I struck The lean and wrinkled Cassius ; and ' twas I That the mad Brutus ended : he alone Dealt on lieutenantry , and no practise had In the brave squares of war : yet now--No matter .
CLEOPATRA : Ah , stand by .
EROS : The queen , my lord , the queen .
IRAS : Go to him , madam , speak to him : He is unqualitied with very shame .
CLEOPATRA : Well then , sustain him : O !
EROS : Most noble sir , arise ; the queen approaches : Her head 's declined , and death will seize her , but Your comfort makes the rescue .
MARK ANTONY : I have offended reputation , A most unnoble swerving .
EROS : Sir , the queen .
MARK ANTONY : O , whither hast thou led me , Egypt ? See , How I convey my shame out of thine eyes By looking back what I have left behind ' Stroy 'd in dishonour .
CLEOPATRA : O my lord , my lord , Forgive my fearful sails ! I little thought You would have follow 'd .
MARK ANTONY : Egypt , thou knew 'st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings , And thou shouldst tow me after : o 'er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew 'st , and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me .
CLEOPATRA : O , my pardon !
MARK ANTONY : Now I must To the young man send humble treaties , dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness ; who With half the bulk o ' the world play 'd as I pleased , Making and marring fortunes . You did know How much you were my conqueror ; and that My sword , made weak by my affection , would Obey it on all cause .
CLEOPATRA : Pardon , pardon !
MARK ANTONY : Fall not a tear , I say ; one of them rates All that is won and lost : give me a kiss ; Even this repays me . We sent our schoolmaster ; Is he come back ? Love , I am full of lead . Some wine , within there , and our viands ! Fortune knows We scorn her most when most she offers blows . Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR , DOLABELLA , THYREUS , with others
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Let him appear that 's come from Antony . Know you him ?
DOLABELLA : Caesar , ' tis his schoolmaster : An argument that he is pluck 'd , when hither He sends so poor a pinion off his wing , Which had superfluous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by . Enter EUPHRONIUS , ambassador from MARK ANTONY
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Approach , and speak .
EUPHRONIUS : Such as I am , I come from Antony : I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf To his grand sea .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Be 't so : declare thine office .
EUPHRONIUS : Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and Requires to live in Egypt : which not granted , He lessens his requests ; and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth , A private man in Athens : this for him . Next , Cleopatra does confess thy greatness ; Submits her to thy might ; and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs , Now hazarded to thy grace .
