MENAS : Why ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : A ' bears the third part of the world , man ; see 'st not ?
MENAS : The third part , then , is drunk : would it were all , That it might go on wheels !
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Drink thou ; increase the reels .
MENAS : Come .
POMPEY : This is not yet an Alexandrian feast .
MARK ANTONY : It ripens towards it . Strike the vessels , ho ? Here is to Caesar !
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : I could well forbear 't . It 's monstrous labour , when I wash my brain , And it grows fouler .
MARK ANTONY : Be a child o ' the time .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Possess it , I 'll make answer : But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Ha , my brave emperor ! To MARK ANTONY Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals , And celebrate our drink ?
POMPEY : Let 's ha 't , good soldier .
MARK ANTONY : Come , let 's all take hands , Till that the conquering wine hath steep 'd our sense In soft and delicate Lethe .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : All take hands . Make battery to our ears with the loud music : The while I 'll place you : then the boy shall sing ; The holding every man shall bear as loud As his strong sides can volley . Music plays . DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand THE SONG . Come , thou monarch of the vine , Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne ! In thy fats our cares be drown 'd , With thy grapes our hairs be crown 'd : Cup us , till the world go round , Cup us , till the world go round !
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : What would you more ? Pompey , good night . Good brother , Let me request you off : our graver business Frowns at this levity . Gentle lords , let 's part ; You see we have burnt our cheeks : strong Enobarb Is weaker than the wine ; and mine own tongue Splits what it speaks : the wild disguise hath almost Antick 'd us all . What needs more words ? Good night . Good Antony , your hand .
POMPEY : I 'll try you on the shore .
MARK ANTONY : And shall , sir ; give 's your hand .
POMPEY : O Antony , You have my father 's house , --But , what ? we are friends . Come , down into the boat .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Take heed you fall not . Menas , I 'll not on shore .
MENAS : No , to my cabin . These drums ! these trumpets , flutes ! what ! Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell To these great fellows : sound and be hang 'd , sound out ! Sound a flourish , with drums
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Ho ! says a ' There 's my cap .
MENAS : Ho ! Noble captain , come . Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph , with SILIUS , and other Romans , Officers , and Soldiers ; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him
VENTIDIUS : Now , darting Parthia , art thou struck ; and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus ' death Make me revenger . Bear the king 's son 's body Before our army . Thy Pacorus , Orodes , Pays this for Marcus Crassus .
SILIUS : Noble Ventidius , Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm , The fugitive Parthians follow ; spur through Media , Mesopotamia , and the shelters whither The routed fly : so thy grand captain Antony Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and Put garlands on thy head .
