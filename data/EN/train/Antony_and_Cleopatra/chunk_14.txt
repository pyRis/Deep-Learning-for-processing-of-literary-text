OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Take your time .
MARK ANTONY : Thou canst not fear us , Pompey , with thy sails ; We 'll speak with thee at sea : at land , thou know 'st How much we do o 'er-count thee .
POMPEY : At land , indeed , Thou dost o 'er-count me of my father 's house : But , since the cuckoo builds not for himself , Remain in 't as thou mayst .
LEPIDUS : Be pleased to tell us-- For this is from the present--how you take The offers we have sent you .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : There 's the point .
MARK ANTONY : Which do not be entreated to , but weigh What it is worth embraced .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : And what may follow , To try a larger fortune .
POMPEY : You have made me offer Of Sicily , Sardinia ; and I must Rid all the sea of pirates ; then , to send Measures of wheat to Rome ; this ' greed upon To part with unhack 'd edges , and bear back Our targes undinted .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS : That 's our offer .
POMPEY : Know , then , I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer : but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience : though I lose The praise of it by telling , you must know , When Caesar and your brother were at blows , Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly .
MARK ANTONY : I have heard it , Pompey ; And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you .
POMPEY : Let me have your hand : I did not think , sir , to have met you here .
MARK ANTONY : The beds i ' the east are soft ; and thanks to you , That call 'd me timelier than my purpose hither ; For I have gain 'd by ' t .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Since I saw you last , There is a change upon you .
POMPEY : Well , I know not What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face ; But in my bosom shall she never come , To make my heart her vassal .
LEPIDUS : Well met here .
POMPEY : I hope so , Lepidus . Thus we are agreed : I crave our composition may be written , And seal 'd between us .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : That 's the next to do .
POMPEY : We 'll feast each other ere we part ; and let 's Draw lots who shall begin .
MARK ANTONY : That will I , Pompey .
POMPEY : No , Antony , take the lot : but , first Or last , your fine Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame . I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there .
MARK ANTONY : You have heard much .
POMPEY : I have fair meanings , sir .
MARK ANTONY : And fair words to them .
POMPEY : Then so much have I heard : And I have heard , Apollodorus carried--
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : No more of that : he did so .
POMPEY : What , I pray you ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress .
POMPEY : I know thee now : how farest thou , soldier ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Well ; And well am like to do ; for , I perceive , Four feasts are toward .
POMPEY : Let me shake thy hand ; I never hated thee : I have seen thee fight , When I have envied thy behavior .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Sir , I never loved you much ; but I ha ' praised ye , When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did .
POMPEY : Enjoy thy plainness , It nothing ill becomes thee . Aboard my galley I invite you all : Will you lead , lords ?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS : Show us the way , sir .
POMPEY : Come .
MENAS : Thy father , Pompey , would ne 'er have made this treaty.--You and I have known , sir .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : At sea , I think .
MENAS : We have , sir .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : You have done well by water .
