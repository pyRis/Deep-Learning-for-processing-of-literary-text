Soldier : You keep by land The legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
CANIDIUS : Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius , are for sea : But we keep whole by land . This speed of Caesar 's Carries beyond belief .
Soldier : While he was yet in Rome , His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies .
CANIDIUS : Who 's his lieutenant , hear you ?
Soldier : They say , one Taurus .
CANIDIUS : Well I know the man . Enter a Messenger
Messenger : The emperor calls Canidius .
CANIDIUS : With news the time 's with labour , and throes forth , Each minute , some . Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR , and TAURUS , with his army , marching
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Taurus !
TAURUS : My lord ?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Strike not by land ; keep whole : provoke not battle , Till we have done at sea . Do not exceed The prescript of this scroll : our fortune lies Upon this jump . Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
MARK ANTONY : Set we our squadrons on yond side o ' the hill , In eye of Caesar 's battle ; from which place We may the number of the ships behold , And so proceed accordingly . CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage ; and TAURUS , the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR , the other way . After their going in , is heard the noise of a sea-fight Alarum . Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Naught , naught all , naught ! I can behold no longer : The Antoniad , the Egyptian admiral , With all their sixty , fly and turn the rudder : To see 't mine eyes are blasted . Enter SCARUS
SCARUS : Gods and goddesses , All the whole synod of them !
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : What 's thy passion !
SCARUS : The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance ; we have kiss 'd away Kingdoms and provinces .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : How appears the fight ?
SCARUS : On our side like the token 'd pestilence , Where death is sure . Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt , -- Whom leprosy o 'ertake ! --i ' the midst o ' the fight , When vantage like a pair of twins appear 'd , Both as the same , or rather ours the elder , The breese upon her , like a cow in June , Hoists sails and flies .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : That I beheld : Mine eyes did sicken at the sight , and could not Endure a further view .
SCARUS : She once being loof 'd , The noble ruin of her magic , Antony , Claps on his sea-wing , and , like a doting mallard , Leaving the fight in height , flies after her : I never saw an action of such shame ; Experience , manhood , honour , ne 'er before Did violate so itself .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Alack , alack ! Enter CANIDIUS
CANIDIUS : Our fortune on the sea is out of breath , And sinks most lamentably . Had our general Been what he knew himself , it had gone well : O , he has given example for our flight , Most grossly , by his own !
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Ay , are you thereabouts ? Why , then , good night indeed .
CANIDIUS : Toward Peloponnesus are they fled .
SCARUS : ' Tis easy to 't ; and there I will attend What further comes .
CANIDIUS : To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse : six kings already Show me the way of yielding .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I 'll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony , though my reason Sits in the wind against me . Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants
MARK ANTONY : Hark ! the land bids me tread no more upon 't ; It is ashamed to bear me ! Friends , come hither : I am so lated in the world , that I Have lost my way for ever : I have a ship Laden with gold ; take that , divide it ; fly , And make your peace with Caesar .
All : Fly ! not we .
