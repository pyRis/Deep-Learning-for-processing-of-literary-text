DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Sir ?
MARK ANTONY : Fulvia is dead .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Fulvia !
MARK ANTONY : Dead .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice . When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him , it shows to man the tailors of the earth ; comforting therein , that when old robes are worn out , there are members to make new . If there were no more women but Fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented : this grief is crowned with consolation ; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat : and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
MARK ANTONY : The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : And the business you have broached here cannot be without you ; especially that of Cleopatra 's , which wholly depends on your abode .
MARK ANTONY : No more light answers . Let our officers Have notice what we purpose . I shall break The cause of our expedience to the queen , And get her leave to part . For not alone The death of Fulvia , with more urgent touches , Do strongly speak to us ; but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home : Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar , and commands The empire of the sea : our slippery people , Whose love is never link 'd to the deserver Till his deserts are past , begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son ; who , high in name and power , Higher than both in blood and life , stands up For the main soldier : whose quality , going on , The sides o ' the world may danger : much is breeding , Which , like the courser 's hair , hath yet but life , And not a serpent 's poison . Say , our pleasure , To such whose place is under us , requires Our quick remove from hence .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I shall do 't . Enter CLEOPATRA , CHARMIAN , IRAS , and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA : Where is he ?
CHARMIAN : I did not see him since .
CLEOPATRA : See where he is , who 's with him , what he does : I did not send you : if you find him sad , Say I am dancing ; if in mirth , report That I am sudden sick : quick , and return . Exit ALEXAS
CHARMIAN : Madam , methinks , if you did love him dearly , You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him .
CLEOPATRA : What should I do , I do not ?
CHARMIAN : In each thing give him way , cross him nothing .
CLEOPATRA : Thou teachest like a fool ; the way to lose him .
CHARMIAN : Tempt him not so too far ; I wish , forbear : In time we hate that which we often fear . But here comes Antony . Enter MARK ANTONY
CLEOPATRA : I am sick and sullen .
MARK ANTONY : I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , --
CLEOPATRA : Help me away , dear Charmian ; I shall fall : It cannot be thus long , the sides of nature Will not sustain it .
MARK ANTONY : Now , my dearest queen , --
CLEOPATRA : Pray you , stand further from me .
MARK ANTONY : What 's the matter ?
CLEOPATRA : I know , by that same eye , there 's some good news . What says the married woman ? You may go : Would she had never given you leave to come ! Let her not say ' tis I that keep you here : I have no power upon you ; hers you are .
MARK ANTONY : The gods best know , --
CLEOPATRA : O , never was there queen So mightily betray 'd ! yet at the first I saw the treasons planted .
MARK ANTONY : Cleopatra , --
