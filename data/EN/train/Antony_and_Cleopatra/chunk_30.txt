MARK ANTONY : Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail 'd To make me fight at land !
Soldier : Hadst thou done so , The kings that have revolted , and the soldier That has this morning left thee , would have still Follow 'd thy heels .
MARK ANTONY : Who 's gone this morning ?
Soldier : Who ! One ever near thee : call for Enobarbus , He shall not hear thee ; or from Caesar 's camp Say ' I am none of thine . ' 
MARK ANTONY : What say 'st thou ?
Soldier : Sir , He is with Caesar .
EROS : Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him .
MARK ANTONY : Is he gone ?
Soldier : Most certain .
MARK ANTONY : Go , Eros , send his treasure after ; do it ; Detain no jot , I charge thee : write to him-- I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings ; Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master . O , my fortunes have Corrupted honest men ! Dispatch.--Enobarbus ! Flourish . Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR , AGRIPPA , with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS , and others
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Go forth , Agrippa , and begin the fight : Our will is Antony be took alive ; Make it so known .
AGRIPPA : Caesar , I shall . Exit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : The time of universal peace is near : Prove this a prosperous day , the three-nook 'd world Shall bear the olive freely . Enter a Messenger
Messenger : Antony Is come into the field .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the van , That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Alexas did revolt ; and went to Jewry on Affairs of Antony ; there did persuade Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar , And leave his master Antony : for this pains Caesar hath hang 'd him . Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment , but No honourable trust . I have done ill ; Of which I do accuse myself so sorely , That I will joy no more . Enter a Soldier of CAESAR 's
Soldier : Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus : the messenger Came on my guard ; and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I give it you .
Soldier : Mock not , Enobarbus . I tell you true : best you safed the bringer Out of the host ; I must attend mine office , Or would have done 't myself . Your emperor Continues still a Jove . Exit
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : I am alone the villain of the earth , And feel I am so most . O Antony , Thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid My better service , when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold ! This blows my heart : If swift thought break it not , a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought : but thought will do 't , I feel . I fight against thee ! No : I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die ; the foul 'st best fits My latter part of life . Exit Alarum . Drums and trumpets . Enter AGRIPPA and others
AGRIPPA : Retire , we have engaged ourselves too far : Caesar himself has work , and our oppression Exceeds what we expected . Alarums . Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded
SCARUS : O my brave emperor , this is fought indeed ! Had we done so at first , we had droven them home With clouts about their heads .
MARK ANTONY : Thou bleed 'st apace .
SCARUS : I had a wound here that was like a T , But now ' tis made an H.
MARK ANTONY : They do retire .
SCARUS : We 'll beat ' em into bench-holes : I have yet Room for six scotches more . Enter EROS
EROS : They are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves For a fair victory .
SCARUS : Let us score their backs , And snatch ' em up , as we take hares , behind : ' Tis sport to maul a runner .
