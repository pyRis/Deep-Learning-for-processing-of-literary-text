Messenger : He 's married , madam .
CLEOPATRA : Rogue , thou hast lived too long . Draws a knife
Messenger : Nay , then I 'll run . What mean you , madam ? I have made no fault . Exit
CHARMIAN : Good madam , keep yourself within yourself : The man is innocent .
CLEOPATRA : Some innocents ' scape not the thunderbolt . Melt Egypt into Nile ! and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents ! Call the slave again : Though I am mad , I will not bite him : call .
CHARMIAN : He is afeard to come .
CLEOPATRA : I will not hurt him . Exit CHARMIAN These hands do lack nobility , that they strike A meaner than myself ; since I myself Have given myself the cause . Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger Come hither , sir . Though it be honest , it is never good To bring bad news : give to a gracious message . An host of tongues ; but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt .
Messenger : I have done my duty .
CLEOPATRA : Is he married ? I cannot hate thee worser than I do , If thou again say ' Yes . ' 
Messenger : He 's married , madam .
CLEOPATRA : The gods confound thee ! dost thou hold there still ?
Messenger : Should I lie , madam ?
CLEOPATRA : O , I would thou didst , So half my Egypt were submerged and made A cistern for scaled snakes ! Go , get thee hence : Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face , to me Thou wouldst appear most ugly . He is married ?
Messenger : I crave your highness ' pardon .
CLEOPATRA : He is married ?
Messenger : Take no offence that I would not offend you : To punish me for what you make me do . Seems much unequal : he 's married to Octavia .
CLEOPATRA : O , that his fault should make a knave of thee , That art not what thou 'rt sure of ! Get thee hence : The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me : lie they upon thy hand , And be undone by ' em ! Exit Messenger
CHARMIAN : Good your highness , patience .
CLEOPATRA : In praising Antony , I have dispraised Caesar .
CHARMIAN : Many times , madam .
CLEOPATRA : I am paid for 't now . Lead me from hence : I faint : O Iras , Charmian ! ' tis no matter . Go to the fellow , good Alexas ; bid him Report the feature of Octavia , her years , Her inclination , let him not leave out The colour of her hair : bring me word quickly . Exit ALEXAS Let him for ever go : --let him not--Charmian , Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon , The other way 's a Mars . Bid you Alexas To MARDIAN Bring me word how tall she is . Pity me , Charmian , But do not speak to me . Lead me to my chamber . Flourish . Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door , with drum and trumpet : at another , OCTAVIUS CAESAR , MARK ANTONY , LEPIDUS , DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS , MECAENAS , with Soldiers marching
POMPEY : Your hostages I have , so have you mine ; And we shall talk before we fight .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Most meet That first we come to words ; and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent ; Which , if thou hast consider 'd , let us know If ' twill tie up thy discontented sword , And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here .
