EUPHRONIUS : Fortune pursue thee !
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Bring him through the bands . Exit EUPHRONIUS To THYREUS From Antony win Cleopatra : promise , And in our name , what she requires ; add more , From thine invention , offers : women are not In their best fortunes strong ; but want will perjure The ne 'er touch 'd vestal : try thy cunning , Thyreus ; Make thine own edict for thy pains , which we Will answer as a law .
THYREUS : Caesar , I go .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think 'st his very action speaks In every power that moves .
THYREUS : Caesar , I shall . Enter CLEOPATRA , DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS , CHARMIAN , and IRAS
CLEOPATRA : What shall we do , Enobarbus ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Think , and die .
CLEOPATRA : Is Antony or we in fault for this ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Antony only , that would make his will Lord of his reason . What though you fled From that great face of war , whose several ranges Frighted each other ? why should he follow ? The itch of his affection should not then Have nick 'd his captainship ; at such a point , When half to half the world opposed , he being The meered question : ' twas a shame no less Than was his loss , to course your flying flags , And leave his navy gazing .
CLEOPATRA : Prithee , peace . Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS , the Ambassador
MARK ANTONY : Is that his answer ?
EUPHRONIUS : Ay , my lord .
MARK ANTONY : The queen shall then have courtesy , so she Will yield us up .
EUPHRONIUS : He says so .
MARK ANTONY : Let her know 't . To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head , And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities .
CLEOPATRA : That head , my lord ?
MARK ANTONY : To him again : tell him he wears the rose Of youth upon him ; from which the world should note Something particular : his coin , ships , legions , May be a coward 's ; whose ministers would prevail Under the service of a child as soon As i ' the command of Caesar : I dare him therefore To lay his gay comparisons apart , And answer me declined , sword against sword , Ourselves alone . I 'll write it : follow me .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Yes , like enough , high-battled Caesar will Unstate his happiness , and be staged to the show , Against a sworder ! I see men 's judgments are A parcel of their fortunes ; and things outward Do draw the inward quality after them , To suffer all alike . That he should dream , Knowing all measures , the full Caesar will Answer his emptiness ! Caesar , thou hast subdued His judgment too . Enter an Attendant
Attendant : A messenger from CAESAR .
CLEOPATRA : What , no more ceremony ? See , my women ! Against the blown rose may they stop their nose That kneel 'd unto the buds . Admit him , sir . Exit Attendant
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Mine honesty and I begin to square . The loyalty well held to fools does make Our faith mere folly : yet he that can endure To follow with allegiance a fall 'n lord Does conquer him that did his master conquer And earns a place i ' the story . Enter THYREUS
CLEOPATRA : Caesar 's will ?
THYREUS : Hear it apart .
CLEOPATRA : None but friends : say boldly .
THYREUS : So , haply , are they friends to Antony .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : He needs as many , sir , as Caesar has ; Or needs not us . If Caesar please , our master Will leap to be his friend : for us , you know , Whose he is we are , and that is , Caesar 's .
THYREUS : So . Thus then , thou most renown 'd : Caesar entreats , Not to consider in what case thou stand 'st , Further than he is Caesar .
CLEOPATRA : Go on : right royal .
THYREUS : He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you fear 'd him .
CLEOPATRA : O !
