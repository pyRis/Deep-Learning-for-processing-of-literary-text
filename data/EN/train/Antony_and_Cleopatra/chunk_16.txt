LEPIDUS : You 've strange serpents there .
MARK ANTONY : Ay , Lepidus .
LEPIDUS : Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun : so is your crocodile .
MARK ANTONY : They are so .
POMPEY : Sit , --and some wine ! A health to Lepidus !
LEPIDUS : I am not so well as I should be , but I 'll ne 'er out .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Not till you have slept ; I fear me you 'll be in till then .
LEPIDUS : Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies ' pyramises are very goodly things ; without contradiction , I have heard that .
MENAS : Pompey , a word .
POMPEY : Say in mine ear : what is 't ?
MENAS : Forsake thy seat , I do beseech thee , captain , And hear me speak a word .
POMPEY : Forbear me till anon . This wine for Lepidus !
LEPIDUS : What manner o ' thing is your crocodile ?
MARK ANTONY : It is shaped , sir , like itself ; and it is as broad as it hath breadth : it is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs : it lives by that which nourisheth it ; and the elements once out of it , it transmigrates .
LEPIDUS : What colour is it of ?
MARK ANTONY : Of it own colour too .
LEPIDUS : ' Tis a strange serpent .
MARK ANTONY : ' Tis so . And the tears of it are wet .
OCTAVIUS CAESAR : Will this description satisfy him ?
MARK ANTONY : With the health that Pompey gives him , else he is a very epicure .
POMPEY : Go hang , sir , hang ! Tell me of that ? away ! Do as I bid you . Where 's this cup I call 'd for ?
MENAS : If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me , Rise from thy stool .
POMPEY : I think thou 'rt mad . The matter ? Rises , and walks aside
MENAS : I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
POMPEY : Thou hast served me with much faith . What 's else to say ? Be jolly , lords .
MARK ANTONY : These quick-sands , Lepidus , Keep off them , for you sink .
MENAS : Wilt thou be lord of all the world ?
POMPEY : What say 'st thou ?
MENAS : Wilt thou be lord of the whole world ? That 's twice .
POMPEY : How should that be ?
MENAS : But entertain it , And , though thou think me poor , I am the man Will give thee all the world .
POMPEY : Hast thou drunk well ?
MENAS : Now , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup . Thou art , if thou darest be , the earthly Jove : Whate 'er the ocean pales , or sky inclips , Is thine , if thou wilt ha 't .
POMPEY : Show me which way .
MENAS : These three world-sharers , these competitors , Are in thy vessel : let me cut the cable ; And , when we are put off , fall to their throats : All there is thine .
POMPEY : Ah , this thou shouldst have done , And not have spoke on 't ! In me ' tis villany ; In thee 't had been good service . Thou must know , ' Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour ; Mine honour , it . Repent that e 'er thy tongue Hath so betray 'd thine act : being done unknown , I should have found it afterwards well done ; But must condemn it now . Desist , and drink .
MENAS : For this , I 'll never follow thy pall 'd fortunes more . Who seeks , and will not take when once ' tis offer 'd , Shall never find it more .
POMPEY : This health to Lepidus !
MARK ANTONY : Bear him ashore . I 'll pledge it for him , Pompey .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Here 's to thee , Menas !
MENAS : Enobarbus , welcome !
POMPEY : Fill till the cup be hid .
