Soothsayer : In nature 's infinite book of secrecy A little I can read .
ALEXAS : Show him your hand . Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Bring in the banquet quickly ; wine enough Cleopatra 's health to drink .
CHARMIAN : Good sir , give me good fortune .
Soothsayer : I make not , but foresee .
CHARMIAN : Pray , then , foresee me one .
Soothsayer : You shall be yet far fairer than you are .
CHARMIAN : He means in flesh .
IRAS : No , you shall paint when you are old .
CHARMIAN : Wrinkles forbid !
ALEXAS : Vex not his prescience ; be attentive .
CHARMIAN : Hush !
Soothsayer : You shall be more beloving than beloved .
CHARMIAN : I had rather heat my liver with drinking .
ALEXAS : Nay , hear him .
CHARMIAN : Good now , some excellent fortune ! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon , and widow them all : let me have a child at fifty , to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage : find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar , and companion me with my mistress .
Soothsayer : You shall outlive the lady whom you serve .
CHARMIAN : O excellent ! I love long life better than figs .
Soothsayer : You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach .
CHARMIAN : Then belike my children shall have no names : prithee , how many boys and wenches must I have ?
Soothsayer : If every of your wishes had a womb . And fertile every wish , a million .
CHARMIAN : Out , fool ! I forgive thee for a witch .
ALEXAS : You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
CHARMIAN : Nay , come , tell Iras hers .
ALEXAS : We 'll know all our fortunes .
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Mine , and most of our fortunes , to-night , shall be--drunk to bed .
IRAS : There 's a palm presages chastity , if nothing else .
CHARMIAN : E 'en as the o 'erflowing Nilus presageth famine .
IRAS : Go , you wild bedfellow , you cannot soothsay .
CHARMIAN : Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I cannot scratch mine ear . Prithee , tell her but a worky-day fortune .
Soothsayer : Your fortunes are alike .
IRAS : But how , but how ? give me particulars .
Soothsayer : I have said .
IRAS : Am I not an inch of fortune better than she ?
CHARMIAN : Well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than I , where would you choose it ?
IRAS : Not in my husband 's nose .
CHARMIAN : Our worser thoughts heavens mend ! Alexas , --come , his fortune , his fortune ! O , let him marry a woman that cannot go , sweet Isis , I beseech thee ! and let her die too , and give him a worse ! and let worst follow worse , till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave , fifty-fold a cuckold ! Good Isis , hear me this prayer , though thou deny me a matter of more weight ; good Isis , I beseech thee !
IRAS : Amen . Dear goddess , hear that prayer of the people ! for , as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded : therefore , dear Isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly !
CHARMIAN : Amen .
ALEXAS : Lo , now , if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold , they would make themselves whores , but they 'ld do 't !
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Hush ! here comes Antony .
CHARMIAN : Not he ; the queen . Enter CLEOPATRA
CLEOPATRA : Saw you my lord ?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : No , lady .
CLEOPATRA : Was he not here ?
CHARMIAN : No , madam .
CLEOPATRA : He was disposed to mirth ; but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him . Enobarbus !
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS : Madam ?
CLEOPATRA : Seek him , and bring him hither . Where 's Alexas ?
