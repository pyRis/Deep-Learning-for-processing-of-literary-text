KATHARINA : Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing : They call me Katharina that do talk of me .
PETRUCHIO : You lie , in faith ; for you are call 'd plain Kate , And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst ; But Kate , the prettiest Kate in Christendom Kate of Kate Hall , my super-dainty Kate , For dainties are all Kates , and therefore , Kate , Take this of me , Kate of my consolation ; Hearing thy mildness praised in every town , Thy virtues spoke of , and thy beauty sounded , Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs , Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife .
KATHARINA : Moved ! in good time : let him that moved you hither Remove you hence : I knew you at the first You were a moveable .
PETRUCHIO : Why , what 's a moveable ?
KATHARINA : A join 'd-stool .
PETRUCHIO : Thou hast hit it : come , sit on me .
KATHARINA : Asses are made to bear , and so are you .
PETRUCHIO : Women are made to bear , and so are you .
KATHARINA : No such jade as you , if me you mean .
PETRUCHIO : Alas ! good Kate , I will not burden thee ; For , knowing thee to be but young and light--
KATHARINA : Too light for such a swain as you to catch ; And yet as heavy as my weight should be .
PETRUCHIO : Should be ! should--buzz !
KATHARINA : Well ta 'en , and like a buzzard .
PETRUCHIO : O slow-wing 'd turtle ! shall a buzzard take thee ?
KATHARINA : Ay , for a turtle , as he takes a buzzard .
PETRUCHIO : Come , come , you wasp ; i ' faith , you are too angry .
KATHARINA : If I be waspish , best beware my sting .
PETRUCHIO : My remedy is then , to pluck it out .
KATHARINA : Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies ,
PETRUCHIO : Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ? In his tail .
KATHARINA : In his tongue .
PETRUCHIO : Whose tongue ?
KATHARINA : Yours , if you talk of tails : and so farewell .
PETRUCHIO : What , with my tongue in your tail ? nay , come again , Good Kate ; I am a gentleman .
KATHARINA : That I 'll try . She strikes him
PETRUCHIO : I swear I 'll cuff you , if you strike again .
KATHARINA : So may you lose your arms : If you strike me , you are no gentleman ; And if no gentleman , why then no arms .
PETRUCHIO : A herald , Kate ? O , put me in thy books !
KATHARINA : What is your crest ? a coxcomb ?
PETRUCHIO : A combless cock , so Kate will be my hen .
KATHARINA : No cock of mine ; you crow too like a craven .
PETRUCHIO : Nay , come , Kate , come ; you must not look so sour .
KATHARINA : It is my fashion , when I see a crab .
PETRUCHIO : Why , here 's no crab ; and therefore look not sour .
KATHARINA : There is , there is .
PETRUCHIO : Then show it me .
KATHARINA : Had I a glass , I would .
PETRUCHIO : What , you mean my face ?
KATHARINA : Well aim 'd of such a young one .
PETRUCHIO : Now , by Saint George , I am too young for you .
KATHARINA : Yet you are wither 'd .
PETRUCHIO : ' Tis with cares .
KATHARINA : I care not .
PETRUCHIO : Nay , hear you , Kate : in sooth you scape not so .
KATHARINA : I chafe you , if I tarry : let me go .
