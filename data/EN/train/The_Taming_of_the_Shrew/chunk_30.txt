PETRUCHIO : What is his name ?
VINCENTIO : Lucentio , gentle sir .
PETRUCHIO : Happily we met ; the happier for thy son . And now by law , as well as reverend age , I may entitle thee my loving father : The sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , Thy son by this hath married . Wonder not , Nor be grieved : she is of good esteem , Her dowery wealthy , and of worthy birth ; Beside , so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman . Let me embrace with old Vincentio , And wander we to see thy honest son , Who will of thy arrival be full joyous .
VINCENTIO : But is it true ? or else is it your pleasure , Like pleasant travellers , to break a jest Upon the company you overtake ?
HORTENSIO : I do assure thee , father , so it is .
PETRUCHIO : Come , go along , and see the truth hereof ; For our first merriment hath made thee jealous .
HORTENSIO : Well , Petruchio , this has put me in heart . Have to my widow ! and if she be froward , Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward . Exit GREMIO discovered . Enter behind BIONDELLO , LUCENTIO , and BIANCA
BIONDELLO : Softly and swiftly , sir ; for the priest is ready .
LUCENTIO : I fly , Biondello : but they may chance to need thee at home ; therefore leave us .
BIONDELLO : Nay , faith , I 'll see the church o ' your back ; and then come back to my master 's as soon as I can .
GREMIO : I marvel Cambio comes not all this while . Enter PETRUCHIO , KATHARINA , VINCENTIO , GRUMIO , with Attendants
PETRUCHIO : Sir , here 's the door , this is Lucentio 's house : My father 's bears more toward the market-place ; Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir .
VINCENTIO : You shall not choose but drink before you go : I think I shall command your welcome here , And , by all likelihood , some cheer is toward . Knocks
GREMIO : They 're busy within ; you were best knock louder . Pedant looks out of the window
Pedant : What 's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate ?
VINCENTIO : Is Signior Lucentio within , sir ?
Pedant : He 's within , sir , but not to be spoken withal .
VINCENTIO : What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two , to make merry withal ?
Pedant : Keep your hundred pounds to yourself : he shall need none , so long as I live .
PETRUCHIO : Nay , I told you your son was well beloved in Padua . Do you hear , sir ? To leave frivolous circumstances , I pray you , tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa , and is here at the door to speak with him .
Pedant : Thou liest : his father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window .
VINCENTIO : Art thou his father ?
Pedant : Ay , sir ; so his mother says , if I may believe her .
PETRUCHIO : Why , how now , gentleman ! why , this is flat knavery , to take upon you another man 's name .
Pedant : Lay hands on the villain : I believe a ' means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance . Re-enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO : I have seen them in the church together : God send ' em good shipping ! But who is here ? mine old master Vincentio ! now we are undone and brought to nothing .
VINCENTIO : Come hither , crack-hemp .
BIONDELLO : Hope I may choose , sir .
VINCENTIO : Come hither , you rogue . What , have you forgot me ?
BIONDELLO : Forgot you ! no , sir : I could not forget you , for I never saw you before in all my life .
VINCENTIO : What , you notorious villain , didst thou never see thy master 's father , Vincentio ?
BIONDELLO : What , my old worshipful old master ? yes , marry , sir : see where he looks out of the window .
