BIONDELLO : Help , help , help ! here 's a madman will murder me . Exit
Pedant : Help , son ! help , Signior Baptista ! Exit from above
PETRUCHIO : Prithee , Kate , let 's stand aside and see the end of this controversy . They retire Re-enter Pedant below ; TRANIO , BAPTISTA , and Servants
TRANIO : Sir , what are you that offer to beat my servant ?
VINCENTIO : What am I , sir ! nay , what are you , sir ? O immortal gods ! O fine villain ! A silken doublet ! a velvet hose ! a scarlet cloak ! and a copatain hat ! O , I am undone ! I am undone ! while I play the good husband at home , my son and my servant spend all at the university .
TRANIO : How now ! what 's the matter ?
BAPTISTA : What , is the man lunatic ?
TRANIO : Sir , you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit , but your words show you a madman . Why , sir , what ' cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold ? I thank my good father , I am able to maintain it .
VINCENTIO : Thy father ! O villain ! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
BAPTISTA : You mistake , sir , you mistake , sir . Pray , what do you think is his name ?
VINCENTIO : His name ! as if I knew not his name : I have brought him up ever since he was three years old , and his name is Tranio .
Pedant : Away , away , mad ass ! his name is Lucentio and he is mine only son , and heir to the lands of me , Signior Vincentio .
VINCENTIO : Lucentio ! O , he hath murdered his master ! Lay hold on him , I charge you , in the duke 's name . O , my son , my son ! Tell me , thou villain , where is my son Lucentio ?
TRANIO : Call forth an officer . Enter one with an Officer Carry this mad knave to the gaol . Father Baptista , I charge you see that he be forthcoming .
VINCENTIO : Carry me to the gaol !
GREMIO : Stay , officer : he shall not go to prison .
BAPTISTA : Talk not , Signior Gremio : I say he shall go to prison .
GREMIO : Take heed , Signior Baptista , lest you be cony-catched in this business : I dare swear this is the right Vincentio .
Pedant : Swear , if thou darest .
GREMIO : Nay , I dare not swear it .
TRANIO : Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio .
GREMIO : Yes , I know thee to be Signior Lucentio .
BAPTISTA : Away with the dotard ! to the gaol with him !
VINCENTIO : Thus strangers may be hailed and abused : O monstrous villain ! Re-enter BIONDELLO , with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
BIONDELLO : O ! we are spoiled and--yonder he is : deny him , forswear him , or else we are all undone .
LUCENTIO : Pardon , sweet father .
VINCENTIO : Lives my sweet son ?
BIANCA : Pardon , dear father .
BAPTISTA : How hast thou offended ? Where is Lucentio ?
LUCENTIO : Here 's Lucentio , Right son to the right Vincentio ; That have by marriage made thy daughter mine , While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne .
GREMIO : Here 's packing , with a witness to deceive us all !
VINCENTIO : Where is that damned villain Tranio , That faced and braved me in this matter so ?
BAPTISTA : Why , tell me , is not this my Cambio ?
BIANCA : Cambio is changed into Lucentio .
LUCENTIO : Love wrought these miracles . Bianca 's love Made me exchange my state with Tranio , While he did bear my countenance in the town ; And happily I have arrived at the last Unto the wished haven of my bliss . What Tranio did , myself enforced him to ; Then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake .
VINCENTIO : I 'll slit the villain 's nose , that would have sent me to the gaol .
