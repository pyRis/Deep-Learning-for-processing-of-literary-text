PETRUCHIO : First kiss me , Kate , and we will .
KATHARINA : What , in the midst of the street ?
PETRUCHIO : What , art thou ashamed of me ?
KATHARINA : No , sir , God forbid ; but ashamed to kiss .
PETRUCHIO : Why , then let 's home again . Come , sirrah , let 's away .

LUCENTIO : At last , though long , our jarring notes agree : And time it is , when raging war is done , To smile at scapes and perils overblown . My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , While I with self-same kindness welcome thine . Brother Petruchio , sister Katharina , And thou , Hortensio , with thy loving widow , Feast with the best , and welcome to my house : My banquet is to close our stomachs up , After our great good cheer . Pray you , sit down ; For now we sit to chat as well as eat .
PETRUCHIO : Nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat !
BAPTISTA : Padua affords this kindness , son Petruchio .
PETRUCHIO : Padua affords nothing but what is kind .
HORTENSIO : For both our sakes , I would that word were true .
PETRUCHIO : Now , for my life , Hortensio fears his widow .
Widow : Then never trust me , if I be afeard .
PETRUCHIO : You are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : I mean , Hortensio is afeard of you .
Widow : He that is giddy thinks the world turns round .
PETRUCHIO : Roundly replied .
KATHARINA : Mistress , how mean you that ?
Widow : Thus I conceive by him .
PETRUCHIO : Conceives by me ! How likes Hortensio that ?
HORTENSIO : My widow says , thus she conceives her tale .
PETRUCHIO : Very well mended . Kiss him for that , good widow .
KATHARINA : ' He that is giddy thinks the world turns round : ' I pray you , tell me what you meant by that .
Widow : Your husband , being troubled with a shrew , Measures my husband 's sorrow by his woe : And now you know my meaning ,
KATHARINA : A very mean meaning .
Widow : Right , I mean you .
KATHARINA : And I am mean indeed , respecting you .
PETRUCHIO : To her , Kate !
HORTENSIO : To her , widow !
PETRUCHIO : A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down .
HORTENSIO : That 's my office .
PETRUCHIO : Spoke like an officer ; ha ' to thee , lad ! Drinks to HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA : How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks ?
GREMIO : Believe me , sir , they butt together well .
BIANCA : Head , and butt ! an hasty-witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn .
VINCENTIO : Ay , mistress bride , hath that awaken 'd you ?
BIANCA : Ay , but not frighted me ; therefore I 'll sleep again .
PETRUCHIO : Nay , that you shall not : since you have begun , Have at you for a bitter jest or two !
