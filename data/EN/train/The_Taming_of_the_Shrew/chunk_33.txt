PETRUCHIO : She hath prevented me . Here , Signior Tranio . This bird you aim 'd at , though you hit her not ; Therefore a health to all that shot and miss 'd .
TRANIO : O , sir , Lucentio slipp 'd me like his greyhound , Which runs himself and catches for his master .
PETRUCHIO : A good swift simile , but something currish .
TRANIO : ' Tis well , sir , that you hunted for yourself : ' Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay .
BAPTISTA : O ho , Petruchio ! Tranio hits you now .
LUCENTIO : I thank thee for that gird , good Tranio .
HORTENSIO : Confess , confess , hath he not hit you here ?
PETRUCHIO : A ' has a little gall 'd me , I confess ; And , as the jest did glance away from me , ' Tis ten to one it maim 'd you two outright .
BAPTISTA : Now , in good sadness , son Petruchio , I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all .
PETRUCHIO : Well , I say no : and therefore for assurance Let 's each one send unto his wife ; And he whose wife is most obedient To come at first when he doth send for her , Shall win the wager which we will propose .
HORTENSIO : Content . What is the wager ?
LUCENTIO : Twenty crowns .
PETRUCHIO : Twenty crowns ! I 'll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife .
LUCENTIO : A hundred then .
HORTENSIO : Content .
PETRUCHIO : A match ! ' tis done .
HORTENSIO : Who shall begin ?
LUCENTIO : That will I. Go , Biondello , bid your mistress come to me .
BIONDELLO : I go . Exit
BAPTISTA : Son , I 'll be your half , Bianca comes .
LUCENTIO : I 'll have no halves ; I 'll bear it all myself . Re-enter BIONDELLO How now ! what news ?
BIONDELLO : Sir , my mistress sends you word That she is busy and she cannot come .
PETRUCHIO : How ! she is busy and she cannot come ! Is that an answer ?
GREMIO : Ay , and a kind one too : Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
PETRUCHIO : I hope better .
HORTENSIO : Sirrah Biondello , go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith . Exit BIONDELLO
PETRUCHIO : O , ho ! entreat her ! Nay , then she must needs come .
HORTENSIO : I am afraid , sir , Do what you can , yours will not be entreated . Re-enter BIONDELLO Now , where 's my wife ?
BIONDELLO : She says you have some goodly jest in hand : She will not come : she bids you come to her .
PETRUCHIO : Worse and worse ; she will not come ! O vile , Intolerable , not to be endured ! Sirrah Grumio , go to your mistress ; Say , I command her to come to me . Exit GRUMIO
HORTENSIO : I know her answer .
PETRUCHIO : What ?
HORTENSIO : She will not .
PETRUCHIO : The fouler fortune mine , and there an end .
BAPTISTA : Now , by my holidame , here comes Katharina ! Re-enter KATARINA
KATHARINA : What is your will , sir , that you send for me ?
PETRUCHIO : Where is your sister , and Hortensio 's wife ?
KATHARINA : They sit conferring by the parlor fire .
PETRUCHIO : Go fetch them hither : if they deny to come . Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands : Away , I say , and bring them hither straight . Exit KATHARINA
LUCENTIO : Here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .
HORTENSIO : And so it is : I wonder what it bodes .
PETRUCHIO : Marry , peace it bodes , and love and quiet life , And awful rule and right supremacy ; And , to be short , what not , that 's sweet and happy ?
