EMILIA : I do beseech you That I may speak with you , O , good my lord !
OTHELLO : I had forgot thee : O , come in , Emilia ; Soft ; by and by . Let me the curtains draw . Where art thou ? Unlocks the door Enter EMILIA What 's the matter with thee now ?
EMILIA : O , my good lord , yonder 's foul murders done !
OTHELLO : What , now ?
EMILIA : But now , my lord .
OTHELLO : It is the very error of the moon ; She comes more nearer earth than she was wont , And makes men mad .
EMILIA : Cassio , my lord , hath kill 'd a young Venetian Call 'd Roderigo .
OTHELLO : Roderigo kill 'd ! And Cassio kill 'd !
EMILIA : No , Cassio is not kill 'd .
OTHELLO : Not Cassio kill 'd ! then murder 's out of tune , And sweet revenge grows harsh .
DESDEMONA : O , falsely , falsely murder 'd !
EMILIA : Alas , what cry is that ?
OTHELLO : That ! what ?
EMILIA : Out , and alas ! that was my lady 's voice . Help ! help , ho ! help ! O lady , speak again ! Sweet Desdemona ! O sweet mistress , speak !
DESDEMONA : A guiltless death I die .
EMILIA : O , who hath done this deed ?
DESDEMONA : Nobody ; I myself . Farewell Commend me to my kind lord : O , farewell ! Dies
OTHELLO : Why , how should she be murder 'd ?
EMILIA : Alas , who knows ?
OTHELLO : You heard her say herself , it was not I.
EMILIA : She said so : I must needs report the truth .
OTHELLO : She 's , like a liar , gone to burning hell : ' Twas I that kill 'd her .
EMILIA : O , the more angel she , And you the blacker devil !
OTHELLO : She turn 'd to folly , and she was a whore .
EMILIA : Thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
OTHELLO : She was false as water .
EMILIA : Thou art rash as fire , to say That she was false : O , she was heavenly true !
OTHELLO : Cassio did top her ; ask thy husband else . O , I were damn 'd beneath all depth in hell , But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity . Thy husband knew it all .
EMILIA : My husband !
OTHELLO : Thy husband .
EMILIA : That she was false to wedlock ?
OTHELLO : Ay , with Cassio . Nay , had she been true , If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite , I 'ld not have sold her for it .
EMILIA : My husband !
OTHELLO : Ay , ' twas he that told me first : An honest man he is , and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds .
EMILIA : My husband !
OTHELLO : What needs this iteration , woman ? I say thy husband .
EMILIA : O mistress , villany hath made mocks with love , My husband say that she was false !
OTHELLO : He , woman ; I say thy husband : dost understand the word ? My friend , thy husband , honest , honest Iago .
EMILIA : If he say so , may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day ! he lies to the heart : She was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
OTHELLO : Ha !
EMILIA : Do thy worst : This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her .
OTHELLO : Peace , you were best .
EMILIA : Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt . O gull ! O dolt ! As ignorant as dirt ! thou hast done a deed-- I care not for thy sword ; I 'll make thee known , Though I lost twenty lives.--Help ! help , ho ! help ! The Moor hath kill 'd my mistress ! Murder ! murder ! Enter MONTANO , GRATIANO , IAGO , and others
