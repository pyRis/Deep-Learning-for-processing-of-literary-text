DESDEMONA : By heaven , you do me wrong .
OTHELLO : Are you not a strumpet ?
DESDEMONA : No , as I am a Christian : If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet , I am none .
OTHELLO : What , not a whore ?
DESDEMONA : No , as I shall be saved .
OTHELLO : Is 't possible ?
DESDEMONA : O , heaven forgive us !
OTHELLO : I cry you mercy , then : I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello . Raising his voice You , mistress , That have the office opposite to Saint Peter , And keep the gate of hell ! Re-enter EMILIA You , you , ay , you ! We have done our course ; there 's money for your pains : I pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel . Exit
EMILIA : Alas , what does this gentleman conceive ? How do you , madam ? how do you , my good lady ?
DESDEMONA : ' Faith , half asleep .
EMILIA : Good madam , what 's the matter with my lord ?
DESDEMONA : With who ?
EMILIA : Why , with my lord , madam .
DESDEMONA : Who is thy lord ?
EMILIA : He that is yours , sweet lady .
DESDEMONA : I have none : do not talk to me , Emilia ; I cannot weep ; nor answer have I none , But what should go by water . Prithee , tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets : remember ; And call thy husband hither .
EMILIA : Here 's a change indeed ! Exit
DESDEMONA : ' Tis meet I should be used so , very meet . How have I been behaved , that he might stick The small 'st opinion on my least misuse ? Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO
IAGO : What is your pleasure , madam ? How is 't with you ?
DESDEMONA : I cannot tell . Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks : He might have chid me so ; for , in good faith , I am a child to chiding .
IAGO : What 's the matter , lady ?
EMILIA : Alas , Iago , my lord hath so bewhored her . Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her , As true hearts cannot bear .
DESDEMONA : Am I that name , Iago ?
IAGO : What name , fair lady ?
DESDEMONA : Such as she says my lord did say I was .
EMILIA : He call 'd her whore : a beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his callat .
IAGO : Why did he so ?
DESDEMONA : I do not know ; I am sure I am none such .
IAGO : Do not weep , do not weep . Alas the day !
EMILIA : Hath she forsook so many noble matches , Her father and her country and her friends , To be call 'd whore ? would it not make one weep ?
DESDEMONA : It is my wretched fortune .
IAGO : Beshrew him for 't ! How comes this trick upon him ?
DESDEMONA : Nay , heaven doth know .
EMILIA : I will be hang 'd , if some eternal villain , Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , Have not devised this slander ; I 'll be hang 'd else .
IAGO : Fie , there is no such man ; it is impossible .
DESDEMONA : If any such there be , heaven pardon him !
EMILIA : A halter pardon him ! and hell gnaw his bones ! Why should he call her whore ? who keeps her company ? What place ? what time ? what form ? what likelihood ? The Moor 's abused by some most villanous knave , Some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow . O heaven , that such companions thou 'ldst unfold , And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to the west !
IAGO : Speak within door .
