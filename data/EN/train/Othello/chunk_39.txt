OTHELLO : If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace , Solicit for it straight .
DESDEMONA : Alas , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
OTHELLO : Well , do it , and be brief ; I will walk by : I would not kill thy unprepared spirit ; No ; heaven forfend ! I would not kill thy soul .
DESDEMONA : Talk you of killing ?
OTHELLO : Ay , I do .
DESDEMONA : Then heaven Have mercy on me !
OTHELLO : Amen , with all my heart !
DESDEMONA : If you say so , I hope you will not kill me .
OTHELLO : Hum !
DESDEMONA : And yet I fear you ; for you are fatal then When your eyes roll so : why I should fear I know not , Since guiltiness I know not ; but yet I feel I fear .
OTHELLO : Think on thy sins .
DESDEMONA : They are loves I bear to you .
OTHELLO : Ay , and for that thou diest .
DESDEMONA : That death 's unnatural that kills for loving . Alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ? Some bloody passion shakes your very frame : These are portents ; but yet I hope , I hope , They do not point on me .
OTHELLO : Peace , and be still !
DESDEMONA : I will so . What 's the matter ?
OTHELLO : That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee Thou gavest to Cassio .
DESDEMONA : No , by my life and soul ! Send for the man , and ask him .
OTHELLO : Sweet soul , take heed , Take heed of perjury ; thou art on thy deathbed .
DESDEMONA : Ay , but not yet to die .
OTHELLO : Yes , presently : Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin ; For to deny each article with oath Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal . Thou art to die .
DESDEMONA : Then Lord have mercy on me !
OTHELLO : I say , amen .
DESDEMONA : And have you mercy too ! I never did Offend you in my life ; never loved Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love : I never gave him token .
OTHELLO : By heaven , I saw my handkerchief in 's hand . O perjured woman ! thou dost stone my heart , And makest me call what I intend to do A murder , which I thought a sacrifice : I saw the handkerchief .
DESDEMONA : He found it then ; I never gave it him : send for him hither ; Let him confess a truth .
OTHELLO : He hath confess 'd .
DESDEMONA : What , my lord ?
OTHELLO : That he hath used thee .
DESDEMONA : How ? unlawfully ?
OTHELLO : Ay .
DESDEMONA : He will not say so .
OTHELLO : No , his mouth is stopp 'd ; Honest Iago hath ta 'en order for 't .
DESDEMONA : O ! my fear interprets : what , is he dead ?
OTHELLO : Had all his hairs been lives , my great revenge Had stomach for them all .
DESDEMONA : Alas ! he is betray 'd and I undone .
OTHELLO : Out , strumpet ! weep 'st thou for him to my face ?
DESDEMONA : O , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
OTHELLO : Down , strumpet !
DESDEMONA : Kill me to-morrow : let me live to-night !
OTHELLO : Nay , if you strive--
DESDEMONA : But half an hour !
OTHELLO : Being done , there is no pause .
DESDEMONA : But while I say one prayer !
OTHELLO : It is too late . He stifles her
EMILIA : My lord , my lord ! what , ho ! my lord , my lord !
OTHELLO : What noise is this ? Not dead ? not yet quite dead ? I that am cruel am yet merciful ; I would not have thee linger in thy pain : So , so .
EMILIA : What , ho ! my lord , my lord !
OTHELLO : Who 's there ?
EMILIA : O , good my lord , I would speak a word with you !
