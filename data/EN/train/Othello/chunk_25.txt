IAGO : Do not rise yet . Kneels Witness , you ever-burning lights above , You elements that clip us round about , Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit , hands , heart , To wrong 'd Othello 's service ! Let him command , And to obey shall be in me remorse , What bloody business ever . They rise
OTHELLO : I greet thy love , Not with vain thanks , but with acceptance bounteous , And will upon the instant put thee to 't : Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio 's not alive .
IAGO : My friend is dead ; ' tis done at your request : But let her live .
OTHELLO : Damn her , lewd minx ! O , damn her ! Come , go with me apart ; I will withdraw , To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil . Now art thou my lieutenant .
IAGO : I am your own for ever . Enter DESDEMONA , EMILIA , and Clown
DESDEMONA : Do you know , sirrah , where Lieutenant Cassio lies ?
Clown : I dare not say he lies any where .
DESDEMONA : Why , man ?
Clown : He 's a soldier , and for one to say a soldier lies , is stabbing .
DESDEMONA : Go to : where lodges he ?
Clown : To tell you where he lodges , is to tell you where I lie .
DESDEMONA : Can any thing be made of this ?
Clown : I know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
DESDEMONA : Can you inquire him out , and be edified by report ?
Clown : I will catechise the world for him ; that is , make questions , and by them answer .
DESDEMONA : Seek him , bid him come hither : tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
Clown : To do this is within the compass of man 's wit : and therefore I will attempt the doing it . Exit
DESDEMONA : Where should I lose that handkerchief , Emilia ?
EMILIA : I know not , madam .
DESDEMONA : Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes : and , but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are , it were enough To put him to ill thinking .
EMILIA : Is he not jealous ?
DESDEMONA : Who , he ? I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humours from him .
EMILIA : Look , where he comes .
DESDEMONA : I will not leave him now till Cassio Be call 'd to him . Enter OTHELLO How is 't with you , my lord
OTHELLO : Well , my good lady . Aside O , hardness to dissemble ! -- How do you , Desdemona ?
DESDEMONA : Well , my good lord .
OTHELLO : Give me your hand : this hand is moist , my lady .
DESDEMONA : It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow .
OTHELLO : This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart : Hot , hot , and moist : this hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty , fasting and prayer , Much castigation , exercise devout ; For here 's a young and sweating devil here , That commonly rebels . ' Tis a good hand , A frank one .
DESDEMONA : You may , indeed , say so ; For ' twas that hand that gave away my heart .
OTHELLO : A liberal hand : the hearts of old gave hands ; But our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
DESDEMONA : I cannot speak of this . Come now , your promise .
OTHELLO : What promise , chuck ?
DESDEMONA : I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .
OTHELLO : I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me ; Lend me thy handkerchief .
DESDEMONA : Here , my lord .
OTHELLO : That which I gave you .
DESDEMONA : I have it not about me .
OTHELLO : Not ?
