LODOVICO : Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient ? Is this the nature Whom passion could not shake ? whose solid virtue The shot of accident , nor dart of chance , Could neither graze nor pierce ?
IAGO : He is much changed .
LODOVICO : Are his wits safe ? is he not light of brain ?
IAGO : He 's that he is : I may not breathe my censure What he might be : if what he might he is not , I would to heaven he were !
LODOVICO : What , strike his wife !
IAGO : ' Faith , that was not so well ; yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst !
LODOVICO : Is it his use ? Or did the letters work upon his blood , And new-create this fault ?
IAGO : Alas , alas ! It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known . You shall observe him , And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech : do but go after , And mark how he continues .
LODOVICO : I am sorry that I am deceived in him . Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA
OTHELLO : You have seen nothing then ?
EMILIA : Nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
OTHELLO : Yes , you have seen Cassio and she together .
EMILIA : But then I saw no harm , and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them .
