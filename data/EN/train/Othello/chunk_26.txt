OTHELLO : That is a fault . That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give ; She was a charmer , and could almost read The thoughts of people : she told her , while she kept it , ' Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love , but if she lost it Or made gift of it , my father 's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies : she , dying , gave it me ; And bid me , when my fate would have me wive , To give it her . I did so : and take heed on 't ; Make it a darling like your precious eye ; To lose 't or give 't away were such perdition As nothing else could match .
DESDEMONA : Is 't possible ?
OTHELLO : ' Tis true : there 's magic in the web of it : A sibyl , that had number 'd in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses , In her prophetic fury sew 'd the work ; The worms were hallow 'd that did breed the silk ; And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful Conserved of maidens ' hearts .
DESDEMONA : Indeed ! is 't true ?
OTHELLO : Most veritable ; therefore look to 't well .
DESDEMONA : Then would to God that I had never seen 't !
OTHELLO : Ha ! wherefore ?
DESDEMONA : Why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
OTHELLO : Is 't lost ? is 't gone ? speak , is it out o ' the way ?
DESDEMONA : Heaven bless us !
OTHELLO : Say you ?
DESDEMONA : It is not lost ; but what an if it were ?
OTHELLO : How !
DESDEMONA : I say , it is not lost .
OTHELLO : Fetch 't , let me see 't .
DESDEMONA : Why , so I can , sir , but I will not now . This is a trick to put me from my suit : Pray you , let Cassio be received again .
OTHELLO : Fetch me the handkerchief : my mind misgives .
DESDEMONA : Come , come ; You 'll never meet a more sufficient man .
OTHELLO : The handkerchief !
DESDEMONA : I pray , talk me of Cassio .
OTHELLO : The handkerchief !
DESDEMONA : A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love , Shared dangers with you , --
OTHELLO : The handkerchief !
DESDEMONA : In sooth , you are to blame .
OTHELLO : Away ! Exit
EMILIA : Is not this man jealous ?
DESDEMONA : I ne 'er saw this before . Sure , there 's some wonder in this handkerchief : I am most unhappy in the loss of it .
EMILIA : ' Tis not a year or two shows us a man : They are all but stomachs , and we all but food ; To eat us hungerly , and when they are full , They belch us . Look you , Cassio and my husband ! Enter CASSIO and IAGO
IAGO : There is no other way ; ' tis she must do 't : And , lo , the happiness ! go , and importune her .
DESDEMONA : How now , good Cassio ! what 's the news with you ?
CASSIO : Madam , my former suit : I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist , and be a member of his love Whom I with all the office of my heart Entirely honour : I would not be delay 'd . If my offence be of such mortal kind That nor my service past , nor present sorrows , Nor purposed merit in futurity , Can ransom me into his love again , But to know so must be my benefit ; So shall I clothe me in a forced content , And shut myself up in some other course , To fortune 's alms .
