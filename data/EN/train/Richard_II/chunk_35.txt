HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Thy pains , Fitzwater , shall not be forgot ; Right noble is thy merit , well I wot . Enter HENRY PERCY , and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE
HENRY PERCY : The grand conspirator , Abbot of Westminster , With clog of conscience and sour melancholy Hath yielded up his body to the grave ; But here is Carlisle living , to abide Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Carlisle , this is your doom : Choose out some secret place , some reverend room , More than thou hast , and with it joy thy life ; So as thou livest in peace , die free from strife : For though mine enemy thou hast ever been , High sparks of honour in thee have I seen . Enter EXTON , with persons bearing a coffin
EXTON : Great king , within this coffin I present Thy buried fear : herein all breathless lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies , Richard of Bordeaux , by me hither brought .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Exton , I thank thee not ; for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous land .
EXTON : From your own mouth , my lord , did I this deed .
