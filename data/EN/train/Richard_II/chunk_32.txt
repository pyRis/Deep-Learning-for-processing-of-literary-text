DUKE OF YORK : So shall my virtue be his vice 's bawd ; And he shall spend mine honour with his shame , As thriftless sons their scraping fathers ' gold . Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies , Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies : Thou kill 'st me in his life ; giving him breath , The traitor lives , the true man 's put to death .
DUCHESS OF YORK : What ho , my liege ! for God 's sake , let me in .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry ?
DUCHESS OF YORK : A woman , and thy aunt , great king ; ' tis I. Speak with me , pity me , open the door . A beggar begs that never begg 'd before .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Our scene is alter 'd from a serious thing , And now changed to ' The Beggar and the King . ' My dangerous cousin , let your mother in : I know she is come to pray for your foul sin .
DUKE OF YORK : If thou do pardon , whosoever pray , More sins for this forgiveness prosper may . This fester 'd joint cut off , the rest rest sound ; This let alone will all the rest confound . Enter DUCHESS OF YORK
DUCHESS OF YORK : O king , believe not this hard-hearted man ! Love loving not itself none other can .
DUKE OF YORK : Thou frantic woman , what dost thou make here ? Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear ?
DUCHESS OF YORK : Sweet York , be patient . Hear me , gentle liege . Kneels
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Rise up , good aunt .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Not yet , I thee beseech : For ever will I walk upon my knees , And never see day that the happy sees , Till thou give joy ; until thou bid me joy , By pardoning Rutland , my transgressing boy .
DUKE OF AUMERLE : Unto my mother 's prayers I bend my knee .
DUKE OF YORK : Against them both my true joints bended be . Ill mayst thou thrive , if thou grant any grace !
DUCHESS OF YORK : Pleads he in earnest ? look upon his face ; His eyes do drop no tears , his prayers are in jest ; His words come from his mouth , ours from our breast : He prays but faintly and would be denied ; We pray with heart and soul and all beside : His weary joints would gladly rise , I know ; Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow : His prayers are full of false hypocrisy ; Ours of true zeal and deep integrity . Our prayers do out-pray his ; then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Good aunt , stand up .
DUCHESS OF YORK : Nay , do not say , ' stand up ; ' Say , ' pardon ' first , and afterwards ' stand up . ' And if I were thy nurse , thy tongue to teach , ' Pardon ' should be the first word of thy speech . I never long 'd to hear a word till now ; Say ' pardon , ' king ; let pity teach thee how : The word is short , but not so short as sweet ; No word like ' pardon ' for kings ' mouths so meet .
DUKE OF YORK : Speak it in French , king ; say , ' pardonne moi . ' 
DUCHESS OF YORK : Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy ? Ah , my sour husband , my hard-hearted lord , That set 'st the word itself against the word ! Speak ' pardon ' as ' tis current in our land ; The chopping French we do not understand . Thine eye begins to speak ; set thy tongue there ; Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear ; That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce , Pity may move thee ' pardon ' to rehearse .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Good aunt , stand up .
DUCHESS OF YORK : I do not sue to stand ; Pardon is all the suit I have in hand .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I pardon him , as God shall pardon me .
