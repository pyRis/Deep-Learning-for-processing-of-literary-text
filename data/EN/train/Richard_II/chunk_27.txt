KING RICHARD II : No lord of thine , thou haught insulting man , Nor no man 's lord ; I have no name , no title , No , not that name was given me at the font , But ' tis usurp 'd : alack the heavy day , That I have worn so many winters out , And know not now what name to call myself ! O that I were a mockery king of snow , Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke , To melt myself away in water-drops ! Good king , great king , and yet not greatly good , An if my word be sterling yet in England , Let it command a mirror hither straight , That it may show me what a face I have , Since it is bankrupt of his majesty .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass . Exit an attendant
NORTHUMBERLAND : Read o 'er this paper while the glass doth come .
KING RICHARD II : Fiend , thou torment 'st me ere I come to hell !
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Urge it no more , my Lord Northumberland .
NORTHUMBERLAND : The commons will not then be satisfied .
KING RICHARD II : They shall be satisfied : I 'll read enough , When I do see the very book indeed Where all my sins are writ , and that 's myself . Re-enter Attendant , with a glass Give me the glass , and therein will I read . No deeper wrinkles yet ? hath sorrow struck So many blows upon this face of mine , And made no deeper wounds ? O flattering glass , Like to my followers in prosperity , Thou dost beguile me ! Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men ? was this the face That , like the sun , did make beholders wink ? Was this the face that faced so many follies , And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke ? A brittle glory shineth in this face : As brittle as the glory is the face ; Dashes the glass against the ground For there it is , crack 'd in a hundred shivers . Mark , silent king , the moral of this sport , How soon my sorrow hath destroy 'd my face .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy 'd The shadow or your face .
KING RICHARD II : Say that again . The shadow of my sorrow ! ha ! let 's see : ' Tis very true , my grief lies all within ; And these external manners of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortured soul ; There lies the substance : and I thank thee , king , For thy great bounty , that not only givest Me cause to wail but teachest me the way How to lament the cause . I 'll beg one boon , And then be gone and trouble you no more . Shall I obtain it ?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Name it , fair cousin .
KING RICHARD II : ' Fair cousin ' ? I am greater than a king : For when I was a king , my flatterers Were then but subjects ; being now a subject , I have a king here to my flatterer . Being so great , I have no need to beg .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Yet ask .
KING RICHARD II : And shall I have ?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : You shall .
KING RICHARD II : Then give me leave to go .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Whither ?
KING RICHARD II : Whither you will , so I were from your sights .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Go , some of you convey him to the Tower .
KING RICHARD II : O , good ! convey ? conveyers are you all , That rise thus nimbly by a true king 's fall .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : On Wednesday next we solemnly set down Our coronation : lords , prepare yourselves. and DUKE OF AUMERLE
Abbot : A woeful pageant have we here beheld .
BISHOP OF CARLISLE : The woe 's to come ; the children yet unborn . Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn .
DUKE OF AUMERLE : You holy clergymen , is there no plot To rid the realm of this pernicious blot ?
