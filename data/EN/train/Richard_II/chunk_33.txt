Good uncle , help to order several powers To Oxford , or where 'er these traitors are : They shall not live within this world , I swear , But I will have them , if I once know where .

EXTON : ' Have I no friend ? ' quoth he : he spake it twice , And urged it twice together , did he not ?
Servant : He did .
EXTON : And speaking it , he wistly look 'd on me , And who should say , ' I would thou wert the man ' That would divorce this terror from my heart ; ' Meaning the king at Pomfret . Come , let 's go : I am the king 's friend , and will rid his foe . Enter KING RICHARD
