BISHOP OF CARLISLE : My lord , wise men ne 'er sit and wail their woes , But presently prevent the ways to wail . To fear the foe , since fear oppresseth strength , Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe , And so your follies fight against yourself . Fear and be slain ; no worse can come to fight : And fight and die is death destroying death ; Where fearing dying pays death servile breath .
DUKE OF AUMERLE : My father hath a power ; inquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb .
KING RICHARD II : Thou chidest me well : proud Bolingbroke , I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom . This ague fit of fear is over-blown ; An easy task it is to win our own . Say , Scroop , where lies our uncle with his power ? Speak sweetly , man , although thy looks be sour .
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP : Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state and inclination of the day : So may you by my dull and heavy eye , My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say . I play the torturer , by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken : Your uncle York is join 'd with Bolingbroke , And all your northern castles yielded up , And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party .
KING RICHARD II : Thou hast said enough . Beshrew thee , cousin , which didst lead me forth To DUKE OF AUMERLE Of that sweet way I was in to despair ! What say you now ? what comfort have we now ? By heaven , I 'll hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more . Go to Flint castle : there I 'll pine away ; A king , woe 's slave , shall kingly woe obey . That power I have , discharge ; and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow , For I have none : let no man speak again To alter this , for counsel is but vain .
DUKE OF AUMERLE : My liege , one word .
KING RICHARD II : He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue . Discharge my followers : let them hence away , From Richard 's night to Bolingbroke 's fair day . Enter , with drum and colours , HENRY BOLINGBROKE , DUKE OF YORK , NORTHUMBERLAND , Attendants , and forces
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : So that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispersed , and Salisbury Is gone to meet the king , who lately landed With some few private friends upon this coast .
NORTHUMBERLAND : The news is very fair and good , my lord : Richard not far from hence hath hid his head .
DUKE OF YORK : It would beseem the Lord Northumberland To say ' King Richard : ' alack the heavy day When such a sacred king should hide his head .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Your grace mistakes ; only to be brief Left I his title out .
DUKE OF YORK : The time hath been , Would you have been so brief with him , he would Have been so brief with you , to shorten you , For taking so the head , your whole head 's length .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Mistake not , uncle , further than you should .
DUKE OF YORK : Take not , good cousin , further than you should . Lest you mistake the heavens are o 'er our heads .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : I know it , uncle , and oppose not myself Against their will . But who comes here ? Enter HENRY PERCY Welcome , Harry : what , will not this castle yield ?
HENRY PERCY : The castle royally is mann 'd , my lord , Against thy entrance .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Royally ! Why , it contains no king ?
HENRY PERCY : Yes , my good lord , It doth contain a king ; King Richard lies Within the limits of yon lime and stone : And with him are the Lord Aumerle , Lord Salisbury , Sir Stephen Scroop , besides a clergyman Of holy reverence ; who , I cannot learn .
