NORTHUMBERLAND : Well , lords , the Duke of Lancaster is dead .
LORD ROSS : And living too ; for now his son is duke .
LORD WILLOUGHBY : Barely in title , not in revenue .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Richly in both , if justice had her right .
LORD ROSS : My heart is great ; but it must break with silence , Ere 't be disburden 'd with a liberal tongue .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Nay , speak thy mind ; and let him ne 'er speak more That speaks thy words again to do thee harm !
LORD WILLOUGHBY : Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford ? If it be so , out with it boldly , man ; Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him .
LORD ROSS : No good at all that I can do for him ; Unless you call it good to pity him , Bereft and gelded of his patrimony .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Now , afore God , ' tis shame such wrongs are borne In him , a royal prince , and many moe Of noble blood in this declining land . The king is not himself , but basely led By flatterers ; and what they will inform , Merely in hate , ' gainst any of us all , That will the king severely prosecute ' Gainst us , our lives , our children , and our heirs .
LORD ROSS : The commons hath he pill 'd with grievous taxes , And quite lost their hearts : the nobles hath he fined For ancient quarrels , and quite lost their hearts .
LORD WILLOUGHBY : And daily new exactions are devised , As blanks , benevolences , and I wot not what : But what , o ' God 's name , doth become of this ?
NORTHUMBERLAND : Wars have not wasted it , for warr 'd he hath not , But basely yielded upon compromise That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows : More hath he spent in peace than they in wars .
LORD ROSS : The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm .
LORD WILLOUGHBY : The king 's grown bankrupt , like a broken man .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him .
LORD ROSS : He hath not money for these Irish wars , His burthenous taxations notwithstanding , But by the robbing of the banish 'd duke .
NORTHUMBERLAND : His noble kinsman : most degenerate king ! But , lords , we hear this fearful tempest sing , Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm ; We see the wind sit sore upon our sails , And yet we strike not , but securely perish .
LORD ROSS : We see the very wreck that we must suffer ; And unavoided is the danger now , For suffering so the causes of our wreck .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Not so ; even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering ; but I dare not say How near the tidings of our comfort is .
LORD WILLOUGHBY : Nay , let us share thy thoughts , as thou dost ours .
LORD ROSS : Be confident to speak , Northumberland : We three are but thyself ; and , speaking so , Thy words are but as thoughts ; therefore , be bold .
