DUKE OF YORK : Which for some reasons , sir , I mean to see . I fear , I fear , --
DUCHESS OF YORK : What should you fear ? ' Tis nothing but some bond , that he is enter 'd into For gay apparel ' gainst the triumph day .
DUKE OF YORK : Bound to himself ! what doth he with a bond That he is bound to ? Wife , thou art a fool . Boy , let me see the writing .

DUCHESS OF YORK : Why , York , what wilt thou do ? Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own ? Have we more sons ? or are we like to have ? Is not my teeming date drunk up with time ? And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age , And rob me of a happy mother 's name ? Is he not like thee ? is he not thine own ?

DUKE OF YORK : Away , fond woman ! were he twenty times my son , I would appeach him .
