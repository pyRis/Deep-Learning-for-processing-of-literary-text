DUKE OF YORK : Make way , unruly woman ! Exit
DUCHESS OF YORK : After , Aumerle ! mount thee upon his horse ; Spur post , and get before him to the king , And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee . I 'll not be long behind ; though I be old , I doubt not but to ride as fast as York : And never will I rise up from the ground Till Bolingbroke have pardon 'd thee . Away , be gone ! Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE , HENRY PERCY , and other Lords
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son ? ' Tis full three months since I did see him last ; If any plague hang over us , ' tis he . I would to God , my lords , he might be found : Inquire at London , ' mongst the taverns there , For there , they say , he daily doth frequent , With unrestrained loose companions , Even such , they say , as stand in narrow lanes , And beat our watch , and rob our passengers ; Which he , young wanton and effeminate boy , Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crew .
HENRY PERCY : My lord , some two days since I saw the prince , And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : And what said the gallant ?
HENRY PERCY : His answer was , he would unto the stews , And from the common 'st creature pluck a glove , And wear it as a favour ; and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : As dissolute as desperate ; yet through both I see some sparks of better hope , which elder years May happily bring forth . But who comes here ? Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE
DUKE OF AUMERLE : Where is the king ?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : What means our cousin , that he stares and looks So wildly ?
DUKE OF AUMERLE : God save your grace ! I do beseech your majesty , To have some conference with your grace alone .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Withdraw yourselves , and leave us here alone . What is the matter with our cousin now ?
DUKE OF AUMERLE : For ever may my knees grow to the earth , My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Intended or committed was this fault ? If on the first , how heinous e 'er it be , To win thy after-love I pardon thee .
DUKE OF AUMERLE : Then give me leave that I may turn the key , That no man enter till my tale be done .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Have thy desire .
DUKE OF YORK : My liege , beware ; look to thyself ; Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there .
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : Villain , I 'll make thee safe . Drawing
DUKE OF AUMERLE : Stay thy revengeful hand ; thou hast no cause to fear .
DUKE OF YORK : Open the door , secure , foolhardy king : Shall I for love speak treason to thy face ? Open the door , or I will break it open . Enter DUKE OF YORK
HENRY BOLINGBROKE : What is the matter , uncle ? speak ; Recover breath ; tell us how near is danger , That we may arm us to encounter it .
DUKE OF YORK : Peruse this writing here , and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show .
DUKE OF AUMERLE : Remember , as thou read 'st , thy promise pass 'd : I do repent me ; read not my name there My heart is not confederate with my hand .
DUKE OF YORK : It was , villain , ere thy hand did set it down . I tore it from the traitor 's bosom , king ; Fear , and not love , begets his penitence : Forget to pity him , lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart .
