HELICANUS : My lord , I hear none .
PERICLES : None ! The music of the spheres ! List , my Marina .
LYSIMACHUS : It is not good to cross him ; give him way .
PERICLES : Rarest sounds ! Do ye not hear ?
LYSIMACHUS : My lord , I hear . Music
PERICLES : Most heavenly music ! It nips me unto listening , and thick slumber Hangs upon mine eyes : let me rest . Sleeps
LYSIMACHUS : A pillow for his head : So , leave him all . Well , my companion friends , If this but answer to my just belief , I 'll well remember you . DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision
DIANA : My temple stands in Ephesus : hie thee thither , And do upon mine altar sacrifice . There , when my maiden priests are met together , Before the people all , Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife : To mourn thy crosses , with thy daughter 's , call And give them repetition to the life . Or perform my bidding , or thou livest in woe ; Do it , and happy ; by my silver bow ! Awake , and tell thy dream . Disappears
PERICLES : Celestial Dian , goddess argentine , I will obey thee . Helicanus ! Re-enter HELICANUS , LYSIMACHUS , and MARINA
HELICANUS : Sir ?
PERICLES : My purpose was for Tarsus , there to strike The inhospitable Cleon ; but I am For other service first : toward Ephesus Turn our blown sails ; eftsoons I 'll tell thee why . To LYSIMACHUS Shall we refresh us , sir , upon your shore , And give you gold for such provision As our intents will need ?
LYSIMACHUS : Sir , With all my heart ; and , when you come ashore , I have another suit .
PERICLES : You shall prevail , Were it to woo my daughter ; for it seems You have been noble towards her .
LYSIMACHUS : Sir , lend me your arm .
PERICLES : Come , my Marina . SCENE II : Enter GOWER , before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus
GOWER : Now our sands are almost run ; More a little , and then dumb . This , my last boon , give me , For such kindness must relieve me , That you aptly will suppose What pageantry , what feats , what shows , What minstrelsy , and pretty din , The regent made in Mytilene To greet the king . So he thrived , That he is promised to be wived To fair Marina ; but in no wise Till he had done his sacrifice , As Dian bade : whereto being bound , The interim , pray you , all confound . In feather 'd briefness sails are fill 'd , And wishes fall out as they 're will 'd . At Ephesus , the temple see , Our king and all his company . That he can hither come so soon , Is by your fancy 's thankful doom . Exit near the altar , as high priestess ; a number of Virgins on each side ; CERIMON and other Inhabitants of Ephesus attending . Enter PERICLES , with his train ; LYSIMACHUS , HELICANUS , MARINA , and a Lady
PERICLES : Hail , Dian ! to perform thy just command , I here confess myself the king of Tyre ; Who , frighted from my country , did wed At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa . At sea in childbed died she , but brought forth A maid-child call 'd Marina ; who , O goddess , Wears yet thy silver livery . She at Tarsus Was nursed with Cleon ; who at fourteen years He sought to murder : but her better stars Brought her to Mytilene ; ' gainst whose shore Riding , her fortunes brought the maid aboard us , Where , by her own most clear remembrance , she Made known herself my daughter .
THAISA : Voice and favour ! You are , you are--O royal Pericles ! Faints
PERICLES : What means the nun ? she dies ! help , gentlemen !
CERIMON : Noble sir , If you have told Diana 's altar true , This is your wife .
PERICLES : Reverend appearer , no ; I threw her overboard with these very arms .
