SIMONIDES : Traitor , thou liest .
PERICLES : Traitor !
SIMONIDES : Ay , traitor .
PERICLES : Even in his throat--unless it be the king-- That calls me traitor , I return the lie .
SIMONIDES : Now , by the gods , I do applaud his courage .
PERICLES : My actions are as noble as my thoughts , That never relish 'd of a base descent . I came unto your court for honour 's cause , And not to be a rebel to her state ; And he that otherwise accounts of me , This sword shall prove he 's honour 's enemy .
SIMONIDES : No ? Here comes my daughter , she can witness it . Enter THAISA
PERICLES : Then , as you are as virtuous as fair , Resolve your angry father , if my tongue Did ere solicit , or my hand subscribe To any syllable that made love to you .
THAISA : Why , sir , say if you had , Who takes offence at that would make me glad ?
SIMONIDES : Yea , mistress , are you so peremptory ? Aside I am glad on 't with all my heart.-- I 'll tame you ; I 'll bring you in subjection . Will you , not having my consent , Bestow your love and your affections Upon a stranger ? Aside who , for aught I know , May be , nor can I think the contrary , As great in blood as I myself.-- Therefore hear you , mistress ; either frame Your will to mine , --and you , sir , hear you , Either be ruled by me , or I will make you-- Man and wife : Nay , come , your hands and lips must seal it too : And being join 'd , I 'll thus your hopes destroy ; And for a further grief , --God give you joy ! -- What , are you both pleased ?
THAISA : Yes , if you love me , sir .
PERICLES : Even as my life , or blood that fosters it .
SIMONIDES : What , are you both agreed ?
BOTH : Yes , if it please your majesty .
SIMONIDES : It pleaseth me so well , that I will see you wed ; And then with what haste you can get you to bed . Enter GOWER
