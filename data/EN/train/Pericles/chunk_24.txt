Tyrian Sailor : Where is lord Helicanus ? he can resolve you . O , here he is . Sir , there 's a barge put off from Mytilene , And in it is Lysimachus the governor , Who craves to come aboard . What is your will ?
HELICANUS : That he have his . Call up some gentlemen .
Tyrian Sailor : Ho , gentlemen ! my lord calls . Enter two or three Gentlemen
First Gentleman : Doth your lordship call ?
HELICANUS : Gentlemen , there 's some of worth would come aboard ; I pray ye , greet them fairly . The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend , and go on board the barge Enter , from thence , LYSIMACHUS and Lords ; with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors
Tyrian Sailor : Sir , This is the man that can , in aught you would , Resolve you .
LYSIMACHUS : Hail , reverend sir ! the gods preserve you !
HELICANUS : And you , sir , to outlive the age I am , And die as I would do .
LYSIMACHUS : You wish me well . Being on shore , honouring of Neptune 's triumphs , Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us , I made to it , to know of whence you are .
HELICANUS : First , what is your place ?
LYSIMACHUS : I am the governor of this place you lie before .
HELICANUS : Sir , Our vessel is of Tyre , in it the king ; A man who for this three months hath not spoken To any one , nor taken sustenance But to prorogue his grief .
LYSIMACHUS : Upon what ground is his distemperature ?
HELICANUS : ' Twould be too tedious to repeat ; But the main grief springs from the loss Of a beloved daughter and a wife .
LYSIMACHUS : May we not see him ?
HELICANUS : You may ; But bootless is your sight : he will not speak To any .
LYSIMACHUS : Yet let me obtain my wish .
HELICANUS : Behold him . PERICLES discovered This was a goodly person , Till the disaster that , one mortal night , Drove him to this .
LYSIMACHUS : Sir king , all hail ! the gods preserve you ! Hail , royal sir !
HELICANUS : It is in vain ; he will not speak to you .
First Lord : Sir , We have a maid in Mytilene , I durst wager , Would win some words of him .
LYSIMACHUS : ' Tis well bethought . She questionless with her sweet harmony And other chosen attractions , would allure , And make a battery through his deafen 'd parts , Which now are midway stopp 'd : She is all happy as the fairest of all , And , with her fellow maids is now upon The leafy shelter that abuts against The island 's side . Whispers a Lord , who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS
HELICANUS : Sure , all 's effectless ; yet nothing we 'll omit That bears recovery 's name . But , since your kindness We have stretch 'd thus far , let us beseech you That for our gold we may provision have , Wherein we are not destitute for want , But weary for the staleness .
LYSIMACHUS : O , sir , a courtesy Which if we should deny , the most just gods For every graff would send a caterpillar , And so afflict our province . Yet once more Let me entreat to know at large the cause Of your king 's sorrow .
HELICANUS : Sit , sir , I will recount it to you : But , see , I am prevented . Re-enter , from the barge , Lord , with MARINA , and a young Lady
LYSIMACHUS : O , here is The lady that I sent for . Welcome , fair one ! Is 't not a goodly presence ?
HELICANUS : She 's a gallant lady .
