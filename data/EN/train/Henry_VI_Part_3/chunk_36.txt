QUEEN MARGARET : This cheers my heart , to see your forwardness .
OXFORD : Here pitch our battle ; hence we will not budge . Flourish and march . Enter KING EDWARD IV , GLOUCESTER , CLARENCE , and soldiers
KING EDWARD IV : Brave followers , yonder stands the thorny wood , Which , by the heavens ' assistance and your strength , Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night . I need not add more fuel to your fire , For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out Give signal to the fight , and to it , lords !
QUEEN MARGARET : Lords , knights , and gentlemen , what I should say My tears gainsay ; for every word I speak , Ye see , I drink the water of mine eyes . Therefore , no more but this : Henry , your sovereign , Is prisoner to the foe ; his state usurp 'd , His realm a slaughter-house , his subjects slain , His statutes cancell 'd and his treasure spent ; And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil . You fight in justice : then , in God 's name , lords , Be valiant and give signal to the fight . Flourish . Enter KING EDWARD IV , GLOUCESTER , CLARENCE , and soldiers ; with QUEEN MARGARET , OXFORD , and SOMERSET , prisoners
KING EDWARD IV : Now here a period of tumultuous broils . Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight : For Somerset , off with his guilty head . Go , bear them hence ; I will not hear them speak .
OXFORD : For my part , I 'll not trouble thee with words .
SOMERSET : Nor I , but stoop with patience to my fortune .
QUEEN MARGARET : So part we sadly in this troublous world , To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem .
KING EDWARD IV : Is proclamation made , that who finds Edward Shall have a high reward , and he his life ?
GLOUCESTER : It is : and lo , where youthful Edward comes ! Enter soldiers , with PRINCE EDWARD
KING EDWARD IV : Bring forth the gallant , let us hear him speak . What ! can so young a thorn begin to prick ? Edward , what satisfaction canst thou make For bearing arms , for stirring up my subjects , And all the trouble thou hast turn 'd me to ?
PRINCE EDWARD : Speak like a subject , proud ambitious York ! Suppose that I am now my father 's mouth ; Resign thy chair , and where I stand kneel thou , Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee , Which traitor , thou wouldst have me answer to .
QUEEN MARGARET : Ah , that thy father had been so resolved !
GLOUCESTER : That you might still have worn the petticoat , And ne 'er have stol 'n the breech from Lancaster .
PRINCE EDWARD : Let AEsop fable in a winter 's night ; His currish riddles sort not with this place .
GLOUCESTER : By heaven , brat , I 'll plague ye for that word .
QUEEN MARGARET : Ay , thou wast born to be a plague to men .
GLOUCESTER : For God 's sake , take away this captive scold .
PRINCE EDWARD : Nay , take away this scolding crookback rather .
KING EDWARD IV : Peace , wilful boy , or I will charm your tongue .
CLARENCE : Untutor 'd lad , thou art too malapert .
PRINCE EDWARD : I know my duty ; you are all undutiful : Lascivious Edward , and thou perjured George , And thou mis-shapen Dick , I tell ye all I am your better , traitors as ye are : And thou usurp 'st my father 's right and mine .
KING EDWARD IV : Take that , thou likeness of this railer here . Stabs him
GLOUCESTER : Sprawl 'st thou ? take that , to end thy agony . Stabs him
CLARENCE : And there 's for twitting me with perjury . Stabs him
QUEEN MARGARET : O , kill me too !
GLOUCESTER : Marry , and shall . Offers to kill her
KING EDWARD IV : Hold , Richard , hold ; for we have done too much .
GLOUCESTER : Why should she live , to fill the world with words ?
