YORK : He rose against him , being his sovereign , And made him to resign his crown perforce .
WARWICK : Suppose , my lords , he did it unconstrain 'd , Think you ' twere prejudicial to his crown ?
EXETER : No ; for he could not so resign his crown But that the next heir should succeed and reign .
KING HENRY VI : Art thou against us , Duke of Exeter ?
EXETER : His is the right , and therefore pardon me .
YORK : Why whisper you , my lords , and answer not ?
EXETER : My conscience tells me he is lawful king .
KING HENRY VI : All will revolt from me , and turn to him .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Plantagenet , for all the claim thou lay 'st , Think not that Henry shall be so deposed .
WARWICK : Deposed he shall be , in despite of all .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Thou art deceived : ' tis not thy southern power , Of Essex , Norfolk , Suffolk , nor of Kent , Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud , Can set the duke up in despite of me .
CLIFFORD : King Henry , be thy title right or wrong , Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence : May that ground gape and swallow me alive , Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father !
KING HENRY VI : O Clifford , how thy words revive my heart !
YORK : Henry of Lancaster , resign thy crown . What mutter you , or what conspire you , lords ?
WARWICK : Do right unto this princely Duke of York , Or I will fill the house with armed men , And over the chair of state , where now he sits , Write up his title with usurping blood . He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves
KING HENRY VI : My Lord of Warwick , hear me but one word : Let me for this my life-time reign as king .
YORK : Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs , And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest .
KING HENRY VI : I am content : Richard Plantagenet , Enjoy the kingdom after my decease .
CLIFFORD : What wrong is this unto the prince your son !
WARWICK : What good is this to England and himself !
WESTMORELAND : Base , fearful and despairing Henry !
CLIFFORD : How hast thou injured both thyself and us !
WESTMORELAND : I cannot stay to hear these articles .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Nor I.
CLIFFORD : Come , cousin , let us tell the queen these news .
WESTMORELAND : Farewell , faint-hearted and degenerate king , In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Be thou a prey unto the house of York , And die in bands for this unmanly deed !
CLIFFORD : In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome , Or live in peace abandon 'd and despised !
WARWICK : Turn this way , Henry , and regard them not .
EXETER : They seek revenge and therefore will not yield .
KING HENRY VI : Ah , Exeter !
WARWICK : Why should you sigh , my lord ?
KING HENRY VI : Not for myself , Lord Warwick , but my son , Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit . But be it as it may : I here entail The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever ; Conditionally , that here thou take an oath To cease this civil war , and , whilst I live , To honour me as thy king and sovereign , And neither by treason nor hostility To seek to put me down and reign thyself .
YORK : This oath I willingly take and will perform .
WARWICK : Long live King Henry ! Plantagenet embrace him .
KING HENRY VI : And long live thou and these thy forward sons !
YORK : Now York and Lancaster are reconciled .
EXETER : Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes ! Sennet . Here they come down
YORK : Farewell , my gracious lord ; I 'll to my castle .
WARWICK : And I 'll keep London with my soldiers .
NORFOLK : And I to Norfolk with my followers .
