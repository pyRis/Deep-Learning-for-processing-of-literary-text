RIVERS : Madam , what makes you in this sudden change ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Why brother Rivers , are you yet to learn What late misfortune is befall 'n King Edward ?
RIVERS : What ! loss of some pitch 'd battle against Warwick ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : No , but the loss of his own royal person .
RIVERS : Then is my sovereign slain ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Ay , almost slain , for he is taken prisoner , Either betray 'd by falsehood of his guard Or by his foe surprised at unawares : And , as I further have to understand , Is new committed to the Bishop of York , Fell Warwick 's brother and by that our foe .
RIVERS : These news I must confess are full of grief ; Yet , gracious madam , bear it as you may : Warwick may lose , that now hath won the day .
QUEEN ELIZABETH : Till then fair hope must hinder life 's decay . And I the rather wean me from despair For love of Edward 's offspring in my womb : This is it that makes me bridle passion And bear with mildness my misfortune 's cross ; Ay , ay , for this I draw in many a tear And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs , Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown King Edward 's fruit , true heir to the English crown .
RIVERS : But , madam , where is Warwick then become ?
QUEEN ELIZABETH : I am inform 'd that he comes towards London , To set the crown once more on Henry 's head : Guess thou the rest ; King Edward 's friends must down , But , to prevent the tyrant 's violence , -- For trust not him that hath once broken faith , -- I 'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary , To save at least the heir of Edward 's right : There shall I rest secure from force and fraud . Come , therefore , let us fly while we may fly : If Warwick take us we are sure to die . Enter GLOUCESTER , HASTINGS , and STANLEY
GLOUCESTER : Now , my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley , Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither , Into this chiefest thicket of the park . Thus stands the case : you know our king , my brother , Is prisoner to the bishop here , at whose hands He hath good usage and great liberty , And , often but attended with weak guard , Comes hunting this way to disport himself . I have advertised him by secret means That if about this hour he make his way Under the colour of his usual game , He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity . Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him
Huntsman : This way , my lord ; for this way lies the game .
KING EDWARD IV : Nay , this way , man : see where the huntsmen stand . Now , brother of Gloucester , Lord Hastings , and the rest , Stand you thus close , to steal the bishop 's deer ?
GLOUCESTER : Brother , the time and case requireth haste : Your horse stands ready at the park-corner .
KING EDWARD IV : But whither shall we then ?
HASTINGS : To Lynn , my lord , And ship from thence to Flanders .
GLOUCESTER : Well guess 'd , believe me ; for that was my meaning .
KING EDWARD IV : Stanley , I will requite thy forwardness .
GLOUCESTER : But wherefore stay we ? ' tis no time to talk .
KING EDWARD IV : Huntsman , what say 'st thou ? wilt thou go along ?
Huntsman : Better do so than tarry and be hang 'd .
GLOUCESTER : Come then , away ; let 's ha ' no more ado .
KING EDWARD IV : Bishop , farewell : shield thee from Warwick 's frown ; And pray that I may repossess the crown . Flourish . Enter KING HENRY VI , CLARENCE , WARWICK , SOMERSET , HENRY OF RICHMOND , OXFORD , MONTAGUE , and Lieutenant of the Tower
