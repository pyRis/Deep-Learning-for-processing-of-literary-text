NORTHUMBERLAND : Yield to our mercy , proud Plantagenet .
CLIFFORD : Ay , to such mercy as his ruthless arm , With downright payment , show 'd unto my father . Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car , And made an evening at the noontide prick .
YORK : My ashes , as the phoenix , may bring forth A bird that will revenge upon you all : And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven , Scorning whate 'er you can afflict me with . Why come you not ? what ! multitudes , and fear ?
CLIFFORD : So cowards fight when they can fly no further ; So doves do peck the falcon 's piercing talons ; So desperate thieves , all hopeless of their lives , Breathe out invectives ' gainst the officers .
YORK : O Clifford , but bethink thee once again , And in thy thought o 'er-run my former time ; And , if though canst for blushing , view this face , And bite thy tongue , that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this !
CLIFFORD : I will not bandy with thee word for word , But buckle with thee blows , twice two for one .
QUEEN MARGARET : Hold , valiant Clifford ! for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitor 's life . Wrath makes him deaf : speak thou , Northumberland .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Hold , Clifford ! do not honour him so much To prick thy finger , though to wound his heart : What valour were it , when a cur doth grin , For one to thrust his hand between his teeth , When he might spurn him with his foot away ? It is war 's prize to take all vantages ; And ten to one is no impeach of valour . They lay hands on YORK , who struggles
CLIFFORD : Ay , ay , so strives the woodcock with the gin .
NORTHUMBERLAND : So doth the cony struggle in the net .
YORK : So triumph thieves upon their conquer 'd booty ; So true men yield , with robbers so o 'ermatch 'd .
NORTHUMBERLAND : What would your grace have done unto him now ?
