KING HENRY VI : Far be the thought of this from Henry 's heart , To make a shambles of the parliament-house ! Cousin of Exeter , frowns , words and threats Shall be the war that Henry means to use . Thou factious Duke of York , descend my throne , and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet ; I am thy sovereign .
YORK : I am thine .
EXETER : For shame , come down : he made thee Duke of York .
YORK : ' Twas my inheritance , as the earldom was .
EXETER : Thy father was a traitor to the crown .
WARWICK : Exeter , thou art a traitor to the crown In following this usurping Henry .
CLIFFORD : Whom should he follow but his natural king ?
WARWICK : True , Clifford ; and that 's Richard Duke of York .
KING HENRY VI : And shall I stand , and thou sit in my throne ?
YORK : It must and shall be so : content thyself .
WARWICK : Be Duke of Lancaster ; let him be king .
WESTMORELAND : He is both king and Duke of Lancaster ; And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain .
WARWICK : And Warwick shall disprove it . You forget That we are those which chased you from the field And slew your fathers , and with colours spread March 'd through the city to the palace gates .
NORTHUMBERLAND : Yes , Warwick , I remember it to my grief ; And , by his soul , thou and thy house shall rue it .
WESTMORELAND : Plantagenet , of thee and these thy sons , Thy kinsman and thy friends , I 'll have more lives Than drops of blood were in my father 's veins .
CLIFFORD : Urge it no more ; lest that , instead of words , I send thee , Warwick , such a messenger As shall revenge his death before I stir .
WARWICK : Poor Clifford ! how I scorn his worthless threats !
YORK : Will you we show our title to the crown ? If not , our swords shall plead it in the field .
KING HENRY VI : What title hast thou , traitor , to the crown ? Thy father was , as thou art , Duke of York ; Thy grandfather , Roger Mortimer , Earl of March : I am the son of Henry the Fifth , Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop And seized upon their towns and provinces .
WARWICK : Talk not of France , sith thou hast lost it all .
KING HENRY VI : The lord protector lost it , and not I : When I was crown 'd I was but nine months old .
RICHARD : You are old enough now , and yet , methinks , you lose . Father , tear the crown from the usurper 's head .
EDWARD : Sweet father , do so ; set it on your head .
MONTAGUE : Good brother , as thou lovest and honourest arms , Let 's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus .
RICHARD : Sound drums and trumpets , and the king will fly .
YORK : Sons , peace !
KING HENRY VI : Peace , thou ! and give King Henry leave to speak .
WARWICK : Plantagenet shall speak first : hear him , lords ; And be you silent and attentive too , For he that interrupts him shall not live .
KING HENRY VI : Think 'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne , Wherein my grandsire and my father sat ? No : first shall war unpeople this my realm ; Ay , and their colours , often borne in France , And now in England to our heart 's great sorrow , Shall be my winding-sheet . Why faint you , lords ? My title 's good , and better far than his .
WARWICK : Prove it , Henry , and thou shalt be king .
KING HENRY VI : Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown .
YORK : ' Twas by rebellion against his king .
KING HENRY VI : I know not what to say ; my title 's weak.-- Tell me , may not a king adopt an heir ?
YORK : What then ?
