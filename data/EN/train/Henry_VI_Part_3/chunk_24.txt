BONA : Tell him , in hope he 'll prove a widower shortly , I 'll wear the willow garland for his sake .
QUEEN MARGARET : Tell him , my mourning weeds are laid aside , And I am ready to put armour on .
WARWICK : Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong , And therefore I 'll uncrown him ere 't be long . There 's thy reward : be gone . Exit Post
KING LEWIS XI : But , Warwick , Thou and Oxford , with five thousand men , Shall cross the seas , and bid false Edward battle ; And , as occasion serves , this noble queen And prince shall follow with a fresh supply . Yet , ere thou go , but answer me one doubt , What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty ?
WARWICK : This shall assure my constant loyalty , That if our queen and this young prince agree , I 'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands .
QUEEN MARGARET : Yes , I agree , and thank you for your motion . Son Edward , she is fair and virtuous , Therefore delay not , give thy hand to Warwick ; And , with thy hand , thy faith irrevocable , That only Warwick 's daughter shall be thine .
PRINCE EDWARD : Yes , I accept her , for she well deserves it ; And here , to pledge my vow , I give my hand . He gives his hand to WARWICK
KING LEWIS XI : Why stay we now ? These soldiers shall be levied , And thou , Lord Bourbon , our high admiral , Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet . I long till Edward fall by war 's mischance , For mocking marriage with a dame of France .
WARWICK : I came from Edward as ambassador , But I return his sworn and mortal foe : Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me , But dreadful war shall answer his demand . Had he none else to make a stale but me ? Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow . I was the chief that raised him to the crown , And I 'll be chief to bring him down again : Not that I pity Henry 's misery , But seek revenge on Edward 's mockery . Exit Enter GLOUCESTER , CLARENCE , SOMERSET , and MONTAGUE
GLOUCESTER : Now tell me , brother Clarence , what think you Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey ? Hath not our brother made a worthy choice ?
CLARENCE : Alas , you know , ' tis far from hence to France ; How could he stay till Warwick made return ?
SOMERSET : My lords , forbear this talk ; here comes the king .
GLOUCESTER : And his well-chosen bride .
CLARENCE : I mind to tell him plainly what I think . Flourish . Enter KING EDWARD IV , attended ; QUEEN ELIZABETH , PEMBROKE , STAFFORD , HASTINGS , and others
KING EDWARD IV : Now , brother of Clarence , how like you our choice , That you stand pensive , as half malcontent ?
CLARENCE : As well as Lewis of France , or the Earl of Warwick , Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That they 'll take no offence at our abuse .
KING EDWARD IV : Suppose they take offence without a cause , They are but Lewis and Warwick : I am Edward , Your king and Warwick 's , and must have my will .
GLOUCESTER : And shall have your will , because our king : Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well .
KING EDWARD IV : Yea , brother Richard , are you offended too ?
GLOUCESTER : Not I : No , God forbid that I should wish them sever 'd Whom God hath join 'd together ; ay , and ' twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well together .
KING EDWARD IV : Setting your scorns and your mislike aside , Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and England 's queen . And you too , Somerset and Montague , Speak freely what you think .
