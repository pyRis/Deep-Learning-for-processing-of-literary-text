KING HENRY VI : I , Daedalus ; my poor boy , Icarus ; Thy father , Minos , that denied our course ; The sun that sear 'd the wings of my sweet boy Thy brother Edward , and thyself the sea Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life . Ah , kill me with thy weapon , not with words ! My breast can better brook thy dagger 's point Than can my ears that tragic history . But wherefore dost thou come ? is 't for my life ?
GLOUCESTER : Think 'st thou I am an executioner ?
KING HENRY VI : A persecutor , I am sure , thou art : If murdering innocents be executing , Why , then thou art an executioner .
GLOUCESTER : Thy son I kill 'd for his presumption .
KING HENRY VI : Hadst thou been kill 'd when first thou didst presume , Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine . And thus I prophesy , that many a thousand , Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear , And many an old man 's sigh and many a widow 's , And many an orphan 's water-standing eye-- Men for their sons , wives for their husbands , And orphans for their parents timeless death-- Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born . The owl shriek 'd at thy birth , --an evil sign ; The night-crow cried , aboding luckless time ; Dogs howl 'd , and hideous tempest shook down trees ; The raven rook 'd her on the chimney 's top , And chattering pies in dismal discords sung . Thy mother felt more than a mother 's pain , And , yet brought forth less than a mother 's hope , To wit , an indigested and deformed lump , Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree . Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born , To signify thou camest to bite the world : And , if the rest be true which I have heard , Thou camest--
GLOUCESTER : I 'll hear no more : die , prophet in thy speech : Stabs him For this amongst the rest , was I ordain 'd .
KING HENRY VI : Ay , and for much more slaughter after this . God forgive my sins , and pardon thee ! Dies
