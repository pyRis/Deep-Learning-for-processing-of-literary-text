First Keeper : We are true subjects to the king , King Edward .
KING HENRY VI : So would you be again to Henry , If he were seated as King Edward is .
First Keeper : We charge you , in God 's name , and the king 's , To go with us unto the officers .
KING HENRY VI : In God 's name , lead ; your king 's name be obey 'd : And what God will , that let your king perform ; And what he will , I humbly yield unto . Enter KING EDWARD IV , GLOUCESTER , CLARENCE , and LADY GREY
KING EDWARD IV : Brother of Gloucester , at Saint Alban 's field This lady 's husband , Sir Richard Grey , was slain , His lands then seized on by the conqueror : Her suit is now to repossess those lands ; Which we in justice cannot well deny , Because in quarrel of the house of York The worthy gentleman did lose his life .
GLOUCESTER : Your highness shall do well to grant her suit ; It were dishonour to deny it her .
KING EDWARD IV : It were no less ; but yet I 'll make a pause .
GLOUCESTER : Yea , is it so ? I see the lady hath a thing to grant , Before the king will grant her humble suit .
CLARENCE : He knows the game : how true he keeps the wind !
GLOUCESTER : Silence !
KING EDWARD IV : Widow , we will consider of your suit ; And come some other time to know our mind .
LADY GREY : Right gracious lord , I cannot brook delay : May it please your highness to resolve me now ; And what your pleasure is , shall satisfy me .
GLOUCESTER : Ay , widow ? then I 'll warrant you all your lands , An if what pleases him shall pleasure you . Fight closer , or , good faith , you 'll catch a blow .
CLARENCE : I fear her not , unless she chance to fall .
GLOUCESTER : God forbid that ! for he 'll take vantages .
KING EDWARD IV : How many children hast thou , widow ? tell me .
CLARENCE : I think he means to beg a child of her .
GLOUCESTER : Nay , whip me then : he 'll rather give her two .
LADY GREY : Three , my most gracious lord .
GLOUCESTER : You shall have four , if you 'll be ruled by him .
KING EDWARD IV : ' Twere pity they should lose their father 's lands .
LADY GREY : Be pitiful , dread lord , and grant it then .
KING EDWARD IV : Lords , give us leave : I 'll try this widow 's wit .
GLOUCESTER : Ay , good leave have you ; for you will have leave , Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch . GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
KING EDWARD IV : Now tell me , madam , do you love your children ?
LADY GREY : Ay , full as dearly as I love myself .
KING EDWARD IV : And would you not do much to do them good ?
LADY GREY : To do them good , I would sustain some harm .
KING EDWARD IV : Then get your husband 's lands , to do them good .
LADY GREY : Therefore I came unto your majesty .
KING EDWARD IV : I 'll tell you how these lands are to be got .
LADY GREY : So shall you bind me to your highness ' service .
KING EDWARD IV : What service wilt thou do me , if I give them ?
LADY GREY : What you command , that rests in me to do .
KING EDWARD IV : But you will take exceptions to my boon .
LADY GREY : No , gracious lord , except I cannot do it .
KING EDWARD IV : Ay , but thou canst do what I mean to ask .
LADY GREY : Why , then I will do what your grace commands .
GLOUCESTER : He plies her hard ; and much rain wears the marble .
CLARENCE : As red as fire ! nay , then her wax must melt .
