PLANTAGENET : Then say at once if I maintain 'd the truth ; Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error ?
SUFFOLK : Faith , I have been a truant in the law , And never yet could frame my will to it ; And therefore frame the law unto my will .
SOMERSET : Judge you , my Lord of Warwick , then , between us .
WARWICK : Between two hawks , which flies the higher pitch ; Between two dogs , which hath the deeper mouth ; Between two blades , which bears the better temper : Between two horses , which doth bear him best ; Between two girls , which hath the merriest eye ; I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement ; But in these nice sharp quillets of the law , Good faith , I am no wiser than a daw . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Tut , tut , here is a mannerly forbearance : The truth appears so naked on my side That any purblind eye may find it out .
SOMERSET : And on my side it is so well apparell 'd , So clear , so shining and so evident That it will glimmer through a blind man 's eye . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak , In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts : Let him that is a true-born gentleman And stands upon the honour of his birth , If he suppose that I have pleaded truth , From off this brier pluck a white rose with me .
SOMERSET : Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer , But dare maintain the party of the truth , Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me .
WARWICK : I love no colours , and without all colour Of base insinuating flattery I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet .
SUFFOLK : I pluck this red rose with young Somerset And say withal I think he held the right .
VERNON : Stay , lords and gentlemen , and pluck no more , Till you conclude that he upon whose side The fewest roses are cropp 'd from the tree Shall yield the other in the right opinion .
SOMERSET : Good Master Vernon , it is well objected : If I have fewest , I subscribe in silence . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : And I.
VERNON : Then for the truth and plainness of the case . I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here , Giving my verdict on the white rose side .
SOMERSET : Prick not your finger as you pluck it off , Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red And fall on my side so , against your will .
VERNON : If I my lord , for my opinion bleed , Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt And keep me on the side where still I am .
SOMERSET : Well , well , come on : who else ?
Lawyer : Unless my study and my books be false , The argument you held was wrong in you : To SOMERSET In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Now , Somerset , where is your argument ?
SOMERSET : Here in my scabbard , meditating that Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses ; For pale they look with fear , as witnessing The truth on our side .
SOMERSET : No , Plantagenet , ' Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses , And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Hath not thy rose a canker , Somerset ?
SOMERSET : Hath not thy rose a thorn , Plantagenet ? RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Ay , sharp and piercing , to maintain his truth ; Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood .
SOMERSET : Well , I 'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses , That shall maintain what I have said is true , Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Now , by this maiden blossom in my hand , I scorn thee and thy fashion , peevish boy .
SUFFOLK : Turn not thy scorns this way , Plantagenet . RICHARD
PLANTAGENET : Proud Pole , I will , and scorn both him and thee .
