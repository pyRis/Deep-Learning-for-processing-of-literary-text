PLANTAGENET : And peace , no war , befall thy parting soul ! In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage And like a hermit overpass 'd thy days . Well , I will lock his counsel in my breast ; And what I do imagine let that rest . Keepers , convey him hence , and I myself Will see his burial better than his life . Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer , Choked with ambition of the meaner sort : And for those wrongs , those bitter injuries , Which Somerset hath offer 'd to my house : I doubt not but with honour to redress ; And therefore haste I to the parliament , Either to be restored to my blood , Or make my ill the advantage of my good . Exit Flourish . Enter KING HENRY VI , EXETER , GLOUCESTER , WARWICK , SOMERSET , and SUFFOLK ; the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER , RICHARD PLANTAGENET , and others . GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill ; BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it , and tears it BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER : Comest thou with deep premeditated lines , With written pamphlets studiously devised , Humphrey of Gloucester ? If thou canst accuse , Or aught intend 'st to lay unto my charge , Do it without invention , suddenly ; As I with sudden and extemporal speech Purpose to answer what thou canst object .
GLOUCESTER : Presumptuous priest ! this place commands my patience , Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour 'd me . Think not , although in writing I preferr 'd The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes , That therefore I have forged , or am not able Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen : No , prelate ; such is thy audacious wickedness , Thy lewd , pestiferous and dissentious pranks , As very infants prattle of thy pride . Thou art a most pernicious usurer , Forward by nature , enemy to peace ; Lascivious , wanton , more than well beseems A man of thy profession and degree ; And for thy treachery , what 's more manifest ? In that thou laid 'st a trap to take my life , As well at London bridge as at the Tower . Beside , I fear me , if thy thoughts were sifted , The king , thy sovereign , is not quite exempt From envious malice of thy swelling heart . BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER : Gloucester , I do defy thee . Lords , vouchsafe To give me hearing what I shall reply . If I were covetous , ambitious or perverse , As he will have me , how am I so poor ? Or how haps it I seek not to advance Or raise myself , but keep my wonted calling ? And for dissension , who preferreth peace More than I do ? --except I be provoked . No , my good lords , it is not that offends ; It is not that that hath incensed the duke : It is , because no one should sway but he ; No one but he should be about the king ; And that engenders thunder in his breast And makes him roar these accusations forth . But he shall know I am as good--
GLOUCESTER : As good ! Thou bastard of my grandfather ! BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER : Ay , lordly sir ; for what are you , I pray , But one imperious in another 's throne ?
GLOUCESTER : Am I not protector , saucy priest ? BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER : And am not I a prelate of the church ?
GLOUCESTER : Yes , as an outlaw in a castle keeps And useth it to patronage his theft . BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER : Unreverent Gloster !
GLOUCESTER : Thou art reverent Touching thy spiritual function , not thy life . BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER : Rome shall remedy this .
WARWICK : Roam thither , then .
SOMERSET : My lord , it were your duty to forbear .
WARWICK : Ay , see the bishop be not overborne .
SOMERSET : Methinks my lord should be religious And know the office that belongs to such .
WARWICK : Methinks his lordship should be humbler ; it fitteth not a prelate so to plead .
SOMERSET : Yes , when his holy state is touch 'd so near .
