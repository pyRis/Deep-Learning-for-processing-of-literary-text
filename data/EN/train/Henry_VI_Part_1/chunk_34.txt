KING HENRY VI : Whether it be through force of your report , My noble Lord of Suffolk , or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love , I cannot tell ; but this I am assured , I feel such sharp dissension in my breast , Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear , As I am sick with working of my thoughts . Take , therefore , shipping ; post , my lord , to France ; Agree to any covenants , and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crown 'd King Henry 's faithful and anointed queen : For your expenses and sufficient charge , Among the people gather up a tenth . Be gone , I say ; for , till you do return , I rest perplexed with a thousand cares . And you , good uncle , banish all offence : If you do censure me by what you were , Not what you are , I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will . And so , conduct me where , from company , I may revolve and ruminate my grief . Exit
GLOUCESTER : Ay , grief , I fear me , both at first and last .
