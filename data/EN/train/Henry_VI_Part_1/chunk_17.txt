JOAN LA PUCELLE : Paysans , pauvres gens de France ; Poor market folks that come to sell their corn .
Watch : Enter , go in ; the market bell is rung .
JOAN LA PUCELLE : Now , Rouen , I 'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground . Enter CHARLES , the BASTARD OF ORLEANS , ALENCON , REIGNIER , and forces
CHARLES : Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem ! And once again we 'll sleep secure in Rouen .
BASTARD OF ORLEANS : Here enter 'd Pucelle and her practisants ; Now she is there , how will she specify Where is the best and safest passage in ?
REIGNIER : By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower ; Which , once discern 'd , shows that her meaning is , No way to that , for weakness , which she enter 'd . Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top , thrusting out a torch burning
JOAN LA PUCELLE : Behold , this is the happy wedding torch That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen , But burning fatal to the Talbotites ! Exit
BASTARD OF ORLEANS : See , noble Charles , the beacon of our friend ; The burning torch in yonder turret stands .
CHARLES : Now shine it like a comet of revenge , A prophet to the fall of all our foes !
REIGNIER : Defer no time , delays have dangerous ends ; Enter , and cry ' The Dauphin ! ' presently , And then do execution on the watch . An alarum . Enter TALBOT in an excursion
TALBOT : France , thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears , If Talbot but survive thy treachery . Pucelle , that witch , that damned sorceress , Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares , That hardly we escaped the pride of France . Exit An alarum : excursions . BEDFORD , brought in sick in a chair . Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without : within JOAN LA PUCELLE , CHARLES , BASTARD OF ORLEANS , ALENCON , and REIGNIER , on the walls
JOAN LA PUCELLE : Good morrow , gallants ! want ye corn for bread ? I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast Before he 'll buy again at such a rate : ' Twas full of darnel ; do you like the taste ?
BURGUNDY : Scoff on , vile fiend and shameless courtezan ! I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own And make thee curse the harvest of that corn .
CHARLES : Your grace may starve perhaps before that time .
BEDFORD : O , let no words , but deeds , revenge this treason !
JOAN LA PUCELLE : What will you do , good grey-beard ? break a lance , And run a tilt at death within a chair ?
TALBOT : Foul fiend of France , and hag of all despite , Encompass 'd with thy lustful paramours ! Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age And twit with cowardice a man half dead ? Damsel , I 'll have a bout with you again , Or else let Talbot perish with this shame .
JOAN LA PUCELLE : Are ye so hot , sir ? yet , Pucelle , hold thy peace ; If Talbot do but thunder , rain will follow . The English whisper together in council God speed the parliament ! who shall be the speaker ?
TALBOT : Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field ?
JOAN LA PUCELLE : Belike your lordship takes us then for fools , To try if that our own be ours or no .
TALBOT : I speak not to that railing Hecate , But unto thee , Alencon , and the rest ; Will ye , like soldiers , come and fight it out ?
ALENCON : Signior , no .
TALBOT : Signior , hang ! base muleters of France ! Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls And dare not take up arms like gentlemen .
JOAN LA PUCELLE : Away , captains ! let 's get us from the walls ; For Talbot means no goodness by his looks . God be wi ' you , my lord ! we came but to tell you That we are here .
