HECTOR : Stand , stand , thou Greek ; thou art a goodly mark : No ? wilt thou not ? I like thy armour well ; I 'll frush it and unlock the rivets all , But I 'll be master of it : wilt thou not , beast , abide ? Why , then fly on , I 'll hunt thee for thy hide . Enter ACHILLES , with Myrmidons
ACHILLES : Come here about me , you my Myrmidons ; Mark what I say . Attend me where I wheel : Strike not a stroke , but keep yourselves in breath : And when I have the bloody Hector found , Empale him with your weapons round about ; In fellest manner execute your aims . Follow me , sirs , and my proceedings eye : It is decreed Hector the great must die . Enter MENELAUS and PARIS , fighting : then THERSITES
THERSITES : The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it . Now , bull ! now , dog ! ' Loo , Paris , ' loo ! now my double- henned sparrow ! ' loo , Paris , ' loo ! The bull has the game : ware horns , ho ! Enter MARGARELON
MARGARELON : Turn , slave , and fight .
THERSITES : What art thou ?
MARGARELON : A bastard son of Priam 's .
THERSITES : I am a bastard too ; I love bastards : I am a bastard begot , bastard instructed , bastard in mind , bastard in valour , in every thing illegitimate . One bear will not bite another , and wherefore should one bastard ? Take heed , the quarrel 's most ominous to us : if the son of a whore fight for a whore , he tempts judgment : farewell , bastard . Exit
MARGARELON : The devil take thee , coward ! Exit Enter HECTOR
HECTOR : Most putrefied core , so fair without , Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life . Now is my day 's work done ; I 'll take good breath : Rest , sword ; thou hast thy fill of blood and death . Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons
ACHILLES : Look , Hector , how the sun begins to set ; How ugly night comes breathing at his heels : Even with the vail and darking of the sun , To close the day up , Hector 's life is done .
HECTOR : I am unarm 'd ; forego this vantage , Greek .
ACHILLES : Strike , fellows , strike ; this is the man I seek . HECTOR falls So , Ilion , fall thou next ! now , Troy , sink down ! Here lies thy heart , thy sinews , and thy bone . On , Myrmidons , and cry you all amain , ' Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain . ' A retreat sounded Hark ! a retire upon our Grecian part .
MYRMIDONS : The Trojan trumpets sound the like , my lord .
ACHILLES : The dragon wing of night o 'erspreads the earth , And , stickler-like , the armies separates . My half-supp 'd sword , that frankly would have fed , Pleased with this dainty bait , thus goes to bed . Sheathes his sword Come , tie his body to my horse 's tail ; Along the field I will the Trojan trail . Enter AGAMEMNON , AJAX , MENELAUS , NESTOR , DIOMEDES , and others , marching . Shouts within
AGAMEMNON : Hark ! hark ! what shout is that ?
NESTOR : Peace , drums ! Within Achilles ! Achilles ! Hector 's slain ! Achilles .
DIOMEDES : The bruit is , Hector 's slain , and by Achilles .
AJAX : If it be so , yet bragless let it be ; Great Hector was a man as good as he .
AGAMEMNON : March patiently along : let one be sent To pray Achilles see us at our tent . If in his death the gods have us befriended , Great Troy is ours , and our sharp wars are ended . Enter AENEAS and Trojans
AENEAS : Stand , ho ! yet are we masters of the field : Never go home ; here starve we out the night . Enter TROILUS
TROILUS : Hector is slain .
ALL : Hector ! the gods forbid !
