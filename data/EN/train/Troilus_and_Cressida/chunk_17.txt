ULYSSES : A ' would have ten shares .
AJAX : I will knead him ; I 'll make him supple .
NESTOR : He 's not yet through warm : force him with praises : pour in , pour in ; his ambition is dry .
ULYSSES : My lord , you feed too much on this dislike .
NESTOR : Our noble general , do not do so .
DIOMEDES : You must prepare to fight without Achilles .
ULYSSES : Why , ' tis this naming of him does him harm . Here is a man--but ' tis before his face ; I will be silent .
NESTOR : Wherefore should you so ? He is not emulous , as Achilles is .
ULYSSES : Know the whole world , he is as valiant .
AJAX : A whoreson dog , that shall pelter thus with us ! Would he were a Trojan !
NESTOR : What a vice were it in Ajax now , --
ULYSSES : If he were proud , --
DIOMEDES : Or covetous of praise , --
ULYSSES : Ay , or surly borne , --
DIOMEDES : Or strange , or self-affected !
ULYSSES : Thank the heavens , lord , thou art of sweet composure ; Praise him that got thee , she that gave thee suck : Famed be thy tutor , and thy parts of nature Thrice famed , beyond all erudition : But he that disciplined thy arms to fight , Let Mars divide eternity in twain , And give him half : and , for thy vigour , Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield To sinewy Ajax . I will not praise thy wisdom , Which , like a bourn , a pale , a shore , confines Thy spacious and dilated parts : here 's Nestor ; Instructed by the antiquary times , He must , he is , he cannot but be wise : Put pardon , father Nestor , were your days As green as Ajax ' and your brain so temper 'd , You should not have the eminence of him , But be as Ajax .
AJAX : Shall I call you father ?
NESTOR : Ay , my good son .
DIOMEDES : Be ruled by him , Lord Ajax .
ULYSSES : There is no tarrying here ; the hart Achilles Keeps thicket . Please it our great general To call together all his state of war ; Fresh kings are come to Troy : to-morrow We must with all our main of power stand fast : And here 's a lord , --come knights from east to west , And cull their flower , Ajax shall cope the best .
AGAMEMNON : Go we to council . Let Achilles sleep : Light boats sail swift , though greater hulks draw deep . Enter a Servant and PANDARUS
PANDARUS : Friend , you ! pray you , a word : do not you follow the young Lord Paris ?
Servant : Ay , sir , when he goes before me .
PANDARUS : You depend upon him , I mean ?
Servant : Sir , I do depend upon the lord .
PANDARUS : You depend upon a noble gentleman ; I must needs praise him .
Servant : The lord be praised !
PANDARUS : You know me , do you not ?
Servant : Faith , sir , superficially .
PANDARUS : Friend , know me better ; I am the Lord Pandarus .
Servant : I hope I shall know your honour better .
PANDARUS : I do desire it .
Servant : You are in the state of grace .
PANDARUS : Grace ! not so , friend : honour and lordship are my titles . Music within What music is this ?
Servant : I do but partly know , sir : it is music in parts .
PANDARUS : Know you the musicians ?
Servant : Wholly , sir .
PANDARUS : Who play they to ?
Servant : To the hearers , sir .
PANDARUS : At whose pleasure , friend
Servant : At mine , sir , and theirs that love music .
PANDARUS : Command , I mean , friend .
Servant : Who shall I command , sir ?
PANDARUS : Friend , we understand not one another : I am too courtly and thou art too cunning . At whose request do these men play ?
