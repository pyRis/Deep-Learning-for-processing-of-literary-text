PANDARUS : Who , my cousin Cressida ?
Servant : No , sir , Helen : could you not find out that by her attributes ?
PANDARUS : It should seem , fellow , that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida . I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus : I will make a complimental assault upon him , for my business seethes .
Servant : Sodden business ! there 's a stewed phrase indeed ! Enter PARIS and HELEN , attended
PANDARUS : Fair be to you , my lord , and to all this fair company ! fair desires , in all fair measure , fairly guide them ! especially to you , fair queen ! fair thoughts be your fair pillow !
HELEN : Dear lord , you are full of fair words .
PANDARUS : You speak your fair pleasure , sweet queen . Fair prince , here is good broken music .
PARIS : You have broke it , cousin : and , by my life , you shall make it whole again ; you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance . Nell , he is full of harmony .
PANDARUS : Truly , lady , no .
HELEN : O , sir , --
PANDARUS : Rude , in sooth ; in good sooth , very rude .
PARIS : Well said , my lord ! well , you say so in fits .
PANDARUS : I have business to my lord , dear queen . My lord , will you vouchsafe me a word ?
HELEN : Nay , this shall not hedge us out : we 'll hear you sing , certainly .
PANDARUS : Well , sweet queen. you are pleasant with me . But , marry , thus , my lord : my dear lord and most esteemed friend , your brother Troilus , --
HELEN : My Lord Pandarus ; honey-sweet lord , --
PANDARUS : Go to , sweet queen , to go : --commends himself most affectionately to you , --
HELEN : You shall not bob us out of our melody : if you do , our melancholy upon your head !
PANDARUS : Sweet queen , sweet queen ! that 's a sweet queen , i ' faith .
HELEN : And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence .
PANDARUS : Nay , that shall not serve your turn ; that shall not , in truth , la . Nay , I care not for such words ; no , no . And , my lord , he desires you , that if the king call for him at supper , you will make his excuse .
HELEN : My Lord Pandarus , --
PANDARUS : What says my sweet queen , my very very sweet queen ?
PARIS : What exploit 's in hand ? where sups he to-night ?
HELEN : Nay , but , my lord , --
PANDARUS : What says my sweet queen ? My cousin will fall out with you . You must not know where he sups .
PARIS : I 'll lay my life , with my disposer Cressida .
PANDARUS : No , no , no such matter ; you are wide : come , your disposer is sick .
PARIS : Well , I 'll make excuse .
PANDARUS : Ay , good my lord . Why should you say Cressida ? no , your poor disposer 's sick .
PARIS : I spy .
PANDARUS : You spy ! what do you spy ? Come , give me an instrument . Now , sweet queen .
HELEN : Why , this is kindly done .
PANDARUS : My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have , sweet queen .
HELEN : She shall have it , my lord , if it be not my lord Paris .
PANDARUS : He ! no , she 'll none of him ; they two are twain .
HELEN : Falling in , after falling out , may make them three .
PANDARUS : Come , come , I 'll hear no more of this ; I 'll sing you a song now .
HELEN : Ay , ay , prithee now . By my troth , sweet lord , thou hast a fine forehead .
PANDARUS : Ay , you may , you may .
