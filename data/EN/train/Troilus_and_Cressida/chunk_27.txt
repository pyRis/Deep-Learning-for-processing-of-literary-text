PARIS : You are too bitter to your countrywoman .
DIOMEDES : She 's bitter to her country : hear me , Paris : For every false drop in her bawdy veins A Grecian 's life hath sunk ; for every scruple Of her contaminated carrion weight , A Trojan hath been slain : since she could speak , She hath not given so many good words breath As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer 'd death .
PARIS : Fair Diomed , you do as chapmen do , Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy : But we in silence hold this virtue well , We 'll but commend what we intend to sell . Here lies our way . Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA
TROILUS : Dear , trouble not yourself : the morn is cold .
CRESSIDA : Then , sweet my lord , I 'll call mine uncle down ; He shall unbolt the gates .
TROILUS : Trouble him not ; To bed , to bed : sleep kill those pretty eyes , And give as soft attachment to thy senses As infants ' empty of all thought !
CRESSIDA : Good morrow , then .
TROILUS : I prithee now , to bed .
CRESSIDA : Are you a-weary of me ?
TROILUS : O Cressida ! but that the busy day , Waked by the lark , hath roused the ribald crows , And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer , I would not from thee .
CRESSIDA : Night hath been too brief .
TROILUS : Beshrew the witch ! with venomous wights she stays As tediously as hell , but flies the grasps of love With wings more momentary-swift than thought . You will catch cold , and curse me .
CRESSIDA : Prithee , tarry : You men will never tarry . O foolish Cressid ! I might have still held off , And then you would have tarried . Hark ! there 's one up .
PANDARUS : What , ' s all the doors open here ?
TROILUS : It is your uncle .
CRESSIDA : A pestilence on him ! now will he be mocking : I shall have such a life ! Enter PANDARUS
PANDARUS : How now , how now ! how go maidenheads ? Here , you maid ! where 's my cousin Cressid ?
CRESSIDA : Go hang yourself , you naughty mocking uncle ! You bring me to do , and then you flout me too .
PANDARUS : To do what ? to do what ? let her say what : what have I brought you to do ?
CRESSIDA : Come , come , beshrew your heart ! you 'll ne 'er be good , Nor suffer others .
PANDARUS : Ha ! ha ! Alas , poor wretch ! ah , poor capocchia ! hast not slept to-night ? would he not , a naughty man , let it sleep ? a bugbear take him !
CRESSIDA : Did not I tell you ? Would he were knock 'd i ' the head ! Knocking within Who 's that at door ? good uncle , go and see . My lord , come you again into my chamber : You smile and mock me , as if I meant naughtily .
TROILUS : Ha , ha !
CRESSIDA : Come , you are deceived , I think of no such thing . Knocking within How earnestly they knock ! Pray you , come in : I would not for half Troy have you seen here .
PANDARUS : Who 's there ? what 's the matter ? will you beat down the door ? How now ! what 's the matter ? Enter AENEAS
AENEAS : Good morrow , lord , good morrow .
PANDARUS : Who 's there ? my Lord AEneas ! By my troth , I knew you not : what news with you so early ?
AENEAS : Is not Prince Troilus here ?
PANDARUS : Here ! what should he do here ?
AENEAS : Come , he is here , my lord ; do not deny him : It doth import him much to speak with me .
PANDARUS : Is he here , say you ? ' tis more than I know , I 'll be sworn : for my own part , I came in late . What should he do here ?
