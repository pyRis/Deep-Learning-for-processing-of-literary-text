CRESSIDA : Indeed , a tapster 's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total .
PANDARUS : Why , he is very young : and yet will he , within three pound , lift as much as his brother Hector .
CRESSIDA : Is he so young a man and so old a lifter ?
PANDARUS : But to prove to you that Helen loves him : she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
CRESSIDA : Juno have mercy ! how came it cloven ?
PANDARUS : Why , you know ' tis dimpled : I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia .
CRESSIDA : O , he smiles valiantly .
PANDARUS : Does he not ?
CRESSIDA : O yes , an ' twere a cloud in autumn .
PANDARUS : Why , go to , then : but to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus , --
CRESSIDA : Troilus will stand to the proof , if you 'll prove it so .
PANDARUS : Troilus ! why , he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg .
CRESSIDA : If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head , you would eat chickens i ' the shell .
PANDARUS : I cannot choose but laugh , to think how she tickled his chin : indeed , she has a marvellous white hand , I must needs confess , --
CRESSIDA : Without the rack .
PANDARUS : And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin .
CRESSIDA : Alas , poor chin ! many a wart is richer .
PANDARUS : But there was such laughing ! Queen Hecuba laughed that her eyes ran o 'er .
CRESSIDA : With mill-stones .
PANDARUS : And Cassandra laughed .
CRESSIDA : But there was more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes : did her eyes run o 'er too ?
PANDARUS : And Hector laughed .
CRESSIDA : At what was all this laughing ?
PANDARUS : Marry , at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus ' chin .
CRESSIDA : An 't had been a green hair , I should have laughed too .
PANDARUS : They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer .
CRESSIDA : What was his answer ?
PANDARUS : Quoth she , ' Here 's but two and fifty hairs on your chin , and one of them is white .
CRESSIDA : This is her question .
PANDARUS : That 's true ; make no question of that . ' Two and fifty hairs ' quoth he , ' and one white : that white hair is my father , and all the rest are his sons . ' ' Jupiter ! ' quoth she , ' which of these hairs is Paris , my husband ? ' The forked one , ' quoth he , ' pluck 't out , and give it him . ' But there was such laughing ! and Helen so blushed , an Paris so chafed , and all the rest so laughed , that it passed .
CRESSIDA : So let it now ; for it has been while going by .
PANDARUS : Well , cousin . I told you a thing yesterday ; think on 't .
CRESSIDA : So I do .
PANDARUS : I 'll be sworn ' tis true ; he will weep you , an ' twere a man born in April .
CRESSIDA : And I 'll spring up in his tears , an ' twere a nettle against May . A retreat sounded
PANDARUS : Hark ! they are coming from the field : shall we stand up here , and see them as they pass toward Ilium ? good niece , do , sweet niece Cressida .
CRESSIDA : At your pleasure .
PANDARUS : Here , here , here 's an excellent place ; here we may see most bravely : I 'll tell you them all by their names as they pass by ; but mark Troilus above the rest .
CRESSIDA : Speak not so loud . AENEAS passes
PANDARUS : That 's AEneas : is not that a brave man ? he 's one of the flowers of Troy , I can tell you : but mark Troilus ; you shall see anon . ANTENOR passes
CRESSIDA : Who 's that ?
