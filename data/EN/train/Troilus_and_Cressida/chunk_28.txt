TROILUS : How now ! what 's the matter ?
AENEAS : My lord , I scarce have leisure to salute you , My matter is so rash : there is at hand Paris your brother , and Deiphobus , The Grecian Diomed , and our Antenor Deliver 'd to us ; and for him forthwith , Ere the first sacrifice , within this hour , We must give up to Diomedes ' hand The Lady Cressida .
TROILUS : Is it so concluded ?
AENEAS : By Priam and the general state of Troy : They are at hand and ready to effect it .
TROILUS : How my achievements mock me ! I will go meet them : and , my Lord AEneas , We met by chance ; you did not find me here .
AENEAS : Good , good , my lord ; the secrets of nature Have not more gift in taciturnity .
PANDARUS : Is 't possible ? no sooner got but lost ? The devil take Antenor ! the young prince will go mad : a plague upon Antenor ! I would they had broke ' s neck ! Re-enter CRESSIDA
CRESSIDA : How now ! what 's the matter ? who was here ?
PANDARUS : Ah , ah !
CRESSIDA : Why sigh you so profoundly ? where 's my lord ? gone ! Tell me , sweet uncle , what 's the matter ?
PANDARUS : Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above !
CRESSIDA : O the gods ! what 's the matter ?
PANDARUS : Prithee , get thee in : would thou hadst ne 'er been born ! I knew thou wouldst be his death . O , poor gentleman ! A plague upon Antenor !
CRESSIDA : Good uncle , I beseech you , on my knees ! beseech you , what 's the matter ?
PANDARUS : Thou must be gone , wench , thou must be gone ; thou art changed for Antenor : thou must to thy father , and be gone from Troilus : ' twill be his death ; ' twill be his bane ; he cannot bear it .
CRESSIDA : O you immortal gods ! I will not go .
PANDARUS : Thou must .
CRESSIDA : I will not , uncle : I have forgot my father ; I know no touch of consanguinity ; No kin no love , no blood , no soul so near me As the sweet Troilus . O you gods divine ! Make Cressid 's name the very crown of falsehood , If ever she leave Troilus ! Time , force , and death , Do to this body what extremes you can ; But the strong base and building of my love Is as the very centre of the earth , Drawing all things to it . I 'll go in and weep , --
PANDARUS : Do , do .
CRESSIDA : Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks , Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart With sounding Troilus . I will not go from Troy . Enter PARIS , TROILUS , AENEAS , DEIPHOBUS , ANTENOR , and DIOMEDES
PARIS : It is great morning , and the hour prefix 'd Of her delivery to this valiant Greek Comes fast upon . Good my brother Troilus , Tell you the lady what she is to do , And haste her to the purpose .
TROILUS : Walk into her house ; I 'll bring her to the Grecian presently : And to his hand when I deliver her , Think it an altar , and thy brother Troilus A priest there offering to it his own heart . Exit
PARIS : I know what ' tis to love ; And would , as I shall pity , I could help ! Please you walk in , my lords . Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA
PANDARUS : Be moderate , be moderate .
