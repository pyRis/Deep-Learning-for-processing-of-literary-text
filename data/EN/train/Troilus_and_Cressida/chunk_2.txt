CRESSIDA : But how should this man , that makes me smile , make Hector angry ?
ALEXANDER : They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and struck him down , the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking .
CRESSIDA : Who comes here ?
ALEXANDER : Madam , your uncle Pandarus . Enter PANDARUS
CRESSIDA : Hector 's a gallant man .
ALEXANDER : As may be in the world , lady .
PANDARUS : What 's that ? what 's that ?
CRESSIDA : Good morrow , uncle Pandarus .
PANDARUS : Good morrow , cousin Cressid : what do you talk of ? Good morrow , Alexander . How do you , cousin ? When were you at Ilium ?
CRESSIDA : This morning , uncle .
PANDARUS : What were you talking of when I came ? Was Hector armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium ? Helen was not up , was she ?
CRESSIDA : Hector was gone , but Helen was not up .
PANDARUS : Even so : Hector was stirring early .
CRESSIDA : That were we talking of , and of his anger .
PANDARUS : Was he angry ?
CRESSIDA : So he says here .
PANDARUS : True , he was so : I know the cause too : he 'll lay about him to-day , I can tell them that : and there 's Troilus will not come far behind him : let them take heed of Troilus , I can tell them that too .
CRESSIDA : What , is he angry too ?
PANDARUS : Who , Troilus ? Troilus is the better man of the two .
CRESSIDA : O Jupiter ! there 's no comparison .
PANDARUS : What , not between Troilus and Hector ? Do you know a man if you see him ?
CRESSIDA : Ay , if I ever saw him before and knew him .
PANDARUS : Well , I say Troilus is Troilus .
CRESSIDA : Then you say as I say ; for , I am sure , he is not Hector .
PANDARUS : No , nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees .
CRESSIDA : ' Tis just to each of them ; he is himself .
PANDARUS : Himself ! Alas , poor Troilus ! I would he were .
CRESSIDA : So he is .
PANDARUS : Condition , I had gone barefoot to India .
CRESSIDA : He is not Hector .
PANDARUS : Himself ! no , he 's not himself : would a ' were himself ! Well , the gods are above ; time must friend or end : well , Troilus , well : I would my heart were in her body . No , Hector is not a better man than Troilus .
CRESSIDA : Excuse me .
PANDARUS : He is elder .
CRESSIDA : Pardon me , pardon me .
PANDARUS : Th ' other 's not come to 't ; you shall tell me another tale , when th ' other 's come to 't . Hector shall not have his wit this year .
CRESSIDA : He shall not need it , if he have his own .
PANDARUS : Nor his qualities .
CRESSIDA : No matter .
PANDARUS : Nor his beauty .
CRESSIDA : ' Twould not become him ; his own 's better .
PANDARUS : You have no judgment , niece : Helen herself swore th ' other day , that Troilus , for a brown favour--for so ' tis , I must confess , -- not brown neither , --
CRESSIDA : No , but brown .
PANDARUS : ' Faith , to say truth , brown and not brown .
CRESSIDA : To say the truth , true and not true .
PANDARUS : She praised his complexion above Paris .
CRESSIDA : Why , Paris hath colour enough .
PANDARUS : So he has .
CRESSIDA : Then Troilus should have too much : if she praised him above , his complexion is higher than his ; he having colour enough , and the other higher , is too flaming a praise for a good complexion . I had as lief Helen 's golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose .
PANDARUS : I swear to you . I think Helen loves him better than Paris .
CRESSIDA : Then she 's a merry Greek indeed .
