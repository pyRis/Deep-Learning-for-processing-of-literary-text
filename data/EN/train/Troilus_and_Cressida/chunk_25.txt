ACHILLES : Shall Ajax fight with Hector ?
PATROCLUS : Ay , and perhaps receive much honour by him .
ACHILLES : I see my reputation is at stake My fame is shrewdly gored .
PATROCLUS : O , then , beware ; Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves : Omission to do what is necessary Seals a commission to a blank of danger ; And danger , like an ague , subtly taints Even then when we sit idly in the sun .
ACHILLES : Go call Thersites hither , sweet Patroclus : I 'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him To invite the Trojan lords after the combat To see us here unarm 'd : I have a woman 's longing , An appetite that I am sick withal , To see great Hector in his weeds of peace , To talk with him and to behold his visage , Even to my full of view . Enter THERSITES A labour saved !
THERSITES : A wonder !
ACHILLES : What ?
THERSITES : Ajax goes up and down the field , asking for himself .
ACHILLES : How so ?
THERSITES : He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector , and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing .
ACHILLES : How can that be ?
THERSITES : Why , he stalks up and down like a peacock , --a stride and a stand : ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning : bites his lip with a politic regard , as who should say ' There were wit in this head , an ' twould out ; ' and so there is , but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint , which will not show without knocking . The man 's undone forever ; for if Hector break not his neck i ' the combat , he 'll break ' t himself in vain-glory . He knows not me : I said ' Good morrow , Ajax ; ' and he replies ' Thanks , Agamemnon . ' What think you of this man that takes me for the general ? He 's grown a very land-fish , language-less , a monster . A plague of opinion ! a man may wear it on both sides , like a leather jerkin .
ACHILLES : Thou must be my ambassador to him , Thersites .
THERSITES : Who , I ? why , he 'll answer nobody ; he professes not answering : speaking is for beggars ; he wears his tongue in 's arms . I will put on his presence : let Patroclus make demands to me , you shall see the pageant of Ajax .
ACHILLES : To him , Patroclus ; tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmed to my tent , and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured captain-general of the Grecian army , Agamemnon , et cetera . Do this .
PATROCLUS : Jove bless great Ajax !
THERSITES : Hum !
PATROCLUS : I come from the worthy Achilles , --
THERSITES : Ha !
PATROCLUS : Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent , --
THERSITES : Hum !
PATROCLUS : And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon .
THERSITES : Agamemnon !
PATROCLUS : Ay , my lord .
THERSITES : Ha !
PATROCLUS : What say you to 't ?
THERSITES : God b ' wi ' you , with all my heart .
PATROCLUS : Your answer , sir .
THERSITES : If to-morrow be a fair day , by eleven o 'clock it will go one way or other : howsoever , he shall pay for me ere he has me .
PATROCLUS : Your answer , sir .
THERSITES : Fare you well , with all my heart .
ACHILLES : Why , but he is not in this tune , is he ?
THERSITES : No , but he 's out o ' tune thus . What music will be in him when Hector has knocked out his brains , I know not ; but , I am sure , none , unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on .
ACHILLES : Come , thou shalt bear a letter to him straight .
