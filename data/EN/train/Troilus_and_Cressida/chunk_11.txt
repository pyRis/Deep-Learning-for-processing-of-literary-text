ACHILLES : What ?
THERSITES : I say , this Ajax-- Ajax offers to beat him
ACHILLES : Nay , good Ajax .
THERSITES : Has not so much wit--
ACHILLES : Nay , I must hold you .
THERSITES : As will stop the eye of Helen 's needle , for whom he comes to fight .
ACHILLES : Peace , fool !
THERSITES : I would have peace and quietness , but the fool will not : he there : that he : look you there .
AJAX : O thou damned cur ! I shall--
ACHILLES : Will you set your wit to a fool 's ?
THERSITES : No , I warrant you ; for a fools will shame it .
PATROCLUS : Good words , Thersites .
ACHILLES : What 's the quarrel ?
AJAX : I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the proclamation , and he rails upon me .
THERSITES : I serve thee not .
AJAX : Well , go to , go to .
THERSITES : I serve here voluntarily .
ACHILLES : Your last service was sufferance , ' twas not voluntary : no man is beaten voluntary : Ajax was here the voluntary , and you as under an impress .
THERSITES : E 'en so ; a great deal of your wit , too , lies in your sinews , or else there be liars . Hector have a great catch , if he knock out either of your brains : a ' were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel .
ACHILLES : What , with me too , Thersites ?
THERSITES : There 's Ulysses and old Nestor , whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes , yoke you like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars .
ACHILLES : What , what ?
THERSITES : Yes , good sooth : to , Achilles ! to , Ajax ! to !
AJAX : I shall cut out your tongue .
THERSITES : ' Tis no matter ! I shall speak as much as thou afterwards .
PATROCLUS : No more words , Thersites ; peace !
THERSITES : I will hold my peace when Achilles ' brach bids me , shall I ?
ACHILLES : There 's for you , Patroclus .
THERSITES : I will see you hanged , like clotpoles , ere I come any more to your tents : I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools . Exit
PATROCLUS : A good riddance .
ACHILLES : Marry , this , sir , is proclaim 'd through all our host : That Hector , by the fifth hour of the sun , Will with a trumpet ' twixt our tents and Troy To-morrow morning call some knight to arms That hath a stomach ; and such a one that dare Maintain--I know not what : ' tis trash . Farewell .
AJAX : Farewell . Who shall answer him ?
ACHILLES : I know not : ' tis put to lottery ; otherwise He knew his man .
AJAX : O , meaning you . I will go learn more of it . Enter PRIAM , HECTOR , TROILUS , PARIS , and HELENUS
PRIAM : After so many hours , lives , speeches spent , Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks : ' Deliver Helen , and all damage else-- As honour , loss of time , travail , expense , Wounds , friends , and what else dear that is consumed In hot digestion of this cormorant war-- Shall be struck off . ' Hector , what say you to 't ?
