AENEAS : My lord , you do discomfort all the host !
TROILUS : You understand me not that tell me so : I do not speak of flight , of fear , of death , But dare all imminence that gods and men Address their dangers in . Hector is gone : Who shall tell Priam so , or Hecuba ? Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call 'd , Go in to Troy , and say there , Hector 's dead : There is a word will Priam turn to stone ; Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives , Cold statues of the youth , and , in a word , Scare Troy out of itself . But , march away : Hector is dead ; there is no more to say . Stay yet . You vile abominable tents , Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains , Let Titan rise as early as he dare , I 'll through and through you ! and , thou great-sized coward , No space of earth shall sunder our two hates : I 'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still , That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy 's thoughts . Strike a free march to Troy ! with comfort go : Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe . As TROILUS is going out , enter , from the other side , PANDARUS
PANDARUS : But hear you , hear you !
TROILUS : Hence , broker-lackey ! ignomy and shame Pursue thy life , and live aye with thy name ! Exit
