PANDARUS : Because she 's kin to me , therefore she 's not so fair as Helen : an she were not kin to me , she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday . But what care I ? I care not an she were a black-a-moor ; ' tis all one to me .
TROILUS : Say I she is not fair ?
PANDARUS : I do not care whether you do or no . She 's a fool to stay behind her father ; let her to the Greeks ; and so I 'll tell her the next time I see her : for my part , I 'll meddle nor make no more i ' the matter .
TROILUS : Pandarus , --
PANDARUS : Not I.
TROILUS : Sweet Pandarus , --
PANDARUS : Pray you , speak no more to me : I will leave all as I found it , and there an end . Exit PANDARUS . An alarum
TROILUS : Peace , you ungracious clamours ! peace , rude sounds ! Fools on both sides ! Helen must needs be fair , When with your blood you daily paint her thus . I cannot fight upon this argument ; It is too starved a subject for my sword . But Pandarus , --O gods , how do you plague me ! I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar ; And he 's as tetchy to be woo 'd to woo . As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit . Tell me , Apollo , for thy Daphne 's love , What Cressid is , what Pandar , and what we ? Her bed is India ; there she lies , a pearl : Between our Ilium and where she resides , Let it be call 'd the wild and wandering flood , Ourself the merchant , and this sailing Pandar Our doubtful hope , our convoy and our bark . Alarum . Enter AENEAS
AENEAS : How now , Prince Troilus ! wherefore not afield ?
TROILUS : Because not there : this woman 's answer sorts , For womanish it is to be from thence . What news , AEneas , from the field to-day ?
AENEAS : That Paris is returned home and hurt .
TROILUS : By whom , AEneas ?
AENEAS : Troilus , by Menelaus .
TROILUS : Let Paris bleed ; ' tis but a scar to scorn ; Paris is gored with Menelaus ' horn . Alarum
AENEAS : Hark , what good sport is out of town to-day !
TROILUS : Better at home , if ' would I might ' were ' may . ' But to the sport abroad : are you bound thither ?
AENEAS : In all swift haste .
TROILUS : Come , go we then together . Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER
CRESSIDA : Who were those went by ?
ALEXANDER : Queen Hecuba and Helen .
CRESSIDA : And whither go they ?
ALEXANDER : Up to the eastern tower , Whose height commands as subject all the vale , To see the battle . Hector , whose patience Is , as a virtue , fix 'd , to-day was moved : He chid Andromache and struck his armourer , And , like as there were husbandry in war , Before the sun rose he was harness 'd light , And to the field goes he ; where every flower Did , as a prophet , weep what it foresaw In Hector 's wrath .
CRESSIDA : What was his cause of anger ?
ALEXANDER : The noise goes , this : there is among the Greeks A lord of Trojan blood , nephew to Hector ; They call him Ajax .
CRESSIDA : Good ; and what of him ?
ALEXANDER : They say he is a very man per se , And stands alone .
CRESSIDA : So do all men , unless they are drunk , sick , or have no legs .
