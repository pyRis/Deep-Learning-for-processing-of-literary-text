DIOMEDES : But will you , then ?
CRESSIDA : In faith , I will , la ; never trust me else .
DIOMEDES : Give me some token for the surety of it .
CRESSIDA : I 'll fetch you one . Exit
ULYSSES : You have sworn patience .
TROILUS : Fear me not , sweet lord ; I will not be myself , nor have cognition Of what I feel : I am all patience . Re-enter CRESSIDA
THERSITES : Now the pledge ; now , now , now !
CRESSIDA : Here , Diomed , keep this sleeve .
TROILUS : O beauty ! where is thy faith ?
ULYSSES : My lord , --
TROILUS : I will be patient ; outwardly I will .
CRESSIDA : You look upon that sleeve ; behold it well . He loved me--O false wench ! --Give 't me again .
DIOMEDES : Whose was 't ?
CRESSIDA : It is no matter , now I have 't again . I will not meet with you to-morrow night : I prithee , Diomed , visit me no more .
THERSITES : Now she sharpens : well said , whetstone !
DIOMEDES : I shall have it .
CRESSIDA : What , this ?
DIOMEDES : Ay , that .
CRESSIDA : O , all you gods ! O pretty , pretty pledge ! Thy master now lies thinking in his bed Of thee and me , and sighs , and takes my glove , And gives memorial dainty kisses to it , As I kiss thee . Nay , do not snatch it from me ; He that takes that doth take my heart withal .
DIOMEDES : I had your heart before , this follows it .
TROILUS : I did swear patience .
CRESSIDA : You shall not have it , Diomed ; faith , you shall not ; I 'll give you something else .
DIOMEDES : I will have this : whose was it ?
CRESSIDA : It is no matter .
DIOMEDES : Come , tell me whose it was .
CRESSIDA : ' Twas one 's that loved me better than you will . But , now you have it , take it .
DIOMEDES : Whose was it ?
CRESSIDA : By all Diana 's waiting-women yond , And by herself , I will not tell you whose .
DIOMEDES : To-morrow will I wear it on my helm , And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it .
TROILUS : Wert thou the devil , and worest it on thy horn , It should be challenged .
CRESSIDA : Well , well , ' tis done , ' tis past : and yet it is not ; I will not keep my word .
DIOMEDES : Why , then , farewell ; Thou never shalt mock Diomed again .
CRESSIDA : You shall not go : one cannot speak a word , But it straight starts you .
DIOMEDES : I do not like this fooling .
THERSITES : Nor I , by Pluto : but that that likes not you pleases me best .
DIOMEDES : What , shall I come ? the hour ?
CRESSIDA : Ay , come : --O Jove ! --do come : --I shall be plagued .
DIOMEDES : Farewell till then .
CRESSIDA : Good night : I prithee , come . Exit DIOMEDES Troilus , farewell ! one eye yet looks on thee But with my heart the other eye doth see . Ah , poor our sex ! this fault in us I find , The error of our eye directs our mind : What error leads must err ; O , then conclude Minds sway 'd by eyes are full of turpitude . Exit
THERSITES : A proof of strength she could not publish more , Unless she said ' My mind is now turn 'd whore . ' 
ULYSSES : All 's done , my lord .
TROILUS : It is .
ULYSSES : Why stay we , then ?
