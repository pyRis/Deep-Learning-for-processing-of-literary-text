TROILUS : Sweet sir , you honour me .
HECTOR : And so , good night . Exit DIOMEDES ; ULYSSES and TROILUS following
ACHILLES : Come , come , enter my tent .
THERSITES : That same Diomed 's a false-hearted rogue , a most unjust knave ; I will no more trust him when he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses : he will spend his mouth , and promise , like Brabbler the hound : but when he performs , astronomers foretell it ; it is prodigious , there will come some change ; the sun borrows of the moon , when Diomed keeps his word . I will rather leave to see Hector , than not to dog him : they say he keeps a Trojan drab , and uses the traitor Calchas ' tent : I 'll after . Nothing but lechery ! all incontinent varlets ! Exit Enter DIOMEDES
DIOMEDES : What , are you up here , ho ? speak .
CALCHAS : Who calls ?
DIOMEDES : Calchas , I think . Where 's your daughter ?
CALCHAS : She comes to you . Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES , at a distance ; after them , THERSITES
ULYSSES : Stand where the torch may not discover us . Enter CRESSIDA
TROILUS : Cressid comes forth to him .
DIOMEDES : How now , my charge !
CRESSIDA : Now , my sweet guardian ! Hark , a word with you . Whispers
TROILUS : Yea , so familiar !
ULYSSES : She will sing any man at first sight .
THERSITES : And any man may sing her , if he can take her cliff ; she 's noted .
DIOMEDES : Will you remember ?
CRESSIDA : Remember ! yes .
DIOMEDES : Nay , but do , then ; And let your mind be coupled with your words .
TROILUS : What should she remember ?
ULYSSES : List .
CRESSIDA : Sweet honey Greek , tempt me no more to folly .
THERSITES : Roguery !
DIOMEDES : Nay , then , --
CRESSIDA : I 'll tell you what , --
DIOMEDES : Foh , foh ! come , tell a pin : you are forsworn .
CRESSIDA : In faith , I cannot : what would you have me do ?
THERSITES : A juggling trick , --to be secretly open .
DIOMEDES : What did you swear you would bestow on me ?
CRESSIDA : I prithee , do not hold me to mine oath ; Bid me do any thing but that , sweet Greek .
DIOMEDES : Good night .
TROILUS : Hold , patience !
ULYSSES : How now , Trojan !
CRESSIDA : Diomed , --
DIOMEDES : No , no , good night : I 'll be your fool no more .
TROILUS : Thy better must .
CRESSIDA : Hark , one word in your ear .
TROILUS : O plague and madness !
ULYSSES : You are moved , prince ; let us depart , I pray you , Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself To wrathful terms : this place is dangerous ; The time right deadly ; I beseech you , go .
TROILUS : Behold , I pray you !
ULYSSES : Nay , good my lord , go off : You flow to great distraction ; come , my lord .
TROILUS : I pray thee , stay .
ULYSSES : You have not patience ; come .
TROILUS : I pray you , stay ; by hell and all hell 's torments I will not speak a word !
DIOMEDES : And so , good night .
CRESSIDA : Nay , but you part in anger .
TROILUS : Doth that grieve thee ? O wither 'd truth !
ULYSSES : Why , how now , lord !
TROILUS : By Jove , I will be patient .
CRESSIDA : Guardian ! --why , Greek !
DIOMEDES : Foh , foh ! adieu ; you palter .
CRESSIDA : In faith , I do not : come hither once again .
ULYSSES : You shake , my lord , at something : will you go ? You will break out .
TROILUS : She strokes his cheek !
ULYSSES : Come , come .
TROILUS : Nay , stay ; by Jove , I will not speak a word : There is between my will and all offences A guard of patience : stay a little while .
