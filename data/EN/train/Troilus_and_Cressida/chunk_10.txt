NESTOR : Ulysses , Now I begin to relish thy advice ; And I will give a taste of it forthwith To Agamemnon : go we to him straight . Two curs shall tame each other : pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on , as ' twere their bone . Enter AJAX and THERSITES
AJAX : Thersites !
THERSITES : Agamemnon , how if he had boils ? full , all over , generally ?
AJAX : Thersites !
THERSITES : And those boils did run ? say so : did not the general run then ? were not that a botchy core ?
AJAX : Dog !
THERSITES : Then would come some matter from him ; I see none now .
AJAX : Thou bitch-wolf 's son , canst thou not hear ? Beating him Feel , then .
THERSITES : The plague of Greece upon thee , thou mongrel beef-witted lord !
AJAX : Speak then , thou vinewedst leaven , speak : I will beat thee into handsomeness .
THERSITES : I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness : but , I think , thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book . Thou canst strike , canst thou ? a red murrain o ' thy jade 's tricks !
AJAX : Toadstool , learn me the proclamation .
THERSITES : Dost thou think I have no sense , thou strikest me thus ?
AJAX : The proclamation !
THERSITES : Thou art proclaimed a fool , I think .
AJAX : Do not , porpentine , do not : my fingers itch .
THERSITES : I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee ; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece . When thou art forth in the incursions , thou strikest as slow as another .
AJAX : I say , the proclamation !
THERSITES : Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles , and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpine 's beauty , ay , that thou barkest at him .
AJAX : Mistress Thersites !
THERSITES : Thou shouldest strike him .
AJAX : Cobloaf !
THERSITES : He would pun thee into shivers with his fist , as a sailor breaks a biscuit .
AJAX : You whoreson cur !
THERSITES : Do , do .
AJAX : Thou stool for a witch !
THERSITES : Ay , do , do ; thou sodden-witted lord ! thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows ; an assinego may tutor thee : thou scurvy-valiant ass ! thou art here but to thrash Trojans ; and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit , like a barbarian slave . If thou use to beat me , I will begin at thy heel , and tell what thou art by inches , thou thing of no bowels , thou !

ACHILLES : Ay ; what 's the matter ?
THERSITES : Nay , look upon him .
ACHILLES : So I do : what 's the matter ?
THERSITES : Nay , but regard him well .
ACHILLES : ' Well ! ' why , I do so .
THERSITES : But yet you look not well upon him ; for whosoever you take him to be , he is Ajax .

THERSITES : Ay , but that fool knows not himself .
AJAX : Therefore I beat thee .
