AGAMEMNON : Is not yond Diomed , with Calchas ' daughter ?
ULYSSES : ' Tis he , I ken the manner of his gait ; He rises on the toe : that spirit of his In aspiration lifts him from the earth . Enter DIOMEDES , with CRESSIDA
AGAMEMNON : Is this the Lady Cressid ?
DIOMEDES : Even she .
AGAMEMNON : Most dearly welcome to the Greeks , sweet lady .
NESTOR : Our general doth salute you with a kiss .
ULYSSES : Yet is the kindness but particular ; ' Twere better she were kiss 'd in general .
NESTOR : And very courtly counsel : I 'll begin . So much for Nestor .
ACHILLES : I 'll take what winter from your lips , fair lady : Achilles bids you welcome .
MENELAUS : I had good argument for kissing once .
PATROCLUS : But that 's no argument for kissing now ; For this popp 'd Paris in his hardiment , And parted thus you and your argument .
ULYSSES : O deadly gall , and theme of all our scorns ! For which we lose our heads to gild his horns .
PATROCLUS : The first was Menelaus ' kiss ; this , mine : Patroclus kisses you .
MENELAUS : O , this is trim !
PATROCLUS : Paris and I kiss evermore for him .
MENELAUS : I 'll have my kiss , sir . Lady , by your leave .
CRESSIDA : In kissing , do you render or receive ?
PATROCLUS : Both take and give .
CRESSIDA : I 'll make my match to live , The kiss you take is better than you give ; Therefore no kiss .
MENELAUS : I 'll give you boot , I 'll give you three for one .
CRESSIDA : You 're an odd man ; give even or give none .
MENELAUS : An odd man , lady ! every man is odd .
CRESSIDA : No , Paris is not ; for you know ' tis true , That you are odd , and he is even with you .
MENELAUS : You fillip me o ' the head .
CRESSIDA : No , I 'll be sworn .
ULYSSES : It were no match , your nail against his horn . May I , sweet lady , beg a kiss of you ?
CRESSIDA : You may .
ULYSSES : I do desire it .
CRESSIDA : Why , beg , then .
ULYSSES : Why then for Venus ' sake , give me a kiss , When Helen is a maid again , and his .
CRESSIDA : I am your debtor , claim it when ' tis due .
ULYSSES : Never 's my day , and then a kiss of you .
DIOMEDES : Lady , a word : I 'll bring you to your father . Exit with CRESSIDA
NESTOR : A woman of quick sense .
ULYSSES : Fie , fie upon her ! There 's language in her eye , her cheek , her lip , Nay , her foot speaks ; her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive of her body . O , these encounterers , so glib of tongue , That give accosting welcome ere it comes , And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts To every ticklish reader ! set them down For sluttish spoils of opportunity And daughters of the game . Trumpet within
ALL : The Trojans ' trumpet .
AGAMEMNON : Yonder comes the troop . Enter HECTOR , armed ; AENEAS , TROILUS , and other Trojans , with Attendants
AENEAS : Hail , all you state of Greece ! what shall be done To him that victory commands ? or do you purpose A victor shall be known ? will you the knights Shall to the edge of all extremity Pursue each other , or shall be divided By any voice or order of the field ? Hector bade ask .
AGAMEMNON : Which way would Hector have it ?
AENEAS : He cares not ; he 'll obey conditions .
ACHILLES : ' Tis done like Hector ; but securely done , A little proudly , and great deal misprizing The knight opposed .
AENEAS : If not Achilles , sir , What is your name ?
ACHILLES : If not Achilles , nothing .
