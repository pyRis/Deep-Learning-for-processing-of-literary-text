KING CLAUDIUS : Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ! Moreover that we much did long to see you , The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending . Something have you heard Of Hamlet 's transformation ; so call it , Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was . What it should be , More than his father 's death , that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself , I cannot dream of : I entreat you both , That , being of so young days brought up with him , And sith so neighbour 'd to his youth and havior , That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time : so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures , and to gather , So much as from occasion you may glean , Whether aught , to us unknown , afflicts him thus , That , open 'd , lies within our remedy .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Good gentlemen , he hath much talk 'd of you ; And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres . If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile , For the supply and profit of our hope , Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king 's remembrance .
ROSENCRANTZ : Both your majesties Might , by the sovereign power you have of us , Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty .
GUILDENSTERN : But we both obey , And here give up ourselves , in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet , To be commanded .
KING CLAUDIUS : Thanks , Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Thanks , Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz : And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son . Go , some of you , And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is .
GUILDENSTERN : Heavens make our presence and our practises Pleasant and helpful to him !
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Ay , amen ! Enter POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS : The ambassadors from Norway , my good lord , Are joyfully return 'd .
KING CLAUDIUS : Thou still hast been the father of good news .
LORD POLONIUS : Have I , my lord ? I assure my good liege , I hold my duty , as I hold my soul , Both to my God and to my gracious king : And I do think , or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do , that I have found The very cause of Hamlet 's lunacy .
KING CLAUDIUS : O , speak of that ; that do I long to hear .
LORD POLONIUS : Give first admittance to the ambassadors ; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
KING CLAUDIUS : Thyself do grace to them , and bring them in . Exit POLONIUS He tells me , my dear Gertrude , he hath found The head and source of all your son 's distemper .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : I doubt it is no other but the main ; His father 's death , and our o 'erhasty marriage .
KING CLAUDIUS : Well , we shall sift him . Re-enter POLONIUS , with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS Welcome , my good friends ! Say , Voltimand , what from our brother Norway ?
