LORD POLONIUS : And the queen too , and that presently .
HAMLET : Bid the players make haste . Exit POLONIUS Will you two help to hasten them ?
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN : We will , my lord .
HAMLET : What ho ! Horatio ! Enter HORATIO
HORATIO : Here , sweet lord , at your service .
HAMLET : Horatio , thou art e 'en as just a man As e 'er my conversation coped withal .
HORATIO : O , my dear lord , --
HAMLET : Nay , do not think I flatter ; For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits , To feed and clothe thee ? Why should the poor be flatter 'd ? No , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning . Dost thou hear ? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish , her election Hath seal 'd thee for herself ; for thou hast been As one , in suffering all , that suffers nothing , A man that fortune 's buffets and rewards Hast ta 'en with equal thanks : and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled , That they are not a pipe for fortune 's finger To sound what stop she please . Give me that man That is not passion 's slave , and I will wear him In my heart 's core , ay , in my heart of heart , As I do thee.--Something too much of this.-- There is a play to-night before the king ; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father 's death : I prithee , when thou seest that act afoot , Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle : if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech , It is a damned ghost that we have seen , And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan 's stithy . Give him heedful note ; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face , And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming .
HORATIO : Well , my lord : If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing , And ' scape detecting , I will pay the theft .
HAMLET : They are coming to the play ; I must be idle : Get you a place . Danish march . A flourish . Enter KING CLAUDIUS , QUEEN GERTRUDE , POLONIUS , OPHELIA , ROSENCRANTZ , GUILDENSTERN , and others
KING CLAUDIUS : How fares our cousin Hamlet ?
HAMLET : Excellent , i ' faith ; of the chameleon 's dish : I eat the air , promise-crammed : you cannot feed capons so .
KING CLAUDIUS : I have nothing with this answer , Hamlet ; these words are not mine .
HAMLET : No , nor mine now . To POLONIUS My lord , you played once i ' the university , you say ?
LORD POLONIUS : That did I , my lord ; and was accounted a good actor .
HAMLET : What did you enact ?
LORD POLONIUS : I did enact Julius Caesar : I was killed i ' the Capitol ; Brutus killed me .
HAMLET : It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there . Be the players ready ?
ROSENCRANTZ : Ay , my lord ; they stay upon your patience .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Come hither , my dear Hamlet , sit by me .
HAMLET : No , good mother , here 's metal more attractive .
LORD POLONIUS : O , ho ! do you mark that ?
HAMLET : Lady , shall I lie in your lap ? Lying down at OPHELIA 's feet
OPHELIA : No , my lord .
HAMLET : I mean , my head upon your lap ?
OPHELIA : Ay , my lord .
HAMLET : Do you think I meant country matters ?
OPHELIA : I think nothing , my lord .
HAMLET : That 's a fair thought to lie between maids ' legs .
OPHELIA : What is , my lord ?
HAMLET : Nothing .
OPHELIA : You are merry , my lord .
HAMLET : Who , I ?
OPHELIA : Ay , my lord .
