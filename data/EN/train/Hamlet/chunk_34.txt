QUEEN GERTRUDE : I will not speak with her .
Gentleman : She is importunate , indeed distract : Her mood will needs be pitied .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : What would she have ?
Gentleman : She speaks much of her father ; says she hears There 's tricks i ' the world ; and hems , and beats her heart ; Spurns enviously at straws ; speaks things in doubt , That carry but half sense : her speech is nothing , Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection ; they aim at it , And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts ; Which , as her winks , and nods , and gestures yield them , Indeed would make one think there might be thought , Though nothing sure , yet much unhappily .
HORATIO : ' Twere good she were spoken with ; for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Let her come in . Exit HORATIO To my sick soul , as sin 's true nature is , Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss : So full of artless jealousy is guilt , It spills itself in fearing to be spilt . Re-enter HORATIO , with OPHELIA
OPHELIA : Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : How now , Ophelia !
OPHELIA : How should I your true love know From another one ? By his cockle hat and staff , And his sandal shoon .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Alas , sweet lady , what imports this song ?
OPHELIA : Say you ? nay , pray you , mark . Sings He is dead and gone , lady , He is dead and gone ; At his head a grass-green turf , At his heels a stone .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Nay , but , Ophelia , --
OPHELIA : Pray you , mark . Sings White his shroud as the mountain snow , -- Enter KING CLAUDIUS
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Alas , look here , my lord .
OPHELIA : Larded with sweet flowers Which bewept to the grave did go With true-love showers .
KING CLAUDIUS : How do you , pretty lady ?
OPHELIA : Well , God ' ild you ! They say the owl was a baker 's daughter . Lord , we know what we are , but know not what we may be . God be at your table !
KING CLAUDIUS : Conceit upon her father .
OPHELIA : Pray you , let 's have no words of this ; but when they ask you what it means , say you this : Sings To-morrow is Saint Valentine 's day , All in the morning betime , And I a maid at your window , To be your Valentine . Then up he rose , and donn 'd his clothes , And dupp 'd the chamber-door ; Let in the maid , that out a maid Never departed more .
KING CLAUDIUS : Pretty Ophelia !
OPHELIA : Indeed , la , without an oath , I 'll make an end on 't : Sings By Gis and by Saint Charity , Alack , and fie for shame ! Young men will do 't , if they come to 't ; By cock , they are to blame . Quoth she , before you tumbled me , You promised me to wed . So would I ha ' done , by yonder sun , An thou hadst not come to my bed .
KING CLAUDIUS : How long hath she been thus ?
OPHELIA : I hope all will be well . We must be patient : but I cannot choose but weep , to think they should lay him i ' the cold ground . My brother shall know of it : and so I thank you for your good counsel . Come , my coach ! Good night , ladies ; good night , sweet ladies ; good night , good night . Exit
