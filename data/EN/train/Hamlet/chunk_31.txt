QUEEN GERTRUDE : Be thou assured , if words be made of breath , And breath of life , I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me .
HAMLET : I must to England ; you know that ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Alack , I had forgot : ' tis so concluded on .
HAMLET : There 's letters seal 'd : and my two schoolfellows , Whom I will trust as I will adders fang 'd , They bear the mandate ; they must sweep my way , And marshal me to knavery . Let it work ; For ' tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard : and ' t shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines , And blow them at the moon : O , ' tis most sweet , When in one line two crafts directly meet . This man shall set me packing : I 'll lug the guts into the neighbour room . Mother , good night . Indeed this counsellor Is now most still , most secret and most grave , Who was in life a foolish prating knave . Come , sir , to draw toward an end with you . Good night , mother . Enter KING CLAUDIUS , QUEEN GERTRUDE , ROSENCRANTZ , and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS : There 's matter in these sighs , these profound heaves : You must translate : ' tis fit we understand them . Where is your son ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Bestow this place on us a little while . Ah , my good lord , what have I seen to-night !
KING CLAUDIUS : What , Gertrude ? How does Hamlet ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Mad as the sea and wind , when both contend Which is the mightier : in his lawless fit , Behind the arras hearing something stir , Whips out his rapier , cries , ' A rat , a rat ! ' And , in this brainish apprehension , kills The unseen good old man .
KING CLAUDIUS : O heavy deed ! It had been so with us , had we been there : His liberty is full of threats to all ; To you yourself , to us , to every one . Alas , how shall this bloody deed be answer 'd ? It will be laid to us , whose providence Should have kept short , restrain 'd and out of haunt , This mad young man : but so much was our love , We would not understand what was most fit ; But , like the owner of a foul disease , To keep it from divulging , let it feed Even on the pith of Life . Where is he gone ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : To draw apart the body he hath kill 'd : O 'er whom his very madness , like some ore Among a mineral of metals base , Shows itself pure ; he weeps for what is done .
KING CLAUDIUS : O Gertrude , come away ! The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch , But we will ship him hence : and this vile deed We must , with all our majesty and skill , Both countenance and excuse . Ho , Guildenstern ! Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN Friends both , go join you with some further aid : Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain , And from his mother 's closet hath he dragg 'd him : Go seek him out ; speak fair , and bring the body Into the chapel . I pray you , haste in this . Come , Gertrude , we 'll call up our wisest friends ; And let them know , both what we mean to do , And what 's untimely done . O , come away ! My soul is full of discord and dismay . Enter HAMLET
HAMLET : Safely stowed .
ROSENCRANTZ : GUILDENSTERN : : Hamlet ! Lord Hamlet !
HAMLET : What noise ? who calls on Hamlet ? O , here they come . Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
ROSENCRANTZ : What have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
HAMLET : Compounded it with dust , whereto ' tis kin .
ROSENCRANTZ : Tell us where ' tis , that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel .
HAMLET : Do not believe it .
ROSENCRANTZ : Believe what ?
