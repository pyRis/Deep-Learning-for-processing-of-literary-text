HAMLET : Now might I do it pat , now he is praying ; And now I 'll do 't . And so he goes to heaven ; And so am I revenged . That would be scann 'd : A villain kills my father ; and for that , I , his sole son , do this same villain send To heaven . O , this is hire and salary , not revenge . He took my father grossly , full of bread ; With all his crimes broad blown , as flush as May ; And how his audit stands who knows save heaven ? But in our circumstance and course of thought , ' Tis heavy with him : and am I then revenged , To take him in the purging of his soul , When he is fit and season 'd for his passage ? No ! Up , sword ; and know thou a more horrid hent : When he is drunk asleep , or in his rage , Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed ; At gaming , swearing , or about some act That has no relish of salvation in 't ; Then trip him , that his heels may kick at heaven , And that his soul may be as damn 'd and black As hell , whereto it goes . My mother stays : This physic but prolongs thy sickly days . Exit
KING CLAUDIUS : My words fly up , my thoughts remain below : Words without thoughts never to heaven go . Exit Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS : He will come straight . Look you lay home to him : Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with , And that your grace hath screen 'd and stood between Much heat and him . I 'll sconce me even here . Pray you , be round with him .
HAMLET : Mother , mother , mother !
QUEEN GERTRUDE : I 'll warrant you , Fear me not : withdraw , I hear him coming . POLONIUS hides behind the arras Enter HAMLET
HAMLET : Now , mother , what 's the matter ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Hamlet , thou hast thy father much offended .
HAMLET : Mother , you have my father much offended .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Come , come , you answer with an idle tongue .
HAMLET : Go , go , you question with a wicked tongue .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Why , how now , Hamlet !
HAMLET : What 's the matter now ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Have you forgot me ?
HAMLET : No , by the rood , not so : You are the queen , your husband 's brother 's wife ; And--would it were not so ! --you are my mother .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Nay , then , I 'll set those to you that can speak .
HAMLET : Come , come , and sit you down ; you shall not budge ; You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : What wilt thou do ? thou wilt not murder me ? Help , help , ho !
LORD POLONIUS : What , ho ! help , help , help !
HAMLET : How now ! a rat ? Dead , for a ducat , dead ! Makes a pass through the arras
LORD POLONIUS : O , I am slain ! Falls and dies
QUEEN GERTRUDE : O me , what hast thou done ?
HAMLET : Nay , I know not : Is it the king ?
QUEEN GERTRUDE : O , what a rash and bloody deed is this !
HAMLET : A bloody deed ! almost as bad , good mother , As kill a king , and marry with his brother .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : As kill a king !
