HAMLET : Come on , sir .
LAERTES : Come , my lord . They play
HAMLET : One .
LAERTES : No .
HAMLET : Judgment .
OSRIC : A hit , a very palpable hit .
LAERTES : Well ; again .
KING CLAUDIUS : Stay ; give me drink . Hamlet , this pearl is thine ; Here 's to thy health . Trumpets sound , and cannon shot off within Give him the cup .
HAMLET : I 'll play this bout first ; set it by awhile . Come . They play Another hit ; what say you ?
LAERTES : A touch , a touch , I do confess .
KING CLAUDIUS : Our son shall win .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : He 's fat , and scant of breath . Here , Hamlet , take my napkin , rub thy brows ; The queen carouses to thy fortune , Hamlet .
HAMLET : Good madam !
KING CLAUDIUS : Gertrude , do not drink .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : I will , my lord ; I pray you , pardon me .
KING CLAUDIUS : It is the poison 'd cup : it is too late .
HAMLET : I dare not drink yet , madam ; by and by .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : Come , let me wipe thy face .
LAERTES : My lord , I 'll hit him now .
KING CLAUDIUS : I do not think 't .
LAERTES : And yet ' tis almost ' gainst my conscience .
HAMLET : Come , for the third , Laertes : you but dally ; I pray you , pass with your best violence ; I am afeard you make a wanton of me .
LAERTES : Say you so ? come on . They play
OSRIC : Nothing , neither way .
LAERTES : Have at you now ! LAERTES wounds HAMLET ; then in scuffling , they change rapiers , and HAMLET wounds LAERTES
KING CLAUDIUS : Part them ; they are incensed .
HAMLET : Nay , come , again . QUEEN GERTRUDE falls
OSRIC : Look to the queen there , ho !
HORATIO : They bleed on both sides . How is it , my lord ?
OSRIC : How is 't , Laertes ?
LAERTES : Why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , Osric ; I am justly kill 'd with mine own treachery .
HAMLET : How does the queen ?
KING CLAUDIUS : She swounds to see them bleed .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : No , no , the drink , the drink , --O my dear Hamlet , -- The drink , the drink ! I am poison 'd . Dies
HAMLET : O villany ! Ho ! let the door be lock 'd : Treachery ! Seek it out .
LAERTES : It is here , Hamlet : Hamlet , thou art slain ; No medicine in the world can do thee good ; In thee there is not half an hour of life ; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand , Unbated and envenom 'd : the foul practise Hath turn 'd itself on me lo , here I lie , Never to rise again : thy mother 's poison 'd : I can no more : the king , the king 's to blame .
HAMLET : The point ! --envenom 'd too ! Then , venom , to thy work . Stabs KING CLAUDIUS
All : Treason ! treason !
KING CLAUDIUS : O , yet defend me , friends ; I am but hurt .
HAMLET : Here , thou incestuous , murderous , damned Dane , Drink off this potion . Is thy union here ? Follow my mother . KING CLAUDIUS dies
LAERTES : He is justly served ; It is a poison temper 'd by himself . Exchange forgiveness with me , noble Hamlet : Mine and my father 's death come not upon thee , Nor thine on me . Dies
HAMLET : Heaven make thee free of it ! I follow thee . I am dead , Horatio . Wretched queen , adieu ! You that look pale and tremble at this chance , That are but mutes or audience to this act , Had I but time--as this fell sergeant , death , Is strict in his arrest--O , I could tell you-- But let it be . Horatio , I am dead ; Thou livest ; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied .
