KING CLAUDIUS : Not that I know .
LORD POLONIUS : Take this from this , if this be otherwise : If circumstances lead me , I will find Where truth is hid , though it were hid indeed Within the centre .
KING CLAUDIUS : How may we try it further ?
LORD POLONIUS : You know , sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : So he does indeed .
LORD POLONIUS : At such a time I 'll loose my daughter to him : Be you and I behind an arras then ; Mark the encounter : if he love her not And be not from his reason fall 'n thereon , Let me be no assistant for a state , But keep a farm and carters .
KING CLAUDIUS : We will try it .
QUEEN GERTRUDE : But , look , where sadly the poor wretch comes reading .
LORD POLONIUS : Away , I do beseech you , both away : I 'll board him presently . Enter HAMLET , reading O , give me leave : How does my good Lord Hamlet ?
HAMLET : Well , God-a-mercy .
LORD POLONIUS : Do you know me , my lord ?
HAMLET : Excellent well ; you are a fishmonger .
LORD POLONIUS : Not I , my lord .
HAMLET : Then I would you were so honest a man .
LORD POLONIUS : Honest , my lord !
HAMLET : Ay , sir ; to be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
LORD POLONIUS : That 's very true , my lord .
HAMLET : For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a god kissing carrion , --Have you a daughter ?
LORD POLONIUS : I have , my lord .
HAMLET : Let her not walk i ' the sun : conception is a blessing : but not as your daughter may conceive . Friend , look to ' t .
LORD POLONIUS : How say you by that ? Still harping on my daughter : yet he knew me not at first ; he said I was a fishmonger : he is far gone , far gone : and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love ; very near this . I 'll speak to him again . What do you read , my lord ?
HAMLET : Words , words , words .
LORD POLONIUS : What is the matter , my lord ?
HAMLET : Between who ?
LORD POLONIUS : I mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
HAMLET : Slanders , sir : for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards , that their faces are wrinkled , their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit , together with most weak hams : all which , sir , though I most powerfully and potently believe , yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down , for yourself , sir , should be old as I am , if like a crab you could go backward .
LORD POLONIUS : Though this be madness , yet there is method in ' t . Will you walk out of the air , my lord ?
HAMLET : Into my grave .
LORD POLONIUS : Indeed , that is out o ' the air . Aside How pregnant sometimes his replies are ! a happiness that often madness hits on , which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of . I will leave him , and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable lord , I will most humbly take my leave of you .
HAMLET : You cannot , sir , take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal : except my life , except my life , except my life .
LORD POLONIUS : Fare you well , my lord .
HAMLET : These tedious old fools ! Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
LORD POLONIUS : You go to seek the Lord Hamlet ; there he is .
ROSENCRANTZ : God save you , sir ! Exit POLONIUS
GUILDENSTERN : My honoured lord !
ROSENCRANTZ : My most dear lord !
