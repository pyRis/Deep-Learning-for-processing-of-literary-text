HAMLET : O all you host of heaven ! O earth ! what else ? And shall I couple hell ? O , fie ! Hold , hold , my heart ; And you , my sinews , grow not instant old , But bear me stiffly up . Remember thee ! Ay , thou poor ghost , while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe . Remember thee ! Yea , from the table of my memory I 'll wipe away all trivial fond records , All saws of books , all forms , all pressures past , That youth and observation copied there ; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain , Unmix 'd with baser matter : yes , by heaven ! O most pernicious woman ! O villain , villain , smiling , damned villain ! My tables , --meet it is I set it down , That one may smile , and smile , and be a villain ; At least I 'm sure it may be so in Denmark : Writing So , uncle , there you are . Now to my word ; It is ' Adieu , adieu ! remember me . ' I have sworn ' t .
MARCELLUS HORATIO : My lord , my lord , --
MARCELLUS : Lord Hamlet , --
HORATIO : Heaven secure him !
HAMLET : So be it !
HORATIO : Hillo , ho , ho , my lord !
HAMLET : Hillo , ho , ho , boy ! come , bird , come . Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
MARCELLUS : How is 't , my noble lord ?
HORATIO : What news , my lord ?
HAMLET : O , wonderful !
HORATIO : Good my lord , tell it .
HAMLET : No ; you 'll reveal it .
HORATIO : Not I , my lord , by heaven .
MARCELLUS : Nor I , my lord .
HAMLET : How say you , then ; would heart of man once think it ? But you 'll be secret ?
HORATIO MARCELLUS : Ay , by heaven , my lord .
HAMLET : There 's ne 'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he 's an arrant knave .
HORATIO : There needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave To tell us this .
HAMLET : Why , right ; you are i ' the right ; And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands and part : You , as your business and desire shall point you ; For every man has business and desire , Such as it is ; and for mine own poor part , Look you , I 'll go pray .
HORATIO : These are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
HAMLET : I 'm sorry they offend you , heartily ; Yes , ' faith heartily .
HORATIO : There 's no offence , my lord .
HAMLET : Yes , by Saint Patrick , but there is , Horatio , And much offence too . Touching this vision here , It is an honest ghost , that let me tell you : For your desire to know what is between us , O 'ermaster ' t as you may . And now , good friends , As you are friends , scholars and soldiers , Give me one poor request .
HORATIO : What is 't , my lord ? we will .
HAMLET : Never make known what you have seen to-night .
HORATIO MARCELLUS : My lord , we will not .
HAMLET : Nay , but swear 't .
HORATIO : In faith , My lord , not I.
MARCELLUS : Nor I , my lord , in faith .
HAMLET : Upon my sword .
MARCELLUS : We have sworn , my lord , already .
HAMLET : Indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
Ghost : Swear .
HAMLET : Ah , ha , boy ! say 'st thou so ? art thou there , truepenny ? Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage-- Consent to swear .
HORATIO : Propose the oath , my lord .
HAMLET : Never to speak of this that you have seen , Swear by my sword .
Ghost : Swear .
