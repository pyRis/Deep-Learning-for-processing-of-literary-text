GUILDENSTERN : Good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
HAMLET : Sir , a whole history .
GUILDENSTERN : The king , sir , --
HAMLET : Ay , sir , what of him ?
GUILDENSTERN : Is in his retirement marvellous distempered .
HAMLET : With drink , sir ?
GUILDENSTERN : No , my lord , rather with choler .
HAMLET : Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor ; for , for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler .
GUILDENSTERN : Good my lord , put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair .
HAMLET : I am tame , sir : pronounce .
GUILDENSTERN : The queen , your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
HAMLET : You are welcome .
GUILDENSTERN : Nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed . If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer , I will do your mother 's commandment : if not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
HAMLET : Sir , I cannot .
GUILDENSTERN : What , my lord ?
HAMLET : Make you a wholesome answer ; my wit 's diseased : but , sir , such answer as I can make , you shall command ; or , rather , as you say , my mother : therefore no more , but to the matter : my mother , you say , --
ROSENCRANTZ : Then thus she says ; your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration .
HAMLET : O wonderful son , that can so astonish a mother ! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother 's admiration ? Impart .
ROSENCRANTZ : She desires to speak with you in her closet , ere you go to bed .
HAMLET : We shall obey , were she ten times our mother . Have you any further trade with us ?
ROSENCRANTZ : My lord , you once did love me .
HAMLET : So I do still , by these pickers and stealers .
ROSENCRANTZ : Good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ? you do , surely , bar the door upon your own liberty , if you deny your griefs to your friend .
HAMLET : Sir , I lack advancement .
ROSENCRANTZ : How can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark ?
HAMLET : Ay , but sir , ' While the grass grows , ' --the proverb is something musty . Re-enter Players with recorders O , the recorders ! let me see one . To withdraw with you : --why do you go about to recover the wind of me , as if you would drive me into a toil ?
GUILDENSTERN : O , my lord , if my duty be too bold , my love is too unmannerly .
HAMLET : I do not well understand that . Will you play upon this pipe ?
GUILDENSTERN : My lord , I cannot .
HAMLET : I pray you .
GUILDENSTERN : Believe me , I cannot .
HAMLET : I do beseech you .
GUILDENSTERN : I know no touch of it , my lord .
HAMLET : ' Tis as easy as lying : govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb , give it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most eloquent music . Look you , these are the stops .
GUILDENSTERN : But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony ; I have not the skill .
