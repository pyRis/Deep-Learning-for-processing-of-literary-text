JESSICA : I will make fast the doors , and gild myself With some more ducats , and be with you straight . Exit above
GRATIANO : Now , by my hood , a Gentile and no Jew .
LORENZO : Beshrew me but I love her heartily ; For she is wise , if I can judge of her , And fair she is , if that mine eyes be true , And true she is , as she hath proved herself , And therefore , like herself , wise , fair and true , Shall she be placed in my constant soul . Enter JESSICA , below What , art thou come ? On , gentlemen ; away ! Our masquing mates by this time for us stay . Exit with Jessica and Salarino Enter ANTONIO
ANTONIO : Who 's there ?
GRATIANO : Signior Antonio !
ANTONIO : Fie , fie , Gratiano ! where are all the rest ? ' Tis nine o 'clock : our friends all stay for you . No masque to-night : the wind is come about ; Bassanio presently will go aboard : I have sent twenty out to seek for you .
GRATIANO : I am glad on 't : I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone to-night . Flourish of cornets . Enter PORTIA , with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO , and their trains
PORTIA : Go draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble prince . Now make your choice .
MOROCCO : The first , of gold , who this inscription bears , ' Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ; ' The second , silver , which this promise carries , ' Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ; ' This third , dull lead , with warning all as blunt , ' Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . ' How shall I know if I do choose the right ?
PORTIA : The one of them contains my picture , prince : If you choose that , then I am yours withal .
