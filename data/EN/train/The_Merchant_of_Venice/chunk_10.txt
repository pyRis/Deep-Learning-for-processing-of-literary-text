LAUNCELOT : Adieu ! tears exhibit my tongue . Most beautiful pagan , most sweet Jew ! if a Christian did not play the knave and get thee , I am much deceived . But , adieu : these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit : adieu .
JESSICA : Farewell , good Launcelot . Exit Launcelot Alack , what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father 's child ! But though I am a daughter to his blood , I am not to his manners . O Lorenzo , If thou keep promise , I shall end this strife , Become a Christian and thy loving wife . Exit Enter GRATIANO , LORENZO , SALARINO , and SALANIO
LORENZO : Nay , we will slink away in supper-time , Disguise us at my lodging and return , All in an hour .
GRATIANO : We have not made good preparation .
SALARINO : We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
SALANIO : ' Tis vile , unless it may be quaintly order 'd , And better in my mind not undertook .
LORENZO : ' Tis now but four o 'clock : we have two hours To furnish us . Enter LAUNCELOT , with a letter Friend Launcelot , what 's the news ?
LAUNCELOT : An it shall please you to break up this , it shall seem to signify .
LORENZO : I know the hand : in faith , ' tis a fair hand ; And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ .
GRATIANO : Love-news , in faith .
LAUNCELOT : By your leave , sir .
LORENZO : Whither goest thou ?
LAUNCELOT : Marry , sir , to bid my old master the Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian .
LORENZO : Hold here , take this : tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her ; speak it privately . Go , gentlemen , Exit Launcelot Will you prepare you for this masque tonight ? I am provided of a torch-bearer .
SALANIO : Ay , marry , I 'll be gone about it straight .
SALANIO : And so will I.
LORENZO : Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano 's lodging some hour hence .
SALARINO : ' Tis good we do so .
GRATIANO : Was not that letter from fair Jessica ?
LORENZO : I must needs tell thee all . She hath directed How I shall take her from her father 's house , What gold and jewels she is furnish 'd with , What page 's suit she hath in readiness . If e 'er the Jew her father come to heaven , It will be for his gentle daughter 's sake : And never dare misfortune cross her foot , Unless she do it under this excuse , That she is issue to a faithless Jew . Come , go with me ; peruse this as thou goest : Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r . Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT
SHYLOCK : Well , thou shalt see , thy eyes shall be thy judge , The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio : -- What , Jessica ! --thou shalt not gormandise , As thou hast done with me : --What , Jessica ! -- And sleep and snore , and rend apparel out ; -- Why , Jessica , I say !
LAUNCELOT : Why , Jessica !
SHYLOCK : Who bids thee call ? I do not bid thee call .
LAUNCELOT : Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding . Enter Jessica
JESSICA : Call you ? what is your will ?
SHYLOCK : I am bid forth to supper , Jessica : There are my keys . But wherefore should I go ? I am not bid for love ; they flatter me : But yet I 'll go in hate , to feed upon The prodigal Christian . Jessica , my girl , Look to my house . I am right loath to go : There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest , For I did dream of money-bags to-night .
LAUNCELOT : I beseech you , sir , go : my young master doth expect your reproach .
SHYLOCK : So do I his .
