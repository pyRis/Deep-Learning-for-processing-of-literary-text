GRATIANO : Why , this is like the mending of highways In summer , where the ways are fair enough : What , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?
PORTIA : Speak not so grossly . You are all amazed : Here is a letter ; read it at your leisure ; It comes from Padua , from Bellario : There you shall find that Portia was the doctor , Nerissa there her clerk : Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you And even but now return 'd ; I have not yet Enter 'd my house . Antonio , you are welcome ; And I have better news in store for you Than you expect : unseal this letter soon ; There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly : You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter .
ANTONIO : I am dumb .
BASSANIO : Were you the doctor and I knew you not ?
GRATIANO : Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold ?
NERISSA : Ay , but the clerk that never means to do it , Unless he live until he be a man .
BASSANIO : Sweet doctor , you shall be my bed-fellow : When I am absent , then lie with my wife .
ANTONIO : Sweet lady , you have given me life and living ; For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road .
PORTIA : How now , Lorenzo ! My clerk hath some good comforts too for you .
NERISSA : Ay , and I 'll give them him without a fee . There do I give to you and Jessica , From the rich Jew , a special deed of gift , After his death , of all he dies possess 'd of .
LORENZO : Fair ladies , you drop manna in the way Of starved people .
PORTIA : It is almost morning , And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full . Let us go in ; And charge us there upon inter 'gatories , And we will answer all things faithfully .
