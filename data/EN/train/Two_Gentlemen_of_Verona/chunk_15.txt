VALENTINE : And why not death rather than living torment ? To die is to be banish 'd from myself ; And Silvia is myself : banish 'd from her Is self from self : a deadly banishment ! What light is light , if Silvia be not seen ? What joy is joy , if Silvia be not by ? Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection Except I be by Silvia in the night , There is no music in the nightingale ; Unless I look on Silvia in the day , There is no day for me to look upon ; She is my essence , and I leave to be , If I be not by her fair influence Foster 'd , illumined , cherish 'd , kept alive . I fly not death , to fly his deadly doom : Tarry I here , I but attend on death : But , fly I hence , I fly away from life . Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
PROTEUS : Run , boy , run , run , and seek him out .
LAUNCE : Soho , soho !
PROTEUS : What seest thou ?
LAUNCE : Him we go to find : there 's not a hair on 's head but ' tis a Valentine .
PROTEUS : Valentine ?
VALENTINE : No .
PROTEUS : Who then ? his spirit ?
VALENTINE : Neither .
PROTEUS : What then ?
VALENTINE : Nothing .
LAUNCE : Can nothing speak ? Master , shall I strike ?
PROTEUS : Who wouldst thou strike ?
LAUNCE : Nothing .
PROTEUS : Villain , forbear .
LAUNCE : Why , sir , I 'll strike nothing : I pray you , --
PROTEUS : Sirrah , I say , forbear . Friend Valentine , a word .
VALENTINE : My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news , So much of bad already hath possess 'd them .
PROTEUS : Then in dumb silence will I bury mine , For they are harsh , untuneable and bad .
VALENTINE : Is Silvia dead ?
PROTEUS : No , Valentine .
VALENTINE : No Valentine , indeed , for sacred Silvia . Hath she forsworn me ?
PROTEUS : No , Valentine .
VALENTINE : No Valentine , if Silvia have forsworn me . What is your news ?
LAUNCE : Sir , there is a proclamation that you are vanished .
PROTEUS : That thou art banished--O , that 's the news ! -- From hence , from Silvia and from me thy friend .
VALENTINE : O , I have fed upon this woe already , And now excess of it will make me surfeit . Doth Silvia know that I am banished ?
PROTEUS : Ay , ay ; and she hath offer 'd to the doom-- Which , unreversed , stands in effectual force-- A sea of melting pearl , which some call tears : Those at her father 's churlish feet she tender 'd ; With them , upon her knees , her humble self ; Wringing her hands , whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe : But neither bended knees , pure hands held up , Sad sighs , deep groans , nor silver-shedding tears , Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire ; But Valentine , if he be ta 'en , must die . Besides , her intercession chafed him so , When she for thy repeal was suppliant , That to close prison he commanded her , With many bitter threats of biding there .
VALENTINE : No more ; unless the next word that thou speak 'st Have some malignant power upon my life : If so , I pray thee , breathe it in mine ear , As ending anthem of my endless dolour .
