PANTHINO : Sir Proteus , your father calls for you : He is in haste ; therefore , I pray you to go .
PROTEUS : Why , this it is : my heart accords thereto , And yet a thousand times it answers ' no . ' Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
SPEED : Sir , your glove .
VALENTINE : Not mine ; my gloves are on .
SPEED : Why , then , this may be yours , for this is but one .
VALENTINE : Ha ! let me see : ay , give it me , it 's mine : Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine ! Ah , Silvia , Silvia !
SPEED : Madam Silvia ! Madam Silvia !
VALENTINE : How now , sirrah ?
SPEED : She is not within hearing , sir .
VALENTINE : Why , sir , who bade you call her ?
SPEED : Your worship , sir ; or else I mistook .
VALENTINE : Well , you 'll still be too forward .
SPEED : And yet I was last chidden for being too slow .
VALENTINE : Go to , sir : tell me , do you know Madam Silvia ?
SPEED : She that your worship loves ?
VALENTINE : Why , how know you that I am in love ?
SPEED : Marry , by these special marks : first , you have learned , like Sir Proteus , to wreathe your arms , like a malecontent ; to relish a love-song , like a robin-redbreast ; to walk alone , like one that had the pestilence ; to sigh , like a school-boy that had lost his A B C ; to weep , like a young wench that had buried her grandam ; to fast , like one that takes diet ; to watch like one that fears robbing ; to speak puling , like a beggar at Hallowmas . You were wont , when you laughed , to crow like a cock ; when you walked , to walk like one of the lions ; when you fasted , it was presently after dinner ; when you looked sadly , it was for want of money : and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress , that , when I look on you , I can hardly think you my master .
VALENTINE : Are all these things perceived in me ?
SPEED : They are all perceived without ye .
VALENTINE : Without me ? they cannot .
SPEED : Without you ? nay , that 's certain , for , without you were so simple , none else would : but you are so without these follies , that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal , that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady .
VALENTINE : But tell me , dost thou know my lady Silvia ?
SPEED : She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper ?
VALENTINE : Hast thou observed that ? even she , I mean .
SPEED : Why , sir , I know her not .
VALENTINE : Dost thou know her by my gazing on her , and yet knowest her not ?
SPEED : Is she not hard-favoured , sir ?
VALENTINE : Not so fair , boy , as well-favoured .
SPEED : Sir , I know that well enough .
VALENTINE : What dost thou know ?
SPEED : That she is not so fair as , of you , well-favoured .
VALENTINE : I mean that her beauty is exquisite , but her favour infinite .
SPEED : That 's because the one is painted and the other out of all count .
VALENTINE : How painted ? and how out of count ?
SPEED : Marry , sir , so painted , to make her fair , that no man counts of her beauty .
VALENTINE : How esteemest thou me ? I account of her beauty .
SPEED : You never saw her since she was deformed .
VALENTINE : How long hath she been deformed ?
SPEED : Ever since you loved her .
VALENTINE : I have loved her ever since I saw her ; and still I see her beautiful .
SPEED : If you love her , you cannot see her .
VALENTINE : Why ?
