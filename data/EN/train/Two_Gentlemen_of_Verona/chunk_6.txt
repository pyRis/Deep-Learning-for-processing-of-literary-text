VALENTINE : What should I see then ?
SPEED : Your own present folly and her passing deformity : for he , being in love , could not see to garter his hose , and you , being in love , cannot see to put on your hose .
VALENTINE : Belike , boy , then , you are in love ; for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes .
SPEED : True , sir ; I was in love with my bed : I thank you , you swinged me for my love , which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours .
VALENTINE : In conclusion , I stand affected to her .
SPEED : I would you were set , so your affection would cease .
VALENTINE : Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves .
SPEED : And have you ?
VALENTINE : I have .
SPEED : Are they not lamely writ ?
VALENTINE : No , boy , but as well as I can do them . Peace ! here she comes .
SPEED : O excellent motion ! O exceeding puppet ! Now will he interpret to her . Enter SILVIA
VALENTINE : Madam and mistress , a thousand good-morrows .
SPEED : O , give ye good even ! here 's a million of manners .
SILVIA : Sir Valentine and servant , to you two thousand .
SPEED : He should give her interest and she gives it him .
VALENTINE : As you enjoin 'd me , I have writ your letter Unto the secret nameless friend of yours ; Which I was much unwilling to proceed in But for my duty to your ladyship .
SILVIA : I thank you gentle servant : ' tis very clerkly done .
VALENTINE : Now trust me , madam , it came hardly off ; For being ignorant to whom it goes I writ at random , very doubtfully .
SILVIA : Perchance you think too much of so much pains ?
VALENTINE : No , madam ; so it stead you , I will write Please you command , a thousand times as much ; And yet--
SILVIA : A pretty period ! Well , I guess the sequel ; And yet I will not name it ; and yet I care not ; And yet take this again ; and yet I thank you , Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more .
SPEED : And yet you will ; and yet another ' yet . ' 
VALENTINE : What means your ladyship ? do you not like it ?
SILVIA : Yes , yes ; the lines are very quaintly writ ; But since unwillingly , take them again . Nay , take them .
VALENTINE : Madam , they are for you .
SILVIA : Ay , ay : you writ them , sir , at my request ; But I will none of them ; they are for you ; I would have had them writ more movingly .
VALENTINE : Please you , I 'll write your ladyship another .
SILVIA : And when it 's writ , for my sake read it over , And if it please you , so ; if not , why , so .
VALENTINE : If it please me , madam , what then ?
SILVIA : Why , if it please you , take it for your labour : And so , good morrow , servant . Exit
SPEED : O jest unseen , inscrutable , invisible , As a nose on a man 's face , or a weathercock on a steeple ! My master sues to her , and she hath taught her suitor , He being her pupil , to become her tutor . O excellent device ! was there ever heard a better , That my master , being scribe , to himself should write the letter ?
VALENTINE : How now , sir ? what are you reasoning with yourself ?
SPEED : Nay , I was rhyming : ' tis you that have the reason .
VALENTINE : To do what ?
SPEED : To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia .
VALENTINE : To whom ?
SPEED : To yourself : why , she wooes you by a figure .
VALENTINE : What figure ?
SPEED : By a letter , I should say .
VALENTINE : Why , she hath not writ to me ?
