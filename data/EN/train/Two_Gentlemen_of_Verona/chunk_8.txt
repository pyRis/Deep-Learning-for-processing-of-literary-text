PANTHINO : Launce , away , away , aboard ! thy master is shipped and thou art to post after with oars . What 's the matter ? why weepest thou , man ? Away , ass ! You 'll lose the tide , if you tarry any longer .
LAUNCE : It is no matter if the tied were lost ; for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied .
PANTHINO : What 's the unkindest tide ?
LAUNCE : Why , he that 's tied here , Crab , my dog .
PANTHINO : Tut , man , I mean thou 'lt lose the flood , and , in losing the flood , lose thy voyage , and , in losing thy voyage , lose thy master , and , in losing thy master , lose thy service , and , in losing thy service , --Why dost thou stop my mouth ?
LAUNCE : For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue .
PANTHINO : Where should I lose my tongue ?
LAUNCE : In thy tale .
PANTHINO : In thy tail !
LAUNCE : Lose the tide , and the voyage , and the master , and the service , and the tied ! Why , man , if the river were dry , I am able to fill it with my tears ; if the wind were down , I could drive the boat with my sighs .
PANTHINO : Come , come away , man ; I was sent to call thee .
LAUNCE : Sir , call me what thou darest .
PANTHINO : Wilt thou go ?
LAUNCE : Well , I will go . Enter SILVIA , VALENTINE , THURIO , and SPEED
SILVIA : Servant !
VALENTINE : Mistress ?
SPEED : Master , Sir Thurio frowns on you .
VALENTINE : Ay , boy , it 's for love .
SPEED : Not of you .
VALENTINE : Of my mistress , then .
SPEED : ' Twere good you knocked him . Exit
SILVIA : Servant , you are sad .
VALENTINE : Indeed , madam , I seem so .
THURIO : Seem you that you are not ?
VALENTINE : Haply I do .
THURIO : So do counterfeits .
VALENTINE : So do you .
THURIO : What seem I that I am not ?
VALENTINE : Wise .
THURIO : What instance of the contrary ?
VALENTINE : Your folly .
THURIO : And how quote you my folly ?
VALENTINE : I quote it in your jerkin .
THURIO : My jerkin is a doublet .
VALENTINE : Well , then , I 'll double your folly .
THURIO : How ?
SILVIA : What , angry , Sir Thurio ! do you change colour ?
VALENTINE : Give him leave , madam ; he is a kind of chameleon .
THURIO : That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air .
VALENTINE : You have said , sir .
THURIO : Ay , sir , and done too , for this time .
VALENTINE : I know it well , sir ; you always end ere you begin .
SILVIA : A fine volley of words , gentlemen , and quickly shot off .
VALENTINE : ' Tis indeed , madam ; we thank the giver .
SILVIA : Who is that , servant ?
VALENTINE : Yourself , sweet lady ; for you gave the fire . Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship 's looks , and spends what he borrows kindly in your company .
THURIO : Sir , if you spend word for word with me , I shall make your wit bankrupt .
VALENTINE : I know it well , sir ; you have an exchequer of words , and , I think , no other treasure to give your followers , for it appears by their bare liveries , that they live by your bare words .
SILVIA : No more , gentlemen , no more : --here comes my father . Enter DUKE
DUKE : Now , daughter Silvia , you are hard beset . Sir Valentine , your father 's in good health : What say you to a letter from your friends Of much good news ?
VALENTINE : My lord , I will be thankful . To any happy messenger from thence .
DUKE : Know ye Don Antonio , your countryman ?
