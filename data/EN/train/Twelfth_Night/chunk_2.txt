SIR ANDREW : Good Mistress Accost , I desire better acquaintance .
MARIA : My name is Mary , sir .
SIR ANDREW : Good Mistress Mary Accost , --
SIR TOBY BELCH : You mistake , knight ; ' accost ' is front her , board her , woo her , assail her .
SIR ANDREW : By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company . Is that the meaning of ' accost ' ?
MARIA : Fare you well , gentlemen .
SIR TOBY BELCH : An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
SIR ANDREW : An you part so , mistress , I would I might never draw sword again . Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
MARIA : Sir , I have not you by the hand .
SIR ANDREW : Marry , but you shall have ; and here 's my hand .
MARIA : Now , sir , ' thought is free : ' I pray you , bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink .
SIR ANDREW : Wherefore , sweet-heart ? what 's your metaphor ?
MARIA : It 's dry , sir .
SIR ANDREW : Why , I think so : I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry . But what 's your jest ?
MARIA : A dry jest , sir .
SIR ANDREW : Are you full of them ?
MARIA : Ay , sir , I have them at my fingers ' ends : marry , now I let go your hand , I am barren . Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH : O knight thou lackest a cup of canary : when did I see thee so put down ?
SIR ANDREW : Never in your life , I think ; unless you see canary put me down . Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has : but I am a great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit .
SIR TOBY BELCH : No question .
SIR ANDREW : An I thought that , I 'ld forswear it . I 'll ride home to-morrow , Sir Toby .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Pourquoi , my dear knight ?
SIR ANDREW : What is ' Pourquoi ' ? do or not do ? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing , dancing and bear-baiting : O , had I but followed the arts !
SIR TOBY BELCH : Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
SIR ANDREW : Why , would that have mended my hair ?
SIR TOBY BELCH : Past question ; for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
SIR ANDREW : But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
SIR TOBY BELCH : Excellent ; it hangs like flax on a distaff ; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off .
SIR ANDREW : Faith , I 'll home to-morrow , Sir Toby : your niece will not be seen ; or if she be , it 's four to one she 'll none of me : the count himself here hard by woos her .
SIR TOBY BELCH : She 'll none o ' the count : she 'll not match above her degree , neither in estate , years , nor wit ; I have heard her swear 't . Tut , there 's life in 't , man .
SIR ANDREW : I 'll stay a month longer . I am a fellow o ' the strangest mind i ' the world ; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
SIR ANDREW : As any man in Illyria , whatsoever he be , under the degree of my betters ; and yet I will not compare with an old man .
SIR TOBY BELCH : What is thy excellence in a galliard , knight ?
SIR ANDREW : Faith , I can cut a caper .
SIR TOBY BELCH : And I can cut the mutton to 't .
SIR ANDREW : And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria .
