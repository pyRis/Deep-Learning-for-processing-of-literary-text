MARIA : Get him to say his prayers , good Sir Toby , get him to pray .
MALVOLIO : My prayers , minx !
MARIA : No , I warrant you , he will not hear of godliness .
MALVOLIO : Go , hang yourselves all ! you are idle shallow things : I am not of your element : you shall know more hereafter . Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH : Is 't possible ?
FABIAN : If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
SIR TOBY BELCH : His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
MARIA : Nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
FABIAN : Why , we shall make him mad indeed .
MARIA : The house will be the quieter .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Come , we 'll have him in a dark room and bound . My niece is already in the belief that he 's mad : we may carry it thus , for our pleasure and his penance , till our very pastime , tired out of breath , prompt us to have mercy on him : at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen . But see , but see . Enter SIR ANDREW
FABIAN : More matter for a May morning .
SIR ANDREW : Here 's the challenge , read it : warrant there 's vinegar and pepper in 't .
FABIAN : Is 't so saucy ?
SIR ANDREW : Ay , is 't , I warrant him : do but read .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Give me . Reads ' Youth , whatsoever thou art , thou art but a scurvy fellow . ' 
FABIAN : Good , and valiant .
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' Wonder not , nor admire not in thy mind , why I do call thee so , for I will show thee no reason for 't . ' 
FABIAN : A good note ; that keeps you from the blow of the law .
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' Thou comest to the lady Olivia , and in my sight she uses thee kindly : but thou liest in thy throat ; that is not the matter I challenge thee for . ' 
FABIAN : Very brief , and to exceeding good sense--less .
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' I will waylay thee going home ; where if it be thy chance to kill me , ' --
FABIAN : Good .
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain . ' 
FABIAN : Still you keep o ' the windy side of the law : good .
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' Fare thee well ; and God have mercy upon one of our souls ! He may have mercy upon mine ; but my hope is better , and so look to thyself . Thy friend , as thou usest him , and thy sworn enemy , ANDREW AGUECHEEK . If this letter move him not , his legs cannot : I 'll give 't him .
MARIA : You may have very fit occasion for 't : he is now in some commerce with my lady , and will by and by depart .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Go , Sir Andrew : scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily : so soon as ever thou seest him , draw ; and , as thou drawest swear horrible ; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath , with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off , gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him . Away !
SIR ANDREW : Nay , let me alone for swearing . Exit
