VIOLA : My lord , I do protest--
OLIVIA : O , do not swear ! Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear . Enter SIR ANDREW
SIR ANDREW : For the love of God , a surgeon ! Send one presently to Sir Toby .
OLIVIA : What 's the matter ?
SIR ANDREW : He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too : for the love of God , your help ! I had rather than forty pound I were at home .
OLIVIA : Who has done this , Sir Andrew ?
SIR ANDREW : The count 's gentleman , one Cesario : we took him for a coward , but he 's the very devil incardinate .
DUKE ORSINO : My gentleman , Cesario ?
SIR ANDREW : ' Od 's lifelings , here he is ! You broke my head for nothing ; and that that I did , I was set on to do 't by Sir Toby .
VIOLA : Why do you speak to me ? I never hurt you : You drew your sword upon me without cause ; But I bespoke you fair , and hurt you not .
SIR ANDREW : If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me : I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb . Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown Here comes Sir Toby halting ; you shall hear more : but if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
DUKE ORSINO : How now , gentleman ! how is 't with you ?
SIR TOBY BELCH : That 's all one : has hurt me , and there 's the end on 't . Sot , didst see Dick surgeon , sot ?
Clown : O , he 's drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone ; his eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Then he 's a rogue , and a passy measures panyn : I hate a drunken rogue .
OLIVIA : Away with him ! Who hath made this havoc with them ?
SIR ANDREW : I 'll help you , Sir Toby , because well be dressed together .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Will you help ? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave , a thin-faced knave , a gull !
OLIVIA : Get him to bed , and let his hurt be look 'd to . Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN : I am sorry , madam , I have hurt your kinsman : But , had it been the brother of my blood , I must have done no less with wit and safety . You throw a strange regard upon me , and by that I do perceive it hath offended you : Pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows We made each other but so late ago .
DUKE ORSINO : One face , one voice , one habit , and two persons , A natural perspective , that is and is not !
SEBASTIAN : Antonio , O my dear Antonio ! How have the hours rack 'd and tortured me , Since I have lost thee !
ANTONIO : Sebastian are you ?
SEBASTIAN : Fear 'st thou that , Antonio ?
ANTONIO : How have you made division of yourself ? An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures . Which is Sebastian ?
OLIVIA : Most wonderful !
SEBASTIAN : Do I stand there ? I never had a brother ; Nor can there be that deity in my nature , Of here and every where . I had a sister , Whom the blind waves and surges have devour 'd . Of charity , what kin are you to me ? What countryman ? what name ? what parentage ?
VIOLA : Of Messaline : Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb : If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us .
SEBASTIAN : A spirit I am indeed ; But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate . Were you a woman , as the rest goes even , I should my tears let fall upon your cheek , And say ' Thrice-welcome , drowned Viola ! '
