SIR TOBY BELCH : What wilt thou do ?
MARIA : I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love ; wherein , by the colour of his beard , the shape of his leg , the manner of his gait , the expressure of his eye , forehead , and complexion , he shall find himself most feelingly personated . I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Excellent ! I smell a device .
SIR ANDREW : I have 't in my nose too .
SIR TOBY BELCH : He shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she 's in love with him .
MARIA : My purpose is , indeed , a horse of that colour .
SIR ANDREW : And your horse now would make him an ass .
MARIA : Ass , I doubt not .
SIR ANDREW : O , ' twill be admirable !
MARIA : Sport royal , I warrant you : I know my physic will work with him . I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter : observe his construction of it . For this night , to bed , and dream on the event . Farewell . Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH : Good night , Penthesilea .
SIR ANDREW : Before me , she 's a good wench .
SIR TOBY BELCH : She 's a beagle , true-bred , and one that adores me : what o ' that ?
SIR ANDREW : I was adored once too .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Let 's to bed , knight . Thou hadst need send for more money .
SIR ANDREW : If I cannot recover your niece , I am a foul way out .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Send for money , knight : if thou hast her not i ' the end , call me cut .
SIR ANDREW : If I do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Come , come , I 'll go burn some sack ; ' tis too late to go to bed now : come , knight ; come , knight . Enter DUKE ORSINO , VIOLA , CURIO , and others
DUKE ORSINO : Give me some music . Now , good morrow , friends . Now , good Cesario , but that piece of song , That old and antique song we heard last night : Methought it did relieve my passion much , More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times : Come , but one verse .
CURIO : He is not here , so please your lordship that should sing it .
DUKE ORSINO : Who was it ?
CURIO : Feste , the jester , my lord ; a fool that the lady Olivia 's father took much delight in . He is about the house .
DUKE ORSINO : Seek him out , and play the tune the while . Exit CURIO . Music plays Come hither , boy : if ever thou shalt love , In the sweet pangs of it remember me ; For such as I am all true lovers are , Unstaid and skittish in all motions else , Save in the constant image of the creature That is beloved . How dost thou like this tune ?
VIOLA : It gives a very echo to the seat Where Love is throned .
DUKE ORSINO : Thou dost speak masterly : My life upon 't , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay 'd upon some favour that it loves : Hath it not , boy ?
VIOLA : A little , by your favour .
DUKE ORSINO : What kind of woman is 't ?
VIOLA : Of your complexion .
DUKE ORSINO : She is not worth thee , then . What years , i ' faith ?
VIOLA : About your years , my lord .
