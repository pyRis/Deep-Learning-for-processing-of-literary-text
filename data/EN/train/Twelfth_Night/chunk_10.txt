SIR TOBY BELCH : ' O , the twelfth day of December , ' --
MARIA : For the love o ' God , peace ! Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO : My masters , are you mad ? or what are you ? Have ye no wit , manners , nor honesty , but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ? Do ye make an alehouse of my lady 's house , that ye squeak out your coziers ' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice ? Is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
SIR TOBY BELCH : We did keep time , sir , in our catches . Sneck up !
MALVOLIO : Sir Toby , I must be round with you . My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbours you as her kinsman , she 's nothing allied to your disorders . If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house ; if not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' Farewell , dear heart , since I must needs be gone . ' 
MARIA : Nay , good Sir Toby .
Clown : ' His eyes do show his days are almost done . ' 
MALVOLIO : Is 't even so ?
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' But I will never die . ' 
Clown : Sir Toby , there you lie .
MALVOLIO : This is much credit to you .
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' Shall I bid him go ? '
Clown : ' What an if you do ? '
SIR TOBY BELCH : ' Shall I bid him go , and spare not ? '
Clown : ' O no , no , no , no , you dare not . ' 
SIR TOBY BELCH : Out o ' tune , sir : ye lie . Art any more than a steward ? Dost thou think , because thou art virtuous , there shall be no more cakes and ale ?
Clown : Yes , by Saint Anne , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Thou 'rt i ' the right . Go , sir , rub your chain with crumbs . A stoup of wine , Maria !
MALVOLIO : Mistress Mary , if you prized my lady 's favour at any thing more than contempt , you would not give means for this uncivil rule : she shall know of it , by this hand . Exit
MARIA : Go shake your ears .
SIR ANDREW : ' Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man 's a-hungry , to challenge him the field , and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Do 't , knight : I 'll write thee a challenge : or I 'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
MARIA : Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight : since the youth of the count 's was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet . For Monsieur Malvolio , let me alone with him : if I do not gull him into a nayword , and make him a common recreation , do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed : I know I can do it .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Possess us , possess us ; tell us something of him .
MARIA : Marry , sir , sometimes he is a kind of puritan .
SIR ANDREW : O , if I thought that I 'ld beat him like a dog !
SIR TOBY BELCH : What , for being a puritan ? thy exquisite reason , dear knight ?
SIR ANDREW : I have no exquisite reason for 't , but I have reason good enough .
