DUKE ORSINO : But died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
VIOLA : I am all the daughters of my father 's house , And all the brothers too : and yet I know not . Sir , shall I to this lady ?
DUKE ORSINO : Ay , that 's the theme . To her in haste ; give her this jewel ; say , My love can give no place , bide no denay . Enter SIR TOBY BELCH , SIR ANDREW , and FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH : Come thy ways , Signior Fabian .
FABIAN : Nay , I 'll come : if I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame ?
FABIAN : I would exult , man : you know , he brought me out o ' favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
SIR TOBY BELCH : To anger him we 'll have the bear again ; and we will fool him black and blue : shall we not , Sir Andrew ?
SIR ANDREW : An we do not , it is pity of our lives .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Here comes the little villain . Enter MARIA How now , my metal of India !
MARIA : Get ye all three into the box-tree : Malvolio 's coming down this walk : he has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour : observe him , for the love of mockery ; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him . Close , in the name of jesting ! Lie thou there , Throws down a letter for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling . Exit Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO : ' Tis but fortune ; all is fortune . Maria once told me she did affect me : and I have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion . Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that follows her . What should I think on 't ?
SIR TOBY BELCH : Here 's an overweening rogue !
FABIAN : O , peace ! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him : how he jets under his advanced plumes !
SIR ANDREW : ' Slight , I could so beat the rogue !
SIR TOBY BELCH : Peace , I say .
MALVOLIO : To be Count Malvolio !
SIR TOBY BELCH : Ah , rogue !
SIR ANDREW : Pistol him , pistol him .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Peace , peace !
MALVOLIO : There is example for 't ; the lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
SIR ANDREW : Fie on him , Jezebel !
FABIAN : O , peace ! now he 's deeply in : look how imagination blows him .
MALVOLIO : Having been three months married to her , sitting in my state , --
SIR TOBY BELCH : O , for a stone-bow , to hit him in the eye !
MALVOLIO : Calling my officers about me , in my branched velvet gown ; having come from a day-bed , where I have left Olivia sleeping , --
SIR TOBY BELCH : Fire and brimstone !
FABIAN : O , peace , peace !
MALVOLIO : And then to have the humour of state ; and after a demure travel of regard , telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs , to for my kinsman Toby , --
SIR TOBY BELCH : Bolts and shackles !
FABIAN : O peace , peace , peace ! now , now .
MALVOLIO : Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him : I frown the while ; and perchance wind up watch , or play with my--some rich jewel . Toby approaches ; courtesies there to me , --
SIR TOBY BELCH : Shall this fellow live ?
FABIAN : Though our silence be drawn from us with cars , yet peace .
MALVOLIO : I extend my hand to him thus , quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control , --
