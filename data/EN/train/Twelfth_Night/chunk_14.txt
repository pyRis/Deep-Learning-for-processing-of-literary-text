MALVOLIO : Saying , ' Cousin Toby , my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech , ' --
SIR TOBY BELCH : What , what ?
MALVOLIO : ' You must amend your drunkenness . ' 
SIR TOBY BELCH : Out , scab !
FABIAN : Nay , patience , or we break the sinews of our plot .
MALVOLIO : ' Besides , you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight , ' --
SIR ANDREW : That 's me , I warrant you .
MALVOLIO : ' One Sir Andrew , ' --
SIR ANDREW : I knew ' twas I ; for many do call me fool .
MALVOLIO : What employment have we here ? Taking up the letter
FABIAN : Now is the woodcock near the gin .
SIR TOBY BELCH : O , peace ! and the spirit of humour intimate reading aloud to him !
MALVOLIO : By my life , this is my lady 's hand these be her very C 's , her U 's and her T 's and thus makes she her great P 's . It is , in contempt of question , her hand .
SIR ANDREW : Her C 's , her U 's and her T 's : why that ?
MALVOLIO : ' To the unknown beloved , this , and my good wishes : ' --her very phrases ! By your leave , wax . Soft ! and the impressure her Lucrece , with which she uses to seal : ' tis my lady . To whom should this be ?
FABIAN : This wins him , liver and all .
MALVOLIO : Jove knows I love : But who ? Lips , do not move ; No man must know . ' No man must know . ' What follows ? the numbers altered ! ' No man must know : ' if this should be thee , Malvolio ?
SIR TOBY BELCH : Marry , hang thee , brock !
MALVOLIO : I may command where I adore ; But silence , like a Lucrece knife , With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore : M , O , A , I , doth sway my life .
FABIAN : A fustian riddle !
SIR TOBY BELCH : Excellent wench , say I.
MALVOLIO : ' M , O , A , I , doth sway my life . ' Nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
FABIAN : What dish o ' poison has she dressed him !
SIR TOBY BELCH : And with what wing the staniel cheques at it !
MALVOLIO : ' I may command where I adore . ' Why , she may command me : I serve her ; she is my lady . Why , this is evident to any formal capacity ; there is no obstruction in this : and the end , --what should that alphabetical position portend ? If I could make that resemble something in me , --Softly ! M , O , A , I , --
SIR TOBY BELCH : O , ay , make up that : he is now at a cold scent .
FABIAN : Sowter will cry upon 't for all this , though it be as rank as a fox .
MALVOLIO : M , --Malvolio ; M , --why , that begins my name .
FABIAN : Did not I say he would work it out ? the cur is excellent at faults .
MALVOLIO : M , --but then there is no consonancy in the sequel ; that suffers under probation A should follow but O does .
FABIAN : And O shall end , I hope .
SIR TOBY BELCH : Ay , or I 'll cudgel him , and make him cry O !
MALVOLIO : And then I comes behind .
FABIAN : Ay , an you had any eye behind you , you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you .
