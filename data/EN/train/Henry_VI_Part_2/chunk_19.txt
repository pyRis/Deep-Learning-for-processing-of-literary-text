First Murderer : Run to my Lord of Suffolk ; let him know We have dispatch 'd the duke , as he commanded .
Second Murderer : O that it were to do ! What have we done ? Didst ever hear a man so penitent ? Enter SUFFOLK
First Murder : Here comes my lord .
SUFFOLK : Now , sirs , have you dispatch 'd this thing ?
First Murderer : Ay , my good lord , he 's dead .
SUFFOLK : Why , that 's well said . Go , get you to my house ; I will reward you for this venturous deed . The king and all the peers are here at hand . Have you laid fair the bed ? Is all things well , According as I gave directions ?
First Murderer : ' Tis , my good lord .
SUFFOLK : Away ! be gone . Sound trumpets . Enter KING HENRY VI , QUEEN MARGARET , CARDINAL , SOMERSET , with Attendants
KING HENRY VI : Go , call our uncle to our presence straight ; Say we intend to try his grace to-day . If he be guilty , as ' tis published .
SUFFOLK : I 'll call him presently , my noble lord . Exit
KING HENRY VI : Lords , take your places ; and , I pray you all , Proceed no straiter ' gainst our uncle Gloucester Than from true evidence of good esteem He be approved in practise culpable .
QUEEN MARGARET : God forbid any malice should prevail , That faultless may condemn a nobleman ! Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion !
KING HENRY VI : I thank thee , Meg ; these words content me much . Re-enter SUFFOLK How now ! why look 'st thou pale ? why tremblest thou ? Where is our uncle ? what 's the matter , Suffolk ?
SUFFOLK : Dead in his bed , my lord ; Gloucester is dead .
QUEEN MARGARET : Marry , God forfend !
CARDINAL : God 's secret judgment : I did dream to-night The duke was dumb and could not speak a word . KING HENRY VI swoons
QUEEN MARGARET : How fares my lord ? Help , lords ! the king is dead .
SOMERSET : Rear up his body ; wring him by the nose .
QUEEN MARGARET : Run , go , help , help ! O Henry , ope thine eyes !
SUFFOLK : He doth revive again : madam , be patient .
KING HENRY VI : O heavenly God !
QUEEN MARGARET : How fares my gracious lord ?
SUFFOLK : Comfort , my sovereign ! gracious Henry , comfort !
KING HENRY VI : What , doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me ? Came he right now to sing a raven 's note , Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers ; And thinks he that the chirping of a wren , By crying comfort from a hollow breast , Can chase away the first-conceived sound ? Hide not thy poison with such sugar 'd words ; Lay not thy hands on me ; forbear , I say ; Their touch affrights me as a serpent 's sting . Thou baleful messenger , out of my sight ! Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny Sits in grim majesty , to fright the world . Look not upon me , for thine eyes are wounding : Yet do not go away : come , basilisk , And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight ; For in the shade of death I shall find joy ; In life but double death , now Gloucester 's dead .
