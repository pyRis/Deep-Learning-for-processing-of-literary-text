Herald : I summon your grace to his majesty 's parliament , Holden at Bury the first of this next month .
GLOUCESTER : And my consent ne 'er ask 'd herein before ! This is close dealing . Well , I will be there . Exit Herald My Nell , I take my leave : and , master sheriff , Let not her penance exceed the king 's commission .
Sheriff : An 't please your grace , here my commission stays , And Sir John Stanley is appointed now To take her with him to the Isle of Man .
GLOUCESTER : Must you , Sir John , protect my lady here ?
STANLEY : So am I given in charge , may 't please your grace .
GLOUCESTER : Entreat her not the worse in that I pray You use her well : the world may laugh again ; And I may live to do you kindness if You do it her : and so , Sir John , farewell !
DUCHESS : What , gone , my lord , and bid me not farewell !
GLOUCESTER : Witness my tears , I cannot stay to speak .
DUCHESS : Art thou gone too ? all comfort go with thee ! For none abides with me : my joy is death ; Death , at whose name I oft have been afear 'd , Because I wish 'd this world 's eternity . Stanley , I prithee , go , and take me hence ; I care not whither , for I beg no favour , Only convey me where thou art commanded .
STANLEY : Why , madam , that is to the Isle of Man ; There to be used according to your state .
DUCHESS : That 's bad enough , for I am but reproach : And shall I then be used reproachfully ?
STANLEY : Like to a duchess , and Duke Humphrey 's lady ; According to that state you shall be used .
DUCHESS : Sheriff , farewell , and better than I fare , Although thou hast been conduct of my shame .
Sheriff : It is my office ; and , madam , pardon me .
DUCHESS : Ay , ay , farewell ; thy office is discharged . Come , Stanley , shall we go ?
STANLEY : Madam , your penance done , throw off this sheet , And go we to attire you for our journey .
DUCHESS : My shame will not be shifted with my sheet : No , it will hang upon my richest robes And show itself , attire me how I can . Go , lead the way ; I long to see my prison . Sound a sennet . Enter KING HENRY VI , QUEEN MARGARET , CARDINAL , SUFFOLK , YORK , BUCKINGHAM , SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament
KING HENRY VI : I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come : ' Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man , Whate 'er occasion keeps him from us now .
