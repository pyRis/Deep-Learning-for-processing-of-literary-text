KING HENRY VI : But what a point , my lord , your falcon made , And what a pitch she flew above the rest ! To see how God in all his creatures works ! Yea , man and birds are fain of climbing high .
SUFFOLK : No marvel , an it like your majesty , My lord protector 's hawks do tower so well ; They know their master loves to be aloft , And bears his thoughts above his falcon 's pitch .
GLOUCESTER : My lord , ' tis but a base ignoble mind That mounts no higher than a bird can soar .
CARDINAL : I thought as much ; he would be above the clouds .
GLOUCESTER : Ay , my lord cardinal ? how think you by that ? Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven ?
KING HENRY VI : The treasury of everlasting joy .
CARDINAL : Thy heaven is on earth ; thine eyes and thoughts Beat on a crown , the treasure of thy heart ; Pernicious protector , dangerous peer , That smooth 'st it so with king and commonweal !
GLOUCESTER : What , cardinal , is your priesthood grown peremptory ? Tantaene animis coelestibus irae ? Churchmen so hot ? good uncle , hide such malice ; With such holiness can you do it ?
SUFFOLK : No malice , sir ; no more than well becomes So good a quarrel and so bad a peer .
GLOUCESTER : As who , my lord ?
SUFFOLK : Why , as you , my lord , An 't like your lordly lord-protectorship .
GLOUCESTER : Why , Suffolk , England knows thine insolence .
QUEEN MARGARET : And thy ambition , Gloucester .
KING HENRY VI : I prithee , peace , good queen , And whet not on these furious peers ; For blessed are the peacemakers on earth .
CARDINAL : Let me be blessed for the peace I make , Against this proud protector , with my sword !
GLOUCESTER : Faith , holy uncle , would ' twere come to that !
CARDINAL : Marry , when thou darest .
GLOUCESTER : Make up no factious numbers for the matter ; In thine own person answer thy abuse .
CARDINAL : Ay , where thou darest not peep : an if thou darest , This evening , on the east side of the grove .
KING HENRY VI : How now , my lords !
CARDINAL : Believe me , cousin Gloucester , Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly , We had had more sport . Aside to GLOUCESTER Come with thy two-hand sword .
GLOUCESTER : True , uncle .
CARDINAL : Are ye advised ? the east side of the grove ?
GLOUCESTER : Cardinal , I am with you .
KING HENRY VI : Why , how now , uncle Gloucester !
GLOUCESTER : Talking of hawking ; nothing else , my lord . Aside to CARDINAL Now , by God 's mother , priest , I 'll shave your crown for this , Or all my fence shall fail .
CARDINAL : Medice , teipsum-- Protector , see to 't well , protect yourself .
KING HENRY VI : The winds grow high ; so do your stomachs , lords . How irksome is this music to my heart ! When such strings jar , what hope of harmony ? I pray , my lords , let me compound this strife . Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban 's , crying ' A miracle ! '
GLOUCESTER : What means this noise ? Fellow , what miracle dost thou proclaim ?
Townsman : A miracle ! a miracle !
SUFFOLK : Come to the king and tell him what miracle .
Townsman : Forsooth , a blind man at Saint Alban 's shrine , Within this half-hour , hath received his sight ; A man that ne 'er saw in his life before .
KING HENRY VI : Now , God be praised , that to believing souls Gives light in darkness , comfort in despair ! Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban 's and his brethren , bearing SIMPCOX , between two in a chair , SIMPCOX 's Wife following
CARDINAL : Here comes the townsmen on procession , To present your highness with the man .
