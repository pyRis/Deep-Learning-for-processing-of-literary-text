QUEEN MARGARET : Nay , then , this spark will prove a raging fire , If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with : No more , good York ; sweet Somerset , be still : Thy fortune , York , hadst thou been regent there , Might happily have proved far worse than his .
YORK : What , worse than nought ? nay , then , a shame take all !
SOMERSET : And , in the number , thee that wishest shame !
CARDINAL : My Lord of York , try what your fortune is . The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms And temper clay with blood of Englishmen : To Ireland will you lead a band of men , Collected choicely , from each county some , And try your hap against the Irishmen ?
YORK : I will , my lord , so please his majesty .
SUFFOLK : Why , our authority is his consent , And what we do establish he confirms : Then , noble York , take thou this task in hand .
YORK : I am content : provide me soldiers , lords , Whiles I take order for mine own affairs .
SUFFOLK : A charge , Lord York , that I will see perform 'd . But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey .
CARDINAL : No more of him ; for I will deal with him That henceforth he shall trouble us no more . And so break off ; the day is almost spent : Lord Suffolk , you and I must talk of that event .
YORK : My Lord of Suffolk , within fourteen days At Bristol I expect my soldiers ; For there I 'll ship them all for Ireland .
SUFFOLK : I 'll see it truly done , my Lord of York .
