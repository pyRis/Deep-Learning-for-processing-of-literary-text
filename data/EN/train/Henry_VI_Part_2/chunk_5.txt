SUFFOLK : Madam , myself have limed a bush for her , And placed a quire of such enticing birds , That she will light to listen to the lays , And never mount to trouble you again . So , let her rest : and , madam , list to me ; For I am bold to counsel you in this . Although we fancy not the cardinal , Yet must we join with him and with the lords , Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace . As for the Duke of York , this late complaint Will make but little for his benefit . So , one by one , we 'll weed them all at last , And you yourself shall steer the happy helm . Sound a sennet . Enter KING HENRY VI , GLOUCESTER , CARDINAL , BUCKINGHAM , YORK , SOMERSET , SALISBURY , WARWICK , and the DUCHESS
KING HENRY VI : For my part , noble lords , I care not which ; Or Somerset or York , all 's one to me .
YORK : If York have ill demean 'd himself in France , Then let him be denay 'd the regentship .
SOMERSET : If Somerset be unworthy of the place , Let York be regent ; I will yield to him .
WARWICK : Whether your grace be worthy , yea or no , Dispute not that : York is the worthier .
CARDINAL : Ambitious Warwick , let thy betters speak .
WARWICK : The cardinal 's not my better in the field .
BUCKINGHAM : All in this presence are thy betters , Warwick .
WARWICK : Warwick may live to be the best of all .
SALISBURY : Peace , son ! and show some reason , Buckingham , Why Somerset should be preferred in this .
QUEEN MARGARET : Because the king , forsooth , will have it so .
GLOUCESTER : Madam , the king is old enough himself To give his censure : these are no women 's matters .
QUEEN MARGARET : If he be old enough , what needs your grace To be protector of his excellence ?
GLOUCESTER : Madam , I am protector of the realm ; And , at his pleasure , will resign my place .
SUFFOLK : Resign it then and leave thine insolence . Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou ? -- The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck ; The Dauphin hath prevail 'd beyond the seas ; And all the peers and nobles of the realm Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty .
CARDINAL : The commons hast thou rack 'd ; the clergy 's bags Are lank and lean with thy extortions .
SOMERSET : Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife 's attire Have cost a mass of public treasury .
BUCKINGHAM : Thy cruelty in execution Upon offenders , hath exceeded law , And left thee to the mercy of the law .
QUEEN MARGARET : They sale of offices and towns in France , If they were known , as the suspect is great , Would make thee quickly hop without thy head . Exit GLOUCESTER . QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan Give me my fan : what , minion ! can ye not ? She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear I cry you mercy , madam ; was it you ?
DUCHESS : Was 't I ! yea , I it was , proud Frenchwoman : Could I come near your beauty with my nails , I 'd set my ten commandments in your face .
KING HENRY VI : Sweet aunt , be quiet ; ' twas against her will .
DUCHESS : Against her will ! good king , look to 't in time ; She 'll hamper thee , and dandle thee like a baby : Though in this place most master wear no breeches , She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged . Exit
BUCKINGHAM : Lord cardinal , I will follow Eleanor , And listen after Humphrey , how he proceeds : She 's tickled now ; her fume needs no spurs , She 'll gallop far enough to her destruction . Exit Re-enter GLOUCESTER
