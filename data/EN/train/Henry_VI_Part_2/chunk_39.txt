YOUNG CLIFFORD : But that my heart 's on future mischief set , I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly : But fly you must ; uncurable discomfit Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts . Away , for your relief ! and we will live To see their day and them our fortune give : Away , my lord , away ! Alarum . Retreat . Enter YORK , RICHARD , WARWICK , and Soldiers , with drum and colours
YORK : Of Salisbury , who can report of him , That winter lion , who in rage forgets Aged contusions and all brush of time , And , like a gallant in the brow of youth , Repairs him with occasion ? This happy day Is not itself , nor have we won one foot , If Salisbury be lost .
RICHARD : My noble father , Three times to-day I holp him to his horse , Three times bestrid him ; thrice I led him off , Persuaded him from any further act : But still , where danger was , still there I met him ; And like rich hangings in a homely house , So was his will in his old feeble body . But , noble as he is , look where he comes . Enter SALISBURY
SALISBURY : Now , by my sword , well hast thou fought to-day ; By the mass , so did we all . I thank you , Richard : God knows how long it is I have to live ; And it hath pleased him that three times to-day You have defended me from imminent death . Well , lords , we have not got that which we have : ' Tis not enough our foes are this time fled , Being opposites of such repairing nature .
YORK : I know our safety is to follow them ; For , as I hear , the king is fled to London , To call a present court of parliament . Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth . What says Lord Warwick ? shall we after them ?
