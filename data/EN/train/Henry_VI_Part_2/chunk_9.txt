GLOUCESTER : Stand by , my masters : bring him near the king ; His highness ' pleasure is to talk with him .
KING HENRY VI : Good fellow , tell us here the circumstance , That we for thee may glorify the Lord . What , hast thou been long blind and now restored ?
SIMPCOX : Born blind , an 't please your grace .
Wife : Ay , indeed , was he .
SUFFOLK : What woman is this ?
Wife : His wife , an 't like your worship .
GLOUCESTER : Hadst thou been his mother , thou couldst have better told .
KING HENRY VI : Where wert thou born ?
SIMPCOX : At Berwick in the north , an 't like your grace .
KING HENRY VI : Poor soul , God 's goodness hath been great to thee : Let never day nor night unhallow 'd pass , But still remember what the Lord hath done .
QUEEN MARGARET : Tell me , good fellow , camest thou here by chance , Or of devotion , to this holy shrine ?
SIMPCOX : God knows , of pure devotion ; being call 'd A hundred times and oftener , in my sleep , By good Saint Alban ; who said , ' Simpcox , come , Come , offer at my shrine , and I will help thee . ' 
Wife : Most true , forsooth ; and many time and oft Myself have heard a voice to call him so .
CARDINAL : What , art thou lame ?
SIMPCOX : Ay , God Almighty help me !
SUFFOLK : How camest thou so ?
SIMPCOX : A fall off of a tree .
Wife : A plum-tree , master .
GLOUCESTER : How long hast thou been blind ?
SIMPCOX : Born so , master .
GLOUCESTER : What , and wouldst climb a tree ?
SIMPCOX : But that in all my life , when I was a youth .
Wife : Too true ; and bought his climbing very dear .
GLOUCESTER : Mass , thou lovedst plums well , that wouldst venture so .
SIMPCOX : Alas , good master , my wife desired some damsons , And made me climb , with danger of my life .
GLOUCESTER : A subtle knave ! but yet it shall not serve . Let me see thine eyes : wink now : now open them : In my opinion yet thou seest not well .
SIMPCOX : Yes , master , clear as day , I thank God and Saint Alban .
GLOUCESTER : Say 'st thou me so ? What colour is this cloak of ?
SIMPCOX : Red , master ; red as blood .
GLOUCESTER : Why , that 's well said . What colour is my gown of ?
SIMPCOX : Black , forsooth : coal-black as jet .
KING HENRY VI : Why , then , thou know 'st what colour jet is of ?
SUFFOLK : And yet , I think , jet did he never see .
GLOUCESTER : But cloaks and gowns , before this day , a many .
Wife : Never , before this day , in all his life .
GLOUCESTER : Tell me , sirrah , what 's my name ?
SIMPCOX : Alas , master , I know not .
GLOUCESTER : What 's his name ?
SIMPCOX : I know not .
GLOUCESTER : Nor his ?
SIMPCOX : No , indeed , master .
GLOUCESTER : What 's thine own name ?
SIMPCOX : Saunder Simpcox , an if it please you , master .
GLOUCESTER : Then , Saunder , sit there , the lyingest knave in Christendom . If thou hadst been born blind , thou mightest as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear . Sight may distinguish of colours , but suddenly to nominate them all , it is impossible . My lords , Saint Alban here hath done a miracle ; and would ye not think his cunning to be great , that could restore this cripple to his legs again ?
SIMPCOX : O master , that you could !
GLOUCESTER : My masters of Saint Alban 's , have you not beadles in your town , and things called whips ?
Mayor : Yes , my lord , if it please your grace .
GLOUCESTER : Then send for one presently .
