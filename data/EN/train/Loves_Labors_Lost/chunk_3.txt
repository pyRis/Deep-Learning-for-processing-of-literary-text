FERDINAND : ' with a child of our grandmother Eve , a female ; or , for thy more sweet understanding , a woman . Him I , as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on , have sent to thee , to receive the meed of punishment , by thy sweet grace 's officer , Anthony Dull ; a man of good repute , carriage , bearing , and estimation . ' 
DULL : ' Me , an 't shall please you ; I am Anthony Dull .
FERDINAND : ' For Jaquenetta , --so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain , --I keep her as a vessel of the law 's fury ; and shall , at the least of thy sweet notice , bring her to trial . Thine , in all compliments of devoted and heart-burning heat of duty . DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO . ' 
BIRON : This is not so well as I looked for , but the best that ever I heard .
FERDINAND : Ay , the best for the worst . But , sirrah , what say you to this ?
COSTARD : Sir , I confess the wench .
FERDINAND : Did you hear the proclamation ?
COSTARD : I do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of it .
FERDINAND : It was proclaimed a year 's imprisonment , to be taken with a wench .
COSTARD : I was taken with none , sir : I was taken with a damsel .
FERDINAND : Well , it was proclaimed ' damsel . ' 
COSTARD : This was no damsel , neither , sir ; she was a virgin .
FERDINAND : It is so varied , too ; for it was proclaimed ' virgin . ' 
COSTARD : If it were , I deny her virginity : I was taken with a maid .
FERDINAND : This maid will not serve your turn , sir .
COSTARD : This maid will serve my turn , sir .
FERDINAND : Sir , I will pronounce your sentence : you shall fast a week with bran and water .
COSTARD : I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge .
FERDINAND : And Don Armado shall be your keeper . My Lord Biron , see him deliver 'd o 'er : And go we , lords , to put in practise that Which each to other hath so strongly sworn .
BIRON : I 'll lay my head to any good man 's hat , These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn . Sirrah , come on .
COSTARD : I suffer for the truth , sir ; for true it is , I was taken with Jaquenetta , and Jaquenetta is a true girl ; and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity ! Affliction may one day smile again ; and till then , sit thee down , sorrow ! LOVE 'S LABOURS LOST Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH DON

MOTH : A great sign , sir , that he will look sad . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Why , sadness is one and the self-same thing , dear imp .
MOTH : No , no ; O Lord , sir , no . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : How canst thou part sadness and melancholy , my tender juvenal ?
MOTH : By a familiar demonstration of the working , my tough senior . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Why tough senior ? why tough senior ?
MOTH : Why tender juvenal ? why tender juvenal ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I spoke it , tender juvenal , as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days , which we may nominate tender .
MOTH : And I , tough senior , as an appertinent title to your old time , which we may name tough . DON ADRIANO DE
ARMADO : Pretty and apt .
MOTH : How mean you , sir ? I pretty , and my saying apt ? or I apt , and my saying pretty ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Thou pretty , because little .
MOTH : Little pretty , because little . Wherefore apt ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : And therefore apt , because quick .
