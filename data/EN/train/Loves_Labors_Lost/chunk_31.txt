PRINCESS : Great thanks , great Pompey .
COSTARD : ' Tis not so much worth ; but I hope I was perfect : I made a little fault in ' Great . ' 
BIRON : My hat to a halfpenny , Pompey proves the best Worthy . Enter SIR NATHANIEL , for Alexander
SIR NATHANIEL : When in the world I lived , I was the world 's commander ; By east , west , north , and south , I spread my conquering might : My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander , --
BOYET : Your nose says , no , you are not for it stands too right .
BIRON : Your nose smells ' no ' in this , most tender-smelling knight .
PRINCESS : The conqueror is dismay 'd . Proceed , good Alexander .
SIR NATHANIEL : When in the world I lived , I was the world 's commander , --
BOYET : Most true , ' tis right ; you were so , Alisander .
BIRON : Pompey the Great , --
COSTARD : Your servant , and Costard .
BIRON : Take away the conqueror , take away Alisander .
COSTARD : O , sir , you have overthrown Alisander the conqueror ! You will be scraped out of the painted cloth for this : your lion , that holds his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool , will be given to Ajax : he will be the ninth Worthy . A conqueror , and afeard to speak ! run away for shame , Alisander . SIR NATHANIEL retires There , an 't shall please you ; a foolish mild man ; an honest man , look you , and soon dashed . He is a marvellous good neighbour , faith , and a very good bowler : but , for Alisander , --alas , you see how ' tis , --a little o 'erparted . But there are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort . Enter HOLOFERNES , for Judas ; and MOTH , for Hercules
HOLOFERNES : Great Hercules is presented by this imp , Whose club kill 'd Cerberus , that three-headed canis ; And when he was a babe , a child , a shrimp , Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus . Quoniam he seemeth in minority , Ergo I come with this apology . Keep some state in thy exit , and vanish . MOTH retires Judas I am , --
DUMAIN : A Judas !
HOLOFERNES : Not Iscariot , sir . Judas I am , ycliped Maccabaeus .
DUMAIN : Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas .
BIRON : A kissing traitor . How art thou proved Judas ?
HOLOFERNES : Judas I am , --
DUMAIN : The more shame for you , Judas .
HOLOFERNES : What mean you , sir ?
BOYET : To make Judas hang himself .
HOLOFERNES : Begin , sir ; you are my elder .
BIRON : Well followed : Judas was hanged on an elder .
HOLOFERNES : I will not be put out of countenance .
BIRON : Because thou hast no face .
HOLOFERNES : What is this ?
BOYET : A cittern-head .
DUMAIN : The head of a bodkin .
BIRON : A Death 's face in a ring .
LONGAVILLE : The face of an old Roman coin , scarce seen .
BOYET : The pommel of Caesar 's falchion .
DUMAIN : The carved-bone face on a flask .
BIRON : Saint George 's half-cheek in a brooch .
DUMAIN : Ay , and in a brooch of lead .
BIRON : Ay , and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer . And now forward ; for we have put thee in countenance .
HOLOFERNES : You have put me out of countenance .
BIRON : False ; we have given thee faces .
HOLOFERNES : But you have out-faced them all .
BIRON : An thou wert a lion , we would do so .
BOYET : Therefore , as he is an ass , let him go . And so adieu , sweet Jude ! nay , why dost thou stay ?
DUMAIN : For the latter end of his name .
BIRON : For the ass to the Jude ; give it him : --Jud-as , away !
HOLOFERNES : This is not generous , not gentle , not humble .
