MOTH : I will praise an eel with the same praise . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : What , that an eel is ingenious ?
MOTH : That an eel is quick . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I do say thou art quick in answers : thou heatest my blood .
MOTH : I am answered , sir . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I love not to be crossed .
MOTH : He speaks the mere contrary ; crosses love not him . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I have promised to study three years with the duke .
MOTH : You may do it in an hour , sir . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Impossible .
MOTH : How many is one thrice told ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I am ill at reckoning ; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster .
MOTH : You are a gentleman and a gamester , sir . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I confess both : they are both the varnish of a complete man .
MOTH : Then , I am sure , you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : It doth amount to one more than two .
MOTH : Which the base vulgar do call three . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : True .
MOTH : Why , sir , is this such a piece of study ? Now here is three studied , ere ye 'll thrice wink : and how easy it is to put ' years ' to the word ' three , ' and study three years in two words , the dancing horse will tell you . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : A most fine figure !
MOTH : To prove you a cipher . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I will hereupon confess I am in love : and as it is base for a soldier to love , so am I in love with a base wench . If drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it , I would take Desire prisoner , and ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised courtesy . I think scorn to sigh : methinks I should outswear Cupid . Comfort , me , boy : what great men have been in love ?
MOTH : Hercules , master . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Most sweet Hercules ! More authority , dear boy , name more ; and , sweet my child , let them be men of good repute and carriage .
MOTH : Samson , master : he was a man of good carriage , great carriage , for he carried the town-gates on his back like a porter : and he was in love . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : O well-knit Samson ! strong-jointed Samson ! I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates . I am in love too . Who was Samson 's love , my dear Moth ?
MOTH : A woman , master . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Of what complexion ?
MOTH : Of all the four , or the three , or the two , or one of the four . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Tell me precisely of what complexion .
MOTH : Of the sea-water green , sir . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Is that one of the four complexions ?
MOTH : As I have read , sir ; and the best of them too . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Green indeed is the colour of lovers ; but to have a love of that colour , methinks Samson had small reason for it . He surely affected her for her wit .
MOTH : It was so , sir ; for she had a green wit . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : My love is most immaculate white and red .
MOTH : Most maculate thoughts , master , are masked under such colours . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Define , define , well-educated infant .
MOTH : My father 's wit and my mother 's tongue , assist me ! DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Sweet invocation of a child ; most pretty and pathetical !
