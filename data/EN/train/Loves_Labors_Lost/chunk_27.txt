KATHARINE : Then die a calf , before your horns do grow .
LONGAVILLE : One word in private with you , ere I die .
KATHARINE : Bleat softly then ; the butcher hears you cry . They converse apart
BOYET : The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen As is the razor 's edge invisible , Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen , Above the sense of sense ; so sensible Seemeth their conference ; their conceits have wings Fleeter than arrows , bullets , wind , thought , swifter things .
ROSALINE : Not one word more , my maids ; break off , break off .
BIRON : By heaven , all dry-beaten with pure scoff !
FERDINAND : Farewell , mad wenches ; you have simple wits .
PRINCESS : Twenty adieus , my frozen Muscovits . Are these the breed of wits so wonder 'd at ?
BOYET : Tapers they are , with your sweet breaths puff 'd out .
ROSALINE : Well-liking wits they have ; gross , gross ; fat , fat .
PRINCESS : O poverty in wit , kingly-poor flout ! Will they not , think you , hang themselves tonight ? Or ever , but in vizards , show their faces ? This pert Biron was out of countenance quite .
ROSALINE : O , they were all in lamentable cases ! The king was weeping-ripe for a good word .
PRINCESS : Biron did swear himself out of all suit .
MARIA : Dumain was at my service , and his sword : No point , quoth I ; my servant straight was mute .
KATHARINE : Lord Longaville said , I came o 'er his heart ; And trow you what he called me ?
PRINCESS : Qualm , perhaps .
KATHARINE : Yes , in good faith .
PRINCESS : Go , sickness as thou art !
ROSALINE : Well , better wits have worn plain statute-caps . But will you hear ? the king is my love sworn .
PRINCESS : And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me .
KATHARINE : And Longaville was for my service born .
MARIA : Dumain is mine , as sure as bark on tree .
BOYET : Madam , and pretty mistresses , give ear : Immediately they will again be here In their own shapes ; for it can never be They will digest this harsh indignity .
PRINCESS : Will they return ?
BOYET : They will , they will , God knows , And leap for joy , though they are lame with blows : Therefore change favours ; and , when they repair , Blow like sweet roses in this summer air .
PRINCESS : How blow ? how blow ? speak to be understood .
BOYET : Fair ladies mask 'd are roses in their bud ; Dismask 'd , their damask sweet commixture shown , Are angels vailing clouds , or roses blown .
PRINCESS : Avaunt , perplexity ! What shall we do , If they return in their own shapes to woo ?
ROSALINE : Good madam , if by me you 'll be advised , Let 's , mock them still , as well known as disguised : Let us complain to them what fools were here , Disguised like Muscovites , in shapeless gear ; And wonder what they were and to what end Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn 'd And their rough carriage so ridiculous , Should be presented at our tent to us .
BOYET : Ladies , withdraw : the gallants are at hand .
PRINCESS : Whip to our tents , as roes run o 'er land . Re-enter FERDINAND , BIRON , LONGAVILLE , and DUMAIN , in their proper habits
FERDINAND : Fair sir , God save you ! Where 's the princess ?
BOYET : Gone to her tent . Please it your majesty Command me any service to her thither ?
FERDINAND : That she vouchsafe me audience for one word .
BOYET : I will ; and so will she , I know , my lord . Exit
