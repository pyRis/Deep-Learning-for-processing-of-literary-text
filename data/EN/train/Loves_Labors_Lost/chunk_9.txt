PRINCESS : Come to our pavilion : Boyet is disposed .
BOYET : But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed . I only have made a mouth of his eye , By adding a tongue which I know will not lie .
ROSALINE : Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully .
MARIA : He is Cupid 's grandfather and learns news of him .
ROSALINE : Then was Venus like her mother , for her father is but grim .
BOYET : Do you hear , my mad wenches ?
MARIA : No .
BOYET : What then , do you see ?
ROSALINE : Ay , our way to be gone .
BOYET : You are too hard for me . LOVE 'S LABOURS LOST Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Warble , child ; make passionate my sense of hearing .
MOTH : Concolinel . Singing DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Sweet air ! Go , tenderness of years ; take this key , give enlargement to the swain , bring him festinately hither : I must employ him in a letter to my love .
MOTH : Master , will you win your love with a French brawl ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : How meanest thou ? brawling in French ?
MOTH : No , my complete master : but to jig off a tune at the tongue 's end , canary to it with your feet , humour it with turning up your eyelids , sigh a note and sing a note , sometime through the throat , as if you swallowed love with singing love , sometime through the nose , as if you snuffed up love by smelling love ; with your hat penthouse-like o 'er the shop of your eyes ; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit ; or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting ; and keep not too long in one tune , but a snip and away . These are complements , these are humours ; these betray nice wenches , that would be betrayed without these ; and make them men of note--do you note me ? --that most are affected to these . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : How hast thou purchased this experience ?
MOTH : By my penny of observation . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : But O , --but O , --
MOTH : ' The hobby-horse is forgot . ' DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Callest thou my love ' hobby-horse ' ?
MOTH : No , master ; the hobby-horse is but a colt , and your love perhaps a hackney . But have you forgot your love ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Almost I had .
MOTH : Negligent student ! learn her by heart . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : By heart and in heart , boy .
MOTH : And out of heart , master : all those three I will prove . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : What wilt thou prove ?
MOTH : A man , if I live ; and this , by , in , and without , upon the instant : by heart you love her , because your heart cannot come by her ; in heart you love her , because your heart is in love with her ; and out of heart you love her , being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I am all these three .
MOTH : And three times as much more , and yet nothing at all . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Fetch hither the swain : he must carry me a letter .
MOTH : A message well sympathized ; a horse to be ambassador for an ass . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Ha , ha ! what sayest thou ?
MOTH : Marry , sir , you must send the ass upon the horse , for he is very slow-gaited . But I go . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : The way is but short : away !
MOTH : As swift as lead , sir . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : The meaning , pretty ingenious ? Is not lead a metal heavy , dull , and slow ?
MOTH : Minime , honest master ; or rather , master , no . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I say lead is slow .
