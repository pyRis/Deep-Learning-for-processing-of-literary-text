HOLOFERNES : Shall I have audience ? he shall present Hercules in minority : his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake ; and I will have an apology for that purpose .
MOTH : An excellent device ! so , if any of the audience hiss , you may cry ' Well done , Hercules ! now thou crushest the snake ! ' that is the way to make an offence gracious , though few have the grace to do it . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : For the rest of the Worthies ? --
HOLOFERNES : I will play three myself .
MOTH : Thrice-worthy gentleman ! DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Shall I tell you a thing ?
HOLOFERNES : We attend . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : We will have , if this fadge not , an antique . I beseech you , follow .
HOLOFERNES : Via , goodman Dull ! thou hast spoken no word all this while .
DULL : Nor understood none neither , sir .
HOLOFERNES : Allons ! we will employ thee .
DULL : I 'll make one in a dance , or so ; or I will play On the tabour to the Worthies , and let them dance the hay .
HOLOFERNES : Most dull , honest Dull ! To our sport , away ! LOVE 'S LABOURS LOST Enter the PRINCESS , KATHARINE , ROSALINE , and MARIA
PRINCESS : Sweet hearts , we shall be rich ere we depart , If fairings come thus plentifully in : A lady wall 'd about with diamonds ! Look you what I have from the loving king .
ROSALINE : Madame , came nothing else along with that ?
PRINCESS : Nothing but this ! yes , as much love in rhyme As would be cramm 'd up in a sheet of paper , Writ o ' both sides the leaf , margent and all , That he was fain to seal on Cupid 's name .
ROSALINE : That was the way to make his godhead wax , For he hath been five thousand years a boy .
KATHARINE : Ay , and a shrewd unhappy gallows too .
ROSALINE : You 'll ne 'er be friends with him ; a ' kill 'd your sister .
KATHARINE : He made her melancholy , sad , and heavy ; And so she died : had she been light , like you , Of such a merry , nimble , stirring spirit , She might ha ' been a grandam ere she died : And so may you ; for a light heart lives long .
ROSALINE : What 's your dark meaning , mouse , of this light word ?
KATHARINE : A light condition in a beauty dark .
ROSALINE : We need more light to find your meaning out .
KATHARINE : You 'll mar the light by taking it in snuff ; Therefore I 'll darkly end the argument .
ROSALINE : Look what you do , you do it still i ' the dark .
KATHARINE : So do not you , for you are a light wench .
ROSALINE : Indeed I weigh not you , and therefore light .
KATHARINE : You weigh me not ? O , that 's you care not for me .
ROSALINE : Great reason ; for ' past cure is still past care . ' 
PRINCESS : Well bandied both ; a set of wit well play 'd . But Rosaline , you have a favour too : Who sent it ? and what is it ?
ROSALINE : I would you knew : An if my face were but as fair as yours , My favour were as great ; be witness this . Nay , I have verses too , I thank Biron : The numbers true ; and , were the numbering too , I were the fairest goddess on the ground : I am compared to twenty thousand fairs . O , he hath drawn my picture in his letter !
PRINCESS : Any thing like ?
ROSALINE : Much in the letters ; nothing in the praise .
PRINCESS : Beauteous as ink ; a good conclusion .
KATHARINE : Fair as a text B in a copy-book .
ROSALINE : ' Ware pencils , ho ! let me not die your debtor , My red dominical , my golden letter : O , that your face were not so full of O 's !
