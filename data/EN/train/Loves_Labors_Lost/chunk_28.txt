FERDINAND : A blister on his sweet tongue , with my heart , That put Armado 's page out of his part !
BIRON : See where it comes ! Behavior , what wert thou Till this madman show 'd thee ? and what art thou now ? Re-enter the PRINCESS , ushered by BOYET , ROSALINE , MARIA , and KATHARINE
FERDINAND : All hail , sweet madam , and fair time of day !
PRINCESS : ' Fair ' in ' all hail ' is foul , as I conceive .
FERDINAND : Construe my speeches better , if you may .
PRINCESS : Then wish me better ; I will give you leave .
FERDINAND : We came to visit you , and purpose now To lead you to our court ; vouchsafe it then .
PRINCESS : This field shall hold me ; and so hold your vow : Nor God , nor I , delights in perjured men .
FERDINAND : Rebuke me not for that which you provoke : The virtue of your eye must break my oath .
PRINCESS : You nickname virtue ; vice you should have spoke ; For virtue 's office never breaks men 's troth . Now by my maiden honour , yet as pure As the unsullied lily , I protest , A world of torments though I should endure , I would not yield to be your house 's guest ; So much I hate a breaking cause to be Of heavenly oaths , vow 'd with integrity .
FERDINAND : O , you have lived in desolation here , Unseen , unvisited , much to our shame .
PRINCESS : Not so , my lord ; it is not so , I swear ; We have had pastimes here and pleasant game : A mess of Russians left us but of late .
FERDINAND : How , madam ! Russians !
PRINCESS : Ay , in truth , my lord ; Trim gallants , full of courtship and of state .
ROSALINE : Madam , speak true . It is not so , my lord : My lady , to the manner of the days , In courtesy gives undeserving praise . We four indeed confronted were with four In Russian habit : here they stay 'd an hour , And talk 'd apace ; and in that hour , my lord , They did not bless us with one happy word . I dare not call them fools ; but this I think , When they are thirsty , fools would fain have drink .
BIRON : This jest is dry to me . Fair gentle sweet , Your wit makes wise things foolish : when we greet , With eyes best seeing , heaven 's fiery eye , By light we lose light : your capacity Is of that nature that to your huge store Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor .
ROSALINE : This proves you wise and rich , for in my eye , --
BIRON : I am a fool , and full of poverty .
ROSALINE : But that you take what doth to you belong , It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue .
BIRON : O , I am yours , and all that I possess !
ROSALINE : All the fool mine ?
BIRON : I cannot give you less .
ROSALINE : Which of the vizards was it that you wore ?
BIRON : Where ? when ? what vizard ? why demand you this ?
ROSALINE : There , then , that vizard ; that superfluous case That hid the worse and show 'd the better face .
FERDINAND : We are descried ; they 'll mock us now downright .
DUMAIN : Let us confess and turn it to a jest .
PRINCESS : Amazed , my lord ? why looks your highness sad ?
ROSALINE : Help , hold his brows ! he 'll swoon ! Why look you pale ? Sea-sick , I think , coming from Muscovy .
BIRON : Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury . Can any face of brass hold longer out ?
