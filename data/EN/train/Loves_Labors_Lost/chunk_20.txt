DUMAIN : Dark needs no candles now , for dark is light .
BIRON : Your mistresses dare never come in rain , For fear their colours should be wash 'd away .
FERDINAND : ' Twere good , yours did ; for , sir , to tell you plain , I 'll find a fairer face not wash 'd to-day .
BIRON : I 'll prove her fair , or talk till doomsday here .
FERDINAND : No devil will fright thee then so much as she .
DUMAIN : I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear .
LONGAVILLE : Look , here 's thy love : my foot and her face see .
BIRON : O , if the streets were paved with thine eyes , Her feet were much too dainty for such tread !
DUMAIN : O , vile ! then , as she goes , what upward lies The street should see as she walk 'd overhead .
FERDINAND : But what of this ? are we not all in love ?
BIRON : Nothing so sure ; and thereby all forsworn .
FERDINAND : Then leave this chat ; and , good Biron , now prove Our loving lawful , and our faith not torn .
DUMAIN : Ay , marry , there ; some flattery for this evil .
LONGAVILLE : O , some authority how to proceed ; Some tricks , some quillets , how to cheat the devil .
DUMAIN : Some salve for perjury .
