PRINCESS : What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter ? What vane ? what weathercock ? did you ever hear better ?
BOYET : I am much deceived but I remember the style .
PRINCESS : Else your memory is bad , going o 'er it erewhile .
BOYET : This Armado is a Spaniard , that keeps here in court ; A phantasime , a Monarcho , and one that makes sport To the prince and his bookmates .
PRINCESS : Thou fellow , a word : Who gave thee this letter ?
COSTARD : I told you ; my lord .
PRINCESS : To whom shouldst thou give it ?
COSTARD : From my lord to my lady .
PRINCESS : From which lord to which lady ?
COSTARD : From my lord Biron , a good master of mine , To a lady of France that he call 'd Rosaline .
PRINCESS : Thou hast mistaken his letter . Come , lords , away . To ROSALINE Here , sweet , put up this : ' twill be thine another day .
BOYET : Who is the suitor ? who is the suitor ?
ROSALINE : Shall I teach you to know ?
BOYET : Ay , my continent of beauty .
ROSALINE : Why , she that bears the bow . Finely put off !
BOYET : My lady goes to kill horns ; but , if thou marry , Hang me by the neck , if horns that year miscarry . Finely put on !
ROSALINE : Well , then , I am the shooter .
BOYET : And who is your deer ?
ROSALINE : If we choose by the horns , yourself come not near . Finely put on , indeed !
MARIA : You still wrangle with her , Boyet , and she strikes at the brow .
BOYET : But she herself is hit lower : have I hit her now ?
ROSALINE : Shall I come upon thee with an old saying , that was a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy , as touching the hit it ?
BOYET : So I may answer thee with one as old , that was a woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little wench , as touching the hit it .
ROSALINE : Thou canst not hit it , hit it , hit it , Thou canst not hit it , my good man .
BOYET : An I cannot , cannot , cannot , An I cannot , another can .
COSTARD : By my troth , most pleasant : how both did fit it !
MARIA : A mark marvellous well shot , for they both did hit it .
BOYET : A mark ! O , mark but that mark ! A mark , says my lady ! Let the mark have a prick in 't , to mete at , if it may be .
MARIA : Wide o ' the bow hand ! i ' faith , your hand is out .
COSTARD : Indeed , a ' must shoot nearer , or he 'll ne 'er hit the clout .
BOYET : An if my hand be out , then belike your hand is in .
COSTARD : Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin .
MARIA : Come , come , you talk greasily ; your lips grow foul .
COSTARD : She 's too hard for you at pricks , sir : challenge her to bowl .
BOYET : I fear too much rubbing . Good night , my good owl .
