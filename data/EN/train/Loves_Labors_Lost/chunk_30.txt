COSTARD : O Lord , sir , they would know Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no .
BIRON : What , are there but three ?
COSTARD : No , sir ; but it is vara fine , For every one pursents three .
BIRON : And three times thrice is nine .
COSTARD : Not so , sir ; under correction , sir ; I hope it is not so . You cannot beg us , sir , I can assure you , sir we know what we know : I hope , sir , three times thrice , sir , --
BIRON : Is not nine .
COSTARD : Under correction , sir , we know whereuntil it doth amount .
BIRON : By Jove , I always took three threes for nine .
COSTARD : O Lord , sir , it were pity you should get your living by reckoning , sir .
BIRON : How much is it ?
COSTARD : O Lord , sir , the parties themselves , the actors , sir , will show whereuntil it doth amount : for mine own part , I am , as they say , but to parfect one man in one poor man , Pompion the Great , sir .
BIRON : Art thou one of the Worthies ?
COSTARD : It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the Great : for mine own part , I know not the degree of the Worthy , but I am to stand for him .
BIRON : Go , bid them prepare .
COSTARD : We will turn it finely off , sir ; we will take some care . Exit
FERDINAND : Biron , they will shame us : let them not approach .
BIRON : We are shame-proof , my lord : and tis some policy To have one show worse than the king 's and his company .
FERDINAND : I say they shall not come .
PRINCESS : Nay , my good lord , let me o 'errule you now : That sport best pleases that doth least know how : Where zeal strives to content , and the contents Dies in the zeal of that which it presents : Their form confounded makes most form in mirth , When great things labouring perish in their birth .
BIRON : A right description of our sport , my lord . Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Anointed , I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will utter a brace of words . Converses apart with FERDINAND , and delivers him a paper
PRINCESS : Doth this man serve God ?
BIRON : Why ask you ?
PRINCESS : He speaks not like a man of God 's making . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : That is all one , my fair , sweet , honey monarch ; for , I protest , the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical ; too , too vain , too too vain : but we will put it , as they say , to fortuna de la guerra . I wish you the peace of mind , most royal couplement ! Exit
FERDINAND : Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies . He presents Hector of Troy ; the swain , Pompey the Great ; the parish curate , Alexander ; Armado 's page , Hercules ; the pedant , Judas Maccabaeus : And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive , These four will change habits , and present the other five .
BIRON : There is five in the first show .
FERDINAND : You are deceived ; ' tis not so .
BIRON : The pedant , the braggart , the hedge-priest , the fool and the boy : -- Abate throw at novum , and the whole world again Cannot pick out five such , take each one in his vein .
FERDINAND : The ship is under sail , and here she comes amain . Enter COSTARD , for Pompey
COSTARD : I Pompey am , --
BOYET : You lie , you are not he .
COSTARD : I Pompey am , --
BOYET : With libbard 's head on knee .
BIRON : Well said , old mocker : I must needs be friends with thee .
COSTARD : I Pompey am , Pompey surnamed the Big--
DUMAIN : The Great .
