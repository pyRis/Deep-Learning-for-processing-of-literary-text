BOYET : If to come hither you have measured miles , And many miles , the princess bids you tell How many inches doth fill up one mile .
BIRON : Tell her , we measure them by weary steps .
BOYET : She hears herself .
ROSALINE : How many weary steps , Of many weary miles you have o 'ergone , Are number 'd in the travel of one mile ?
BIRON : We number nothing that we spend for you : Our duty is so rich , so infinite , That we may do it still without accompt . Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face , That we , like savages , may worship it .
ROSALINE : My face is but a moon , and clouded too .
FERDINAND : Blessed are clouds , to do as such clouds do ! Vouchsafe , bright moon , and these thy stars , to shine , Those clouds removed , upon our watery eyne .
ROSALINE : O vain petitioner ! beg a greater matter ; Thou now request 'st but moonshine in the water .
FERDINAND : Then , in our measure do but vouchsafe one change . Thou bid 'st me beg : this begging is not strange .
ROSALINE : Play , music , then ! Nay , you must do it soon . Music plays Not yet ! no dance ! Thus change I like the moon .
FERDINAND : Will you not dance ? How come you thus estranged ?
ROSALINE : You took the moon at full , but now she 's changed .
FERDINAND : Yet still she is the moon , and I the man . The music plays ; vouchsafe some motion to it .
ROSALINE : Our ears vouchsafe it .
FERDINAND : But your legs should do it .
ROSALINE : Since you are strangers and come here by chance , We 'll not be nice : take hands . We will not dance .
FERDINAND : Why take we hands , then ?
ROSALINE : Only to part friends : Curtsy , sweet hearts ; and so the measure ends .
FERDINAND : More measure of this measure ; be not nice .
ROSALINE : We can afford no more at such a price .
FERDINAND : Prize you yourselves : what buys your company ?
ROSALINE : Your absence only .
FERDINAND : That can never be .
ROSALINE : Then cannot we be bought : and so , adieu ; Twice to your visor , and half once to you .
FERDINAND : If you deny to dance , let 's hold more chat .
ROSALINE : In private , then .
FERDINAND : I am best pleased with that . They converse apart
BIRON : White-handed mistress , one sweet word with thee .
PRINCESS : Honey , and milk , and sugar ; there is three .
BIRON : Nay then , two treys , and if you grow so nice , Metheglin , wort , and malmsey : well run , dice ! There 's half-a-dozen sweets .
PRINCESS : Seventh sweet , adieu : Since you can cog , I 'll play no more with you .
BIRON : One word in secret .
PRINCESS : Let it not be sweet .
BIRON : Thou grievest my gall .
PRINCESS : Gall ! bitter .
BIRON : Therefore meet . They converse apart
DUMAIN : Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word ?
MARIA : Name it .
DUMAIN : Fair lady , --
MARIA : Say you so ? Fair lord , -- Take that for your fair lady .
DUMAIN : Please it you , As much in private , and I 'll bid adieu . They converse apart
KATHARINE : What , was your vizard made without a tongue ?
LONGAVILLE : I know the reason , lady , why you ask .
KATHARINE : O for your reason ! quickly , sir ; I long .
LONGAVILLE : You have a double tongue within your mask , And would afford my speechless vizard half .
KATHARINE : Veal , quoth the Dutchman . Is not ' veal ' a calf ?
LONGAVILLE : A calf , fair lady !
KATHARINE : No , a fair lord calf .
LONGAVILLE : Let 's part the word .
KATHARINE : No , I 'll not be your half Take all , and wean it ; it may prove an ox .
