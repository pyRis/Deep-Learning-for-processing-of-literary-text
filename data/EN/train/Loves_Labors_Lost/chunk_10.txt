ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Sweet smoke of rhetoric ! He reputes me a cannon ; and the bullet , that 's he : I shoot thee at the swain .
MOTH : Thump then and I flee . Exit DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : A most acute juvenal ; voluble and free of grace ! By thy favour , sweet welkin , I must sigh in thy face : Most rude melancholy , valour gives thee place . My herald is return 'd . Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD
MOTH : A wonder , master ! here 's a costard broken in a shin . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Some enigma , some riddle : come , thy l 'envoy ; begin .
COSTARD : No enigma , no riddle , no l 'envoy ; no salve in the mail , sir : O , sir , plantain , a plain plantain ! no l 'envoy , no l 'envoy ; no salve , sir , but a plantain ! DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : By virtue , thou enforcest laughter ; thy silly thought my spleen ; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling . O , pardon me , my stars ! Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l 'envoy , and the word l 'envoy for a salve ?
MOTH : Do the wise think them other ? is not l 'envoy a salve ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : No , page : it is an epilogue or discourse , to make plain Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain . I will example it : The fox , the ape , and the humble-bee , Were still at odds , being but three . There 's the moral . Now the l 'envoy .
MOTH : I will add the l 'envoy . Say the moral again . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : The fox , the ape , and the humble-bee , Were still at odds , being but three .
MOTH : Until the goose came out of door , And stay 'd the odds by adding four . Now will I begin your moral , and do you follow with my l 'envoy . The fox , the ape , and the humble-bee , Were still at odds , being but three . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Until the goose came out of door , Staying the odds by adding four .
MOTH : A good l 'envoy , ending in the goose : would you desire more ?
COSTARD : The boy hath sold him a bargain , a goose , that 's flat . Sir , your pennyworth is good , an your goose be fat . To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose : Let me see ; a fat l 'envoy ; ay , that 's a fat goose . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Come hither , come hither . How did this argument begin ?
MOTH : By saying that a costard was broken in a shin . Then call 'd you for the l 'envoy .
COSTARD : True , and I for a plantain : thus came your argument in ; Then the boy 's fat l 'envoy , the goose that you bought ; And he ended the market . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : But tell me ; how was there a costard broken in a shin ?
MOTH : I will tell you sensibly .
COSTARD : Thou hast no feeling of it , Moth : I will speak that l 'envoy : I Costard , running out , that was safely within , Fell over the threshold and broke my shin . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : We will talk no more of this matter .
COSTARD : Till there be more matter in the shin . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Sirrah Costard , I will enfranchise thee .
COSTARD : O , marry me to one Frances : I smell some l 'envoy , some goose , in this . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : By my sweet soul , I mean setting thee at liberty , enfreedoming thy person ; thou wert immured , restrained , captivated , bound .
COSTARD : True , true ; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose . DON
