FERDINAND : Saint Cupid , then ! and , soldiers , to the field !
BIRON : Advance your standards , and upon them , lords ; Pell-mell , down with them ! but be first advised , In conflict that you get the sun of them .
LONGAVILLE : Now to plain-dealing ; lay these glozes by : Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France ?
FERDINAND : And win them too : therefore let us devise Some entertainment for them in their tents .
BIRON : First , from the park let us conduct them thither ; Then homeward every man attach the hand Of his fair mistress : in the afternoon We will with some strange pastime solace them , Such as the shortness of the time can shape ; For revels , dances , masks and merry hours Forerun fair Love , strewing her way with flowers .
FERDINAND : Away , away ! no time shall be omitted That will betime , and may by us be fitted .
BIRON : Allons ! allons ! Sow 'd cockle reap 'd no corn ; And justice always whirls in equal measure : Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn ; If so , our copper buys no better treasure . LOVE 'S LABOURS LOST Enter HOLOFERNES , SIR NATHANIEL , and DULL
HOLOFERNES : Satis quod sufficit .
SIR NATHANIEL : I praise God for you , sir : your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious ; pleasant without scurrility , witty without affection , audacious without impudency , learned without opinion , and strange with- out heresy . I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the king 's , who is intituled , nomi- nated , or called , Don Adriano de Armado .
HOLOFERNES : Novi hominem tanquam te : his humour is lofty , his discourse peremptory , his tongue filed , his eye ambitious , his gait majestical , and his general behavior vain , ridiculous , and thrasonical . He is too picked , too spruce , too affected , too odd , as it were , too peregrinate , as I may call it .
SIR NATHANIEL : A most singular and choice epithet . Draws out his table-book
HOLOFERNES : He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument . I abhor such fanatical phantasimes , such insociable and point-devise companions ; such rackers of orthography , as to speak dout , fine , when he should say doubt ; det , when he should pronounce debt , --d , e , b , t , not d , e , t : he clepeth a calf , cauf ; half , hauf ; neighbour vocatur nebor ; neigh abbreviated ne . This is abhominable , --which he would call abbominable : it insinuateth me of insanie : anne intelligis , domine ? to make frantic , lunatic .
SIR NATHANIEL : Laus Deo , bene intelligo .
HOLOFERNES : Bon , bon , fort bon , Priscian ! a little scratch 'd , ' twill serve .
SIR NATHANIEL : Videsne quis venit ?
HOLOFERNES : Video , et gaudeo . Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO , MOTH , and COSTARD DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Chirrah ! To MOTH
HOLOFERNES : Quare chirrah , not sirrah ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Men of peace , well encountered .
HOLOFERNES : Most military sir , salutation .
MOTH : They have been at a great feast of languages , and stolen the scraps .
COSTARD : O , they have lived long on the alms-basket of words . I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word ; for thou art not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus : thou art easier swallowed than a flap-dragon .
MOTH : Peace ! the peal begins . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Monsieur , are you not lettered ?
MOTH : Yes , yes ; he teaches boys the hornbook . What is a , b , spelt backward , with the horn on his head ?
HOLOFERNES : Ba , pueritia , with a horn added .
MOTH : Ba , most silly sheep with a horn . You hear his learning .
HOLOFERNES : Quis , quis , thou consonant ?
MOTH : The third of the five vowels , if you repeat them ; or the fifth , if I.
