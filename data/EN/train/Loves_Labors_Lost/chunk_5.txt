ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Is there not a ballad , boy , of the King and the Beggar ?
MOTH : The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since : but I think now ' tis not to be found ; or , if it were , it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I will have that subject newly writ o 'er , that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent . Boy , I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard : she deserves well .
MOTH : To be whipped ; and yet a better love than my master . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Sing , boy ; my spirit grows heavy in love .
MOTH : And that 's great marvel , loving a light wench . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I say , sing .
MOTH : Forbear till this company be past . Enter DULL , COSTARD , and JAQUENETTA
DULL : Sir , the duke 's pleasure is , that you keep Costard safe : and you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance ; but a ' must fast three days a week . For this damsel , I must keep her at the park : she is allowed for the day-woman . Fare you well . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I do betray myself with blushing . Maid !
JAQUENETTA : Man ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I will visit thee at the lodge .
JAQUENETTA : That 's hereby . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I know where it is situate .
JAQUENETTA : Lord , how wise you are ! DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I will tell thee wonders .
JAQUENETTA : With that face ? DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : I love thee .
JAQUENETTA : So I heard you say . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : And so , farewell .
JAQUENETTA : Fair weather after you !
DULL : Come , Jaquenetta , away ! DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Villain , thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned .
COSTARD : Well , sir , I hope , when I do it , I shall do it on a full stomach . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Thou shalt be heavily punished .
COSTARD : I am more bound to you than your fellows , for they are but lightly rewarded . DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO : Take away this villain ; shut him up .
MOTH : Come , you transgressing slave ; away !
COSTARD : Let me not be pent up , sir : I will fast , being loose .
MOTH : No , sir ; that were fast and loose : thou shalt to prison .
COSTARD : Well , if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen , some shall see .
MOTH : What shall some see ?
COSTARD : Nay , nothing , Master Moth , but what they look upon . It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words ; and therefore I will say nothing : I thank God I have as little patience as another man ; and therefore I can be quiet . DON
