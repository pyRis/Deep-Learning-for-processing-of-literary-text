LEWIS : Lady , with me , with me thy fortune lies .
BLANCH : There where my fortune lives , there my life dies .
KING JOHN : Cousin , go draw our puissance together . Exit BASTARD France , I am burn 'd up with inflaming wrath ; A rage whose heat hath this condition , That nothing can allay , nothing but blood , The blood , and dearest-valued blood , of France .
KING PHILIP : Thy rage sham burn thee up , and thou shalt turn To ashes , ere our blood shall quench that fire : Look to thyself , thou art in jeopardy .
KING JOHN : No more than he that threats . To arms let 's hie ! Alarums , excursions . Enter the BASTARD , with AUSTRIA 'S head
BASTARD : Now , by my life , this day grows wondrous hot ; Some airy devil hovers in the sky And pours down mischief . Austria 's head lie there , While Philip breathes . Enter KING JOHN , ARTHUR , and HUBERT
KING JOHN : Hubert , keep this boy . Philip , make up : My mother is assailed in our tent , And ta 'en , I fear .
BASTARD : My lord , I rescued her ; Her highness is in safety , fear you not : But on , my liege ; for very little pains Will bring this labour to an happy end . Alarums , excursions , retreat . Enter KING JOHN , QUEEN ELINOR , ARTHUR , the BASTARD , HUBERT , and Lords
KING JOHN : So shall it be ; your grace shall stay behind So strongly guarded . To ARTHUR Cousin , look not sad : Thy grandam loves thee ; and thy uncle will As dear be to thee as thy father was .
ARTHUR : O , this will make my mother die with grief !
KING JOHN : Cousin , away for England ! haste before : And , ere our coming , see thou shake the bags Of hoarding abbots ; imprisoned angels Set at liberty : the fat ribs of peace Must by the hungry now be fed upon : Use our commission in his utmost force .
BASTARD : Bell , book , and candle shall not drive me back , When gold and silver becks me to come on . I leave your highness . Grandam , I will pray , If ever I remember to be holy , For your fair safety ; so , I kiss your hand .
ELINOR : Farewell , gentle cousin .
KING JOHN : Coz , farewell . Exit the BASTARD
QUEEN ELINOR : Come hither , little kinsman ; hark , a word .
KING JOHN : Come hither , Hubert . O my gentle Hubert , We owe thee much ! within this wall of flesh There is a soul counts thee her creditor And with advantage means to pay thy love : And my good friend , thy voluntary oath Lives in this bosom , dearly cherished . Give me thy hand . I had a thing to say , But I will fit it with some better time . By heaven , Hubert , I am almost ashamed To say what good respect I have of thee .
HUBERT : I am much bounden to your majesty .
