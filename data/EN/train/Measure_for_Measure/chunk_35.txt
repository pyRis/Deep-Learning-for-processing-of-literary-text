Provost : This is another prisoner that I saved . Who should have died when Claudio lost his head ; As like almost to Claudio as himself . Unmuffles CLAUDIO
DUKE VINCENTIO : If he be like your brother , for his sake Is he pardon 'd ; and , for your lovely sake , Give me your hand and say you will be mine . He is my brother too : but fitter time for that . By this Lord Angelo perceives he 's safe ; Methinks I see a quickening in his eye . Well , Angelo , your evil quits you well : Look that you love your wife ; her worth worth yours . I find an apt remission in myself ; And yet here 's one in place I cannot pardon . To LUCIO You , sirrah , that knew me for a fool , a coward , One all of luxury , an ass , a madman ; Wherein have I so deserved of you , That you extol me thus ?
LUCIO : ' Faith , my lord . I spoke it but according to the trick . If you will hang me for it , you may ; but I had rather it would please you I might be whipt .
DUKE VINCENTIO : Whipt first , sir , and hanged after . Proclaim it , provost , round about the city . Is any woman wrong 'd by this lewd fellow , As I have heard him swear himself there 's one Whom he begot with child , let her appear , And he shall marry her : the nuptial finish 'd , Let him be whipt and hang 'd .
LUCIO : I beseech your highness , do not marry me to a whore . Your highness said even now , I made you a duke : good my lord , do not recompense me in making me a cuckold .
DUKE VINCENTIO : Upon mine honour , thou shalt marry her . Thy slanders I forgive ; and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits . Take him to prison ; And see our pleasure herein executed .
LUCIO : Marrying a punk , my lord , is pressing to death , whipping , and hanging .
