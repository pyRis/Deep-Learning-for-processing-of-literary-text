DUKE VINCENTIO : Relate your wrongs ; in what ? by whom ? be brief . Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice : Reveal yourself to him .
ISABELLA : O worthy duke , You bid me seek redemption of the devil : Hear me yourself ; for that which I must speak Must either punish me , not being believed , Or wring redress from you . Hear me , O hear me , here !
ANGELO : My lord , her wits , I fear me , are not firm : She hath been a suitor to me for her brother Cut off by course of justice , --
ISABELLA : By course of justice !
ANGELO : And she will speak most bitterly and strange .
ISABELLA : Most strange , but yet most truly , will I speak : That Angelo 's forsworn ; is it not strange ? That Angelo 's a murderer ; is ' t not strange ? That Angelo is an adulterous thief , An hypocrite , a virgin-violator ; Is it not strange and strange ?
DUKE VINCENTIO : Nay , it is ten times strange .
ISABELLA : It is not truer he is Angelo Than this is all as true as it is strange : Nay , it is ten times true ; for truth is truth To the end of reckoning .
DUKE VINCENTIO : Away with her ! Poor soul , She speaks this in the infirmity of sense .
ISABELLA : O prince , I conjure thee , as thou believest There is another comfort than this world , That thou neglect me not , with that opinion That I am touch 'd with madness ! Make not impossible That which but seems unlike : ' tis not impossible But one , the wicked 'st caitiff on the ground , May seem as shy , as grave , as just , as absolute As Angelo ; even so may Angelo , In all his dressings , characts , titles , forms , Be an arch-villain ; believe it , royal prince : If he be less , he 's nothing ; but he 's more , Had I more name for badness .
DUKE VINCENTIO : By mine honesty , If she be mad , --as I believe no other , -- Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense , Such a dependency of thing on thing , As e 'er I heard in madness .
ISABELLA : O gracious duke , Harp not on that , nor do not banish reason For inequality ; but let your reason serve To make the truth appear where it seems hid , And hide the false seems true .
DUKE VINCENTIO : Many that are not mad Have , sure , more lack of reason . What would you say ?
ISABELLA : I am the sister of one Claudio , Condemn 'd upon the act of fornication To lose his head ; condemn 'd by Angelo : I , in probation of a sisterhood , Was sent to by my brother ; one Lucio As then the messenger , --
LUCIO : That 's I , an 't like your grace : I came to her from Claudio , and desired her To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo For her poor brother 's pardon .
ISABELLA : That 's he indeed .
DUKE VINCENTIO : You were not bid to speak .
LUCIO : No , my good lord ; Nor wish 'd to hold my peace .
DUKE VINCENTIO : I wish you now , then ; Pray you , take note of it : and when you have A business for yourself , pray heaven you then Be perfect .
LUCIO : I warrant your honour .
DUKE VINCENTIO : The warrants for yourself ; take heed to 't .
ISABELLA : This gentleman told somewhat of my tale , --
LUCIO : Right .
DUKE VINCENTIO : It may be right ; but you are i ' the wrong To speak before your time . Proceed .
ISABELLA : I went To this pernicious caitiff deputy , --
DUKE VINCENTIO : That 's somewhat madly spoken .
ISABELLA : Pardon it ; The phrase is to the matter .
DUKE VINCENTIO : Mended again . The matter ; proceed .
