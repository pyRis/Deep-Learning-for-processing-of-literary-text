First Gentleman : But , most of all , agreeing with the proclamation .
LUCIO : Away ! let 's go learn the truth of it .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : Thus , what with the war , what with the sweat , what with the gallows and what with poverty , I am custom-shrunk . Enter POMPEY How now ! what 's the news with you ?
POMPEY : Yonder man is carried to prison .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : Well ; what has he done ?
POMPEY : A woman .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : But what 's his offence ?
POMPEY : Groping for trouts in a peculiar river .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : What , is there a maid with child by him ?
POMPEY : No , but there 's a woman with maid by him . You have not heard of the proclamation , have you ?
MISTRESS OVERDONE : What proclamation , man ?
POMPEY : All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : And what shall become of those in the city ?
POMPEY : They shall stand for seed : they had gone down too , but that a wise burgher put in for them .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down ?
POMPEY : To the ground , mistress .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : Why , here 's a change indeed in the commonwealth ! What shall become of me ?
POMPEY : Come ; fear you not : good counsellors lack no clients : though you change your place , you need not change your trade ; I 'll be your tapster still . Courage ! there will be pity taken on you : you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service , you will be considered .
MISTRESS OVERDONE : What 's to do here , Thomas tapster ? let 's withdraw .
POMPEY : Here comes Signior Claudio , led by the provost to prison ; and there 's Madam Juliet . Enter Provost , CLAUDIO , JULIET , and Officers
CLAUDIO : Fellow , why dost thou show me thus to the world ? Bear me to prison , where I am committed .
Provost : I do it not in evil disposition , But from Lord Angelo by special charge .
CLAUDIO : Thus can the demigod Authority Make us pay down for our offence by weight The words of heaven ; on whom it will , it will ; On whom it will not , so ; yet still ' tis just . Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
LUCIO : Why , how now , Claudio ! whence comes this restraint ?
CLAUDIO : From too much liberty , my Lucio , liberty : As surfeit is the father of much fast , So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint . Our natures do pursue , Like rats that ravin down their proper bane , A thirsty evil ; and when we drink we die .
LUCIO : If could speak so wisely under an arrest , I would send for certain of my creditors : and yet , to say the truth , I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment . What 's thy offence , Claudio ?
CLAUDIO : What but to speak of would offend again .
LUCIO : What , is 't murder ?
CLAUDIO : No .
LUCIO : Lechery ?
CLAUDIO : Call it so .
Provost : Away , sir ! you must go .
CLAUDIO : One word , good friend . Lucio , a word with you .
LUCIO : A hundred , if they 'll do you any good . Is lechery so look 'd after ?
CLAUDIO : Thus stands it with me : upon a true contract I got possession of Julietta 's bed : You know the lady ; she is fast my wife , Save that we do the denunciation lack Of outward order : this we came not to , Only for propagation of a dower Remaining in the coffer of her friends , From whom we thought it meet to hide our love Till time had made them for us . But it chances The stealth of our most mutual entertainment With character too gross is writ on Juliet .
LUCIO : With child , perhaps ?
