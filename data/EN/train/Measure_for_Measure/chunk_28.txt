ESCALUS : I shall , sir . Fare you well .
ANGELO : Good night . Exit ESCALUS This deed unshapes me quite , makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings . A deflower 'd maid ! And by an eminent body that enforced The law against it ! But that her tender shame Will not proclaim against her maiden loss , How might she tongue me ! Yet reason dares her no ; For my authority bears of a credent bulk , That no particular scandal once can touch But it confounds the breather . He should have lived , Save that riotous youth , with dangerous sense , Might in the times to come have ta 'en revenge , By so receiving a dishonour 'd life With ransom of such shame . Would yet he had lived ! A lack , when once our grace we have forgot , Nothing goes right : we would , and we would not . Exit Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit , and FRIAR PETER
DUKE VINCENTIO : These letters at fit time deliver me Giving letters The provost knows our purpose and our plot . The matter being afoot , keep your instruction , And hold you ever to our special drift ; Though sometimes you do blench from this to that , As cause doth minister . Go call at Flavius ' house , And tell him where I stay : give the like notice To Valentinus , Rowland , and to Crassus , And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate ; But send me Flavius first .
FRIAR PETER : It shall be speeded well . Exit Enter VARRIUS
DUKE VINCENTIO : I thank thee , Varrius ; thou hast made good haste : Come , we will walk . There 's other of our friends Will greet us here anon , my gentle Varrius . Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA
ISABELLA : To speak so indirectly I am loath : I would say the truth ; but to accuse him so , That is your part : yet I am advised to do it ; He says , to veil full purpose .
MARIANA : Be ruled by him .
ISABELLA : Besides , he tells me that , if peradventure He speak against me on the adverse side , I should not think it strange ; for ' tis a physic That 's bitter to sweet end .
MARIANA : I would Friar Peter--
ISABELLA : O , peace ! the friar is come . Enter FRIAR PETER
FRIAR PETER : Come , I have found you out a stand most fit , Where you may have such vantage on the duke , He shall not pass you . Twice have the trumpets sounded ; The generous and gravest citizens Have hent the gates , and very near upon The duke is entering : therefore , hence , away ! MARIANA veiled , ISABELLA , and FRIAR PETER , at their stand . Enter DUKE VINCENTIO , VARRIUS , Lords , ANGELO , ESCALUS , LUCIO , Provost , Officers , and Citizens , at several doors
DUKE VINCENTIO : My very worthy cousin , fairly met ! Our old and faithful friend , we are glad to see you .
ANGELO ESCALUS : Happy return be to your royal grace !
DUKE VINCENTIO : Many and hearty thankings to you both . We have made inquiry of you ; and we hear Such goodness of your justice , that our soul Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks , Forerunning more requital .
ANGELO : You make my bonds still greater .
DUKE VINCENTIO : O , your desert speaks loud ; and I should wrong it , To lock it in the wards of covert bosom , When it deserves , with characters of brass , A forted residence ' gainst the tooth of time And razure of oblivion . Give me your hand , And let the subject see , to make them know That outward courtesies would fain proclaim Favours that keep within . Come , Escalus , You must walk by us on our other hand ; And good supporters are you . FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward
FRIAR PETER : Now is your time : speak loud and kneel before him .
