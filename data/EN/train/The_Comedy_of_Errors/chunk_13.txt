OF EPHESUS : I am not furnish 'd with the present money ; Besides , I have some business in the town . Good signior , take the stranger to my house And with you take the chain and bid my wife Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof : Perchance I will be there as soon as you .
ANGELO : Then you will bring the chain to her yourself ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : No ; bear it with you , lest I come not time enough .
ANGELO : Well , sir , I will . Have you the chain about you ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : An if I have not , sir , I hope you have ; Or else you may return without your money .
ANGELO : Nay , come , I pray you , sir , give me the chain : Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , And I , to blame , have held him here too long . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Good Lord ! you use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine . I should have chid you for not bringing it , But , like a shrew , you first begin to brawl .
Second Merchant : The hour steals on ; I pray you , sir , dispatch .
ANGELO : You hear how he importunes me ; --the chain ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Why , give it to my wife and fetch your money .
ANGELO : Come , come , you know I gave it you even now . Either send the chain or send me by some token . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Fie , now you run this humour out of breath , where 's the chain ? I pray you , let me see it .
Second Merchant : My business cannot brook this dalliance . Good sir , say whether you 'll answer me or no : If not , I 'll leave him to the officer . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I answer you ! what should I answer you ?
ANGELO : The money that you owe me for the chain . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I owe you none till I receive the chain .
ANGELO : You know I gave it you half an hour since . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : You gave me none : you wrong me much to say so .
ANGELO : You wrong me more , sir , in denying it : Consider how it stands upon my credit .
Second Merchant : Well , officer , arrest him at my suit .
Officer : I do ; and charge you in the duke 's name to obey me .
ANGELO : This touches me in reputation . Either consent to pay this sum for me Or I attach you by this officer . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Consent to pay thee that I never had ! Arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou darest .
ANGELO : Here is thy fee ; arrest him , officer , I would not spare my brother in this case , If he should scorn me so apparently .
Officer : I do arrest you , sir : you hear the suit . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I do obey thee till I give thee bail . But , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer .
ANGELO : Sir , sir , I will have law in Ephesus , To your notorious shame ; I doubt it not . Enter DROMIO of Syracuse , from the bay
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Master , there is a bark of Epidamnum That stays but till her owner comes aboard , And then , sir , she bears away . Our fraughtage , sir , I have convey 'd aboard ; and I have bought The oil , the balsamum and aqua-vitae . The ship is in her trim ; the merry wind Blows fair from land : they stay for nought at all But for their owner , master , and yourself . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : How now ! a madman ! Why , thou peevish sheep , What ship of Epidamnum stays for me ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : A ship you sent me to , to hire waftage . ANTIPHOLUS
