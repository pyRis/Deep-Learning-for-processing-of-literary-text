ANGELO : My lord , in truth , thus far I witness with him , That he dined not at home , but was lock 'd out .
DUKE SOLINUS : But had he such a chain of thee or no ?
ANGELO : He had , my lord : and when he ran in here , These people saw the chain about his neck .
Second Merchant : Besides , I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart : And thereupon I drew my sword on you ; And then you fled into this abbey here , From whence , I think , you are come by miracle . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I never came within these abbey-walls , Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me : I never saw the chain , so help me Heaven ! And this is false you burden me withal .
DUKE SOLINUS : Why , what an intricate impeach is this ! I think you all have drunk of Circe 's cup . If here you housed him , here he would have been ; If he were mad , he would not plead so coldly : You say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here Denies that saying . Sirrah , what say you ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Sir , he dined with her there , at the Porpentine .
Courtezan : He did , and from my finger snatch 'd that ring . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : ' Tis true , my liege ; this ring I had of her .
DUKE SOLINUS : Saw 'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?
Courtezan : As sure , my liege , as I do see your grace .
DUKE SOLINUS : Why , this is strange . Go call the abbess hither . I think you are all mated or stark mad . Exit one to Abbess
AEGEON : Most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word : Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me .
DUKE SOLINUS : Speak freely , Syracusian , what thou wilt .
AEGEON : Is not your name , sir , call 'd Antipholus ? And is not that your bondman , Dromio ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Within this hour I was his bondman sir , But he , I thank him , gnaw 'd in two my cords : Now am I Dromio and his man unbound .
AEGEON : I am sure you both of you remember me .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Ourselves we do remember , sir , by you ; For lately we were bound , as you are now You are not Pinch 's patient , are you , sir ?
AEGEON : Why look you strange on me ? you know me well .
ANTIPHOLUS : I never saw you in my life till now .
AEGEON : O , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , And careful hours with time 's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face : But tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Neither .
AEGEON : Dromio , nor thou ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : No , trust me , sir , nor I.
AEGEON : I am sure thou dost .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Ay , sir , but I am sure I do not ; and whatsoever a man denies , you are now bound to believe him .
AEGEON : Not know my voice ! O time 's extremity , Hast thou so crack 'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years , that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ? Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter 's drizzled snow , And all the conduits of my blood froze up , Yet hath my night of life some memory , My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , My dull deaf ears a little use to hear : All these old witnesses--I cannot err-- Tell me thou art my son Antipholus . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I never saw my father in my life .
