DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : You sent me for a rope 's end as soon : You sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed . To Adriana , villain , hie thee straight : Give her this key , and tell her , in the desk That 's cover 'd o 'er with Turkish tapestry , There is a purse of ducats ; let her send it : Tell her I am arrested in the street And that shall bail me ; hie thee , slave , be gone ! On , officer , to prison till it come .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : To Adriana ! that is where we dined , Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband : She is too big , I hope , for me to compass . Thither I must , although against my will , For servants must their masters ' minds fulfil . Exit Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA : Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so ? Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest ? yea or no ? Look 'd he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ? What observation madest thou in this case Of his heart 's meteors tilting in his face ?
LUCIANA : First he denied you had in him no right .
ADRIANA : He meant he did me none ; the more my spite .
LUCIANA : Then swore he that he was a stranger here .
ADRIANA : And true he swore , though yet forsworn he were .
LUCIANA : Then pleaded I for you .
ADRIANA : And what said he ?
LUCIANA : That love I begg 'd for you he begg 'd of me .
ADRIANA : With what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
LUCIANA : With words that in an honest suit might move . First he did praise my beauty , then my speech .
ADRIANA : Didst speak him fair ?
LUCIANA : Have patience , I beseech .
ADRIANA : I cannot , nor I will not , hold me still ; My tongue , though not my heart , shall have his will . He is deformed , crooked , old and sere , Ill-faced , worse bodied , shapeless everywhere ; Vicious , ungentle , foolish , blunt , unkind ; Stigmatical in making , worse in mind .
LUCIANA : Who would be jealous then of such a one ? No evil lost is wail 'd when it is gone .
ADRIANA : Ah , but I think him better than I say , And yet would herein others ' eyes were worse . Far from her nest the lapwing cries away : My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse . Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Here ! go ; the desk , the purse ! sweet , now , make haste .
LUCIANA : How hast thou lost thy breath ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : By running fast .
ADRIANA : Where is thy master , Dromio ? is he well ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No , he 's in Tartar limbo , worse than hell . A devil in an everlasting garment hath him ; One whose hard heart is button 'd up with steel ; A fiend , a fury , pitiless and rough ; A wolf , nay , worse , a fellow all in buff ; A back-friend , a shoulder-clapper , one that countermands The passages of alleys , creeks and narrow lands ; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well ; One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell .
ADRIANA : Why , man , what is the matter ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I do not know the matter : he is ' rested on the case .
ADRIANA : What , is he arrested ? Tell me at whose suit .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I know not at whose suit he is arrested well ; But he 's in a suit of buff which ' rested him , that can I tell . Will you send him , mistress , redemption , the money in his desk ?
