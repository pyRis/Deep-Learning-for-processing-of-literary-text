OF EPHESUS : The duke and all that know me in the city Can witness with me that it is not so I ne 'er saw Syracusa in my life .
DUKE SOLINUS : I tell thee , Syracusian , twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus , During which time he ne 'er saw Syracusa : I see thy age and dangers make thee dote . Re-enter AEMILIA , with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
AEMELIA : Most mighty duke , behold a man much wrong 'd . All gather to see them
ADRIANA : I see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
DUKE SOLINUS : One of these men is Genius to the other ; And so of these . Which is the natural man , And which the spirit ? who deciphers them ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I , sir , am Dromio ; command him away .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I , sir , am Dromio ; pray , let me stay . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : AEgeon art thou not ? or else his ghost ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : O , my old master ! who hath bound him here ?
AEMELIA : Whoever bound him , I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty . Speak , old AEgeon , if thou be 'st the man That hadst a wife once call 'd AEmilia That bore thee at a burden two fair sons : O , if thou be 'st the same AEgeon , speak , And speak unto the same AEmilia !
AEGEON : If I dream not , thou art AEmilia : If thou art she , tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
AEMELIA : By men of Epidamnum he and I And the twin Dromio all were taken up ; But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them And me they left with those of Epidamnum . What then became of them I cannot tell I to this fortune that you see me in .
DUKE SOLINUS : Why , here begins his morning story right ; These two Antipholuses , these two so like , And these two Dromios , one in semblance , -- Besides her urging of her wreck at sea , -- These are the parents to these children , Which accidentally are met together . Antipholus , thou camest from Corinth first ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : No , sir , not I ; I came from Syracuse .
DUKE SOLINUS : Stay , stand apart ; I know not which is which . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I came from Corinth , my most gracious lord , --
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : And I with him . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Brought to this town by that most famous warrior , Duke Menaphon , your most renowned uncle .
ADRIANA : Which of you two did dine with me to-day ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I , gentle mistress .
ADRIANA : And are not you my husband ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : No ; I say nay to that . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : And so do I ; yet did she call me so : And this fair gentlewoman , her sister here , Did call me brother . To Luciana What I told you then , I hope I shall have leisure to make good ; If this be not a dream I see and hear .
ANGELO : That is the chain , sir , which you had of me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I think it be , sir ; I deny it not . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : And you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
ANGELO : I think I did , sir ; I deny it not .
ADRIANA : I sent you money , sir , to be your bail , By Dromio ; but I think he brought it not .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : No , none by me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio , my man , did bring them me . I see we still did meet each other 's man , And I was ta 'en for him , and he for me , And thereupon these errors are arose . ANTIPHOLUS
