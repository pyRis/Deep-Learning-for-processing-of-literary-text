LUCIANA : O , soft , air ! hold you still : I 'll fetch my sister , to get her good will . Exit Enter DROMIO of Syracuse ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Why , how now , Dromio ! where runn 'st thou so fast ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Do you know me , sir ? am I Dromio ? am I your man ? am I myself ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I am an ass , I am a woman 's man and besides myself .
ANTIPHOLUS : What woman 's man ? and how besides thyself ? besides thyself ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , sir , besides myself , I am due to a woman ; one that claims me , one that haunts me , one that will have me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What claim lays she to thee ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry sir , such claim as you would lay to your horse ; and she would have me as a beast : not that , I being a beast , she would have me ; but that she , being a very beastly creature , lays claim to me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What is she ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : A very reverent body ; ay , such a one as a man may not speak of without he say ' Sir-reverence . ' I have but lean luck in the match , and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : How dost thou mean a fat marriage ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , sir , she 's the kitchen wench and all grease ; and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light . I warrant , her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter : if she lives till doomsday , she 'll burn a week longer than the whole world . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What complexion is she of ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Swart , like my shoe , but her face nothing half so clean kept : for why , she sweats ; a man may go over shoes in the grime of it . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : That 's a fault that water will mend .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No , sir , ' tis in grain ; Noah 's flood could not do it . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What 's her name ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Nell , sir ; but her name and three quarters , that 's an ell and three quarters , will not measure her from hip to hip . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Then she bears some breadth ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip : she is spherical , like a globe ; I could find out countries in her . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : In what part of her body stands Ireland ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , in her buttocks : I found it out by the bogs . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where Scotland ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I found it by the barrenness ; hard in the palm of the hand . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where France ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : In her forehead ; armed and reverted , making war against her heir . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where England ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I looked for the chalky cliffs , but I could find no whiteness in them ; but I guess it stood in her chin , by the salt rheum that ran between France and it . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where Spain ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Faith , I saw it not ; but I felt it hot in her breath . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where America , the Indies ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Oh , sir , upon her nose all o 'er embellished with rubies , carbuncles , sapphires , declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain ; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Where stood Belgia , the Netherlands ?
