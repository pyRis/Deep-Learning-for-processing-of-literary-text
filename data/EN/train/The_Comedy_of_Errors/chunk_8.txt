DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Say what you will , sir , but I know what I know ; That you beat me at the mart , I have your hand to show : If the skin were parchment , and the blows you gave were ink , Your own handwriting would tell you what I think . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : I think thou art an ass .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Marry , so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear . I should kick , being kick 'd ; and , being at that pass , You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : You 're sad , Signior Balthazar : pray God our cheer May answer my good will and your good welcome here .
BALTHAZAR : I hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : O , Signior Balthazar , either at flesh or fish , A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish .
BALTHAZAR : Good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : And welcome more common ; for that 's nothing but words .
BALTHAZAR : Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Ay , to a niggardly host , and more sparing guest : But though my cates be mean , take them in good part ; Better cheer may you have , but not with better heart . But , soft ! my door is lock 'd . Go bid them let us in .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Maud , Bridget , Marian , Cicel , Gillian , Ginn !
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Mome , malt-horse , capon , coxcomb , idiot , patch ! Either get thee from the door , or sit down at the hatch . Dost thou conjure for wenches , that thou call 'st for such store , When one is one too many ? Go , get thee from the door .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : What patch is made our porter ? My master stays in the street .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Let him walk from whence he came , lest he catch cold on 's feet . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Who talks within there ? ho , open the door !
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Right , sir ; I 'll tell you when , an you tell me wherefore . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Wherefore ? for my dinner : I have not dined to-day .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Nor to-day here you must not ; come again when you may . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : The porter for this time , sir , and my name is Dromio .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : O villain ! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name . The one ne 'er got me credit , the other mickle blame . If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place , Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy name for an ass .
LUCE : What a coil is there , Dromio ? who are those at the gate ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Let my master in , Luce .
LUCE : Faith , no ; he comes too late ; And so tell your master .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : O Lord , I must laugh ! Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff ?
LUCE : Have at you with another ; that 's--When ? can you tell ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : If thy name be call 'd Luce--Luce , thou hast answered him well .
ANTIPHOLUS : Do you hear , you minion ? you 'll let us in , I hope ? OF EPHESUS
LUCE : I thought to have asked you .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : And you said no .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : So , come , help : well struck ! there was blow for blow . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Thou baggage , let me in .
LUCE : Can you tell for whose sake ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Master , knock the door hard .
LUCE : Let him knock till it ache . ANTIPHOLUS
