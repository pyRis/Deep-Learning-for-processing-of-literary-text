DUKE SOLINUS : It shall not need ; thy father hath his life .
Courtezan : Sir , I must have that diamond from you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : There , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
AEMELIA : Renowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes : And all that are assembled in this place , That by this sympathized one day 's error Have suffer 'd wrong , go keep us company , And we shall make full satisfaction . Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you , my sons ; and till this present hour My heavy burden ne 'er delivered . The duke , my husband and my children both , And you the calendars of their nativity , Go to a gossips ' feast and go with me ; After so long grief , such festivity !
DUKE SOLINUS : With all my heart , I 'll gossip at this feast. of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Master , shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embark 'd ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Your goods that lay at host , sir , in the Centaur . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : He speaks to me . I am your master , Dromio : Come , go with us ; we 'll look to that anon : Embrace thy brother there ; rejoice with him .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : There is a fat friend at your master 's house , That kitchen 'd me for you to-day at dinner : She now shall be my sister , not my wife .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Methinks you are my glass , and not my brother : I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth . Will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Not I , sir ; you are my elder .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : That 's a question : how shall we try it ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : We 'll draw cuts for the senior : till then lead thou first .
