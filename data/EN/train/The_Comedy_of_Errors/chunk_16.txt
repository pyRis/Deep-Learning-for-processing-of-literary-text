Courtezan : Your man and you are marvellous merry , sir . Will you go with me ? We 'll mend our dinner here ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Master , if you do , expect spoon-meat ; or bespeak a long spoon . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Why , Dromio ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Avoid then , fiend ! what tell 'st thou me of supping ? Thou art , as you are all , a sorceress : I conjure thee to leave me and be gone .
Courtezan : Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner , Or , for my diamond , the chain you promised , And I 'll be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Some devils ask but the parings of one 's nail , A rush , a hair , a drop of blood , a pin , A nut , a cherry-stone ; But she , more covetous , would have a chain . Master , be wise : an if you give it her , The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it .
Courtezan : I pray you , sir , my ring , or else the chain : I hope you do not mean to cheat me so . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Avaunt , thou witch ! Come , Dromio , let us go .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : ' Fly pride , ' says the peacock : mistress , that you know .
Courtezan : Now , out of doubt Antipholus is mad , Else would he never so demean himself . A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain : Both one and other he denies me now . The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner , Of his own doors being shut against his entrance . Belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , On purpose shut the doors against his way . My way is now to hie home to his house , And tell his wife that , being lunatic , He rush 'd into my house and took perforce My ring away . This course I fittest choose ; For forty ducats is too much to lose . Exit Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Fear me not , man ; I will not break away : I 'll give thee , ere I leave thee , so much money , To warrant thee , as I am ' rested for . My wife is in a wayward mood to-day , And will not lightly trust the messenger That I should be attach 'd in Ephesus , I tell you , ' twill sound harshly in her ears . Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope 's-end Here comes my man ; I think he brings the money . How now , sir ! have you that I sent you for ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Here 's that , I warrant you , will pay them all . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : But where 's the money ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Why , sir , I gave the money for the rope . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Five hundred ducats , villain , for a rope ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I 'll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : To what end did I bid thee hie thee home ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : To a rope 's-end , sir ; and to that end am I returned . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : And to that end , sir , I will welcome you . Beating him
Officer : Good sir , be patient .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Nay , ' tis for me to be patient ; I am in adversity .
Officer : Good , now , hold thy tongue .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Thou whoreson , senseless villain !
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I would I were senseless , sir , that I might not feel your blows .
