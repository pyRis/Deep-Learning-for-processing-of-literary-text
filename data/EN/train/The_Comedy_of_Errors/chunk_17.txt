DROMIO OF EPHESUS : I am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears . I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows . When I am cold , he heats me with beating ; when I am warm , he cools me with beating ; I am waked with it when I sleep ; raised with it when I sit ; driven out of doors with it when I go from home ; welcomed home with it when I return ; nay , I bear it on my shoulders , as a beggar wont her brat ; and , I think when he hath lamed me , I shall beg with it from door to door . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Come , go along ; my wife is coming yonder . Enter ADRIANA , LUCIANA , the Courtezan , and PINCH
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Mistress , ' respice finem , ' respect your end ; or rather , the prophecy like the parrot , ' beware the rope 's-end . ' ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Wilt thou still talk ? Beating him
Courtezan : How say you now ? is not your husband mad ?
ADRIANA : His incivility confirms no less . Good Doctor Pinch , you are a conjurer ; Establish him in his true sense again , And I will please you what you will demand .
LUCIANA : Alas , how fiery and how sharp he looks !
Courtezan : Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy !
PINCH : Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : There is my hand , and let it feel your ear . Striking him
PINCH : I charge thee , Satan , housed within this man , To yield possession to my holy prayers And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight : I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Peace , doting wizard , peace ! I am not mad .
ADRIANA : O , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : You minion , you , are these your customers ? Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house to-day , Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house ?
ADRIANA : O husband , God doth know you dined at home ; Where would you had remain 'd until this time , Free from these slanders and this open shame ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Dined at home ! Thou villain , what sayest thou ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Were not my doors lock 'd up and I shut out ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Perdie , your doors were lock 'd and you shut out . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : And did not she herself revile me there ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Sans fable , she herself reviled you there . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Did not her kitchen-maid rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Certes , she did ; the kitchen-vestal scorn 'd you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : And did not I in rage depart from thence ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : In verity you did ; my bones bear witness , That since have felt the vigour of his rage .
ADRIANA : Is 't good to soothe him in these contraries ?
PINCH : It is no shame : the fellow finds his vein , And yielding to him humours well his frenzy . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Thou hast suborn 'd the goldsmith to arrest me .
ADRIANA : Alas , I sent you money to redeem you , By Dromio here , who came in haste for it .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Money by me ! heart and goodwill you might ; But surely master , not a rag of money . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Went 'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
ADRIANA : He came to me and I deliver 'd it .
LUCIANA : And I am witness with her that she did .
