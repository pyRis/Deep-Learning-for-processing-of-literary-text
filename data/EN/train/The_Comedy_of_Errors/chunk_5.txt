DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : What answer , sir ? when spake I such a word ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Even now , even here , not half an hour since .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I did not see you since you sent me hence , Home to the Centaur , with the gold you gave me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Villain , thou didst deny the gold 's receipt , And told 'st me of a mistress and a dinner ; For which , I hope , thou felt 'st I was displeased .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I am glad to see you in this merry vein : What means this jest ? I pray you , master , tell me . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ? Think 'st thou I jest ? Hold , take thou that , and that . Beating him
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Hold , sir , for God 's sake ! now your jest is earnest : Upon what bargain do you give it me ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you , Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours . When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport , But creep in crannies when he hides his beams . If you will jest with me , know my aspect , And fashion your demeanor to my looks , Or I will beat this method in your sconce .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Sconce call you it ? so you would leave battering , I had rather have it a head : an you use these blows long , I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too ; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders . But , I pray , sir why am I beaten ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Dost thou not know ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Nothing , sir , but that I am beaten . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Shall I tell you why ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Ay , sir , and wherefore ; for they say every why hath a wherefore . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Why , first , --for flouting me ; and then , wherefore-- For urging it the second time to me .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season , When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason ? Well , sir , I thank you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Thank me , sir , for what ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I 'll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something . But say , sir , is it dinner-time ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No , sir ; I think the meat wants that I have . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : In good time , sir ; what 's that ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Basting . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Well , sir , then ' twill be dry .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : If it be , sir , I pray you , eat none of it . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Your reason ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Well , sir , learn to jest in good time : there 's a time for all things .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I durst have denied that , before you were so choleric . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : By what rule , sir ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father Time himself . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Let 's hear it .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : There 's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : May he not do it by fine and recovery ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Yes , to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Why is Time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
