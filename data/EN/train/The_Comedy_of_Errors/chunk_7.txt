OF SYRACUSE : Did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ? What is the course and drift of your compact ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I , sir ? I never saw her till this time . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Villain , thou liest ; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I never spake with her in all my life . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : How can she thus then call us by our names , Unless it be by inspiration .
ADRIANA : How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave , Abetting him to thwart me in my mood ! Be it my wrong you are from me exempt , But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt . Come , I will fasten on this sleeve of thine : Thou art an elm , my husband , I a vine , Whose weakness , married to thy stronger state , Makes me with thy strength to communicate : If aught possess thee from me , it is dross , Usurping ivy , brier , or idle moss ; Who , all for want of pruning , with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : To me she speaks ; she moves me for her theme : What , was I married to her in my dream ? Or sleep I now and think I hear all this ? What error drives our eyes and ears amiss ? Until I know this sure uncertainty , I 'll entertain the offer 'd fallacy .
LUCIANA : Dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : O , for my beads ! I cross me for a sinner . This is the fairy land : O spite of spites ! We talk with goblins , owls and sprites : If we obey them not , this will ensue , They 'll suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
LUCIANA : Why pratest thou to thyself and answer 'st not ? Dromio , thou drone , thou snail , thou slug , thou sot !
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : I am transformed , master , am I not ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I think thou art in mind , and so am I.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Nay , master , both in mind and in my shape . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Thou hast thine own form .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No , I am an ape .
LUCIANA : If thou art changed to aught , ' tis to an ass .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : ' Tis true ; she rides me and I long for grass . ' Tis so , I am an ass ; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me .
ADRIANA : Come , come , no longer will I be a fool , To put the finger in the eye and weep , Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn . Come , sir , to dinner . Dromio , keep the gate . Husband , I 'll dine above with you to-day And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks . Sirrah , if any ask you for your master , Say he dines forth , and let no creature enter . Come , sister . Dromio , play the porter well . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Am I in earth , in heaven , or in hell ? Sleeping or waking ? mad or well-advised ? Known unto these , and to myself disguised ! I 'll say as they say and persever so , And in this mist at all adventures go .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Master , shall I be porter at the gate ?
ADRIANA : Ay ; and let none enter , lest I break your pate .
LUCIANA : Come , come , Antipholus , we dine too late . Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus , DROMIO of Ephesus , ANGELO , and BALTHAZAR ANTIPHOLUS
