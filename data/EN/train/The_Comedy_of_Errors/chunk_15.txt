DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Not on a band , but on a stronger thing ; A chain , a chain ! Do you not hear it ring ?
ADRIANA : What , the chain ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No , no , the bell : ' tis time that I were gone : It was two ere I left him , and now the clock strikes one .
ADRIANA : The hours come back ! that did I never hear .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : O , yes ; if any hour meet a sergeant , a ' turns back for very fear .
ADRIANA : As if Time were in debt ! how fondly dost thou reason !
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Time is a very bankrupt , and owes more than he 's worth , to season . Nay , he 's a thief too : have you not heard men say That Time comes stealing on by night and day ? If Time be in debt and theft , and a sergeant in the way , Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day ? Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse
ADRIANA : Go , Dromio ; there 's the money , bear it straight ; And bring thy master home immediately . Come , sister : I am press 'd down with conceit-- Conceit , my comfort and my injury . Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : There 's not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend ; And every one doth call me by my name . Some tender money to me ; some invite me ; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses ; Some offer me commodities to buy : Even now a tailor call 'd me in his shop And show 'd me silks that he had bought for me , And therewithal took measure of my body . Sure , these are but imaginary wiles And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here . Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Master , here 's the gold you sent me for . What , have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What gold is this ? what Adam dost thou mean ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam that keeps the prison : he that goes in the calf 's skin that was killed for the Prodigal ; he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I understand thee not .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : No ? why , ' tis a plain case : he that went , like a bass-viol , in a case of leather ; the man , sir , that , when gentlemen are tired , gives them a sob and ' rests them ; he , sir , that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance ; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : What , thou meanest an officer ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Ay , sir , the sergeant of the band , he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band ; one that thinks a man always going to bed , and says , ' God give you good rest ! ' ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Well , sir , there rest in your foolery . Is there any
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Why , sir , I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night ; and then were you hindered by the sergeant , to tarry for the hoy Delay . Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : The fellow is distract , and so am I ; And here we wander in illusions : Some blessed power deliver us from hence ! Enter a Courtezan
Courtezan : Well met , well met , Master Antipholus . I see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now : Is that the chain you promised me to-day ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Satan , avoid ! I charge thee , tempt me not .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Master , is this Mistress Satan ? ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : It is the devil .
