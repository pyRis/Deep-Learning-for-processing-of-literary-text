OF SYRACUSE : Why , but there 's many a man hath more hair than wit .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : The plainer dealer , the sooner lost : yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : For what reason ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : For two ; and sound ones too . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Nay , not sound , I pray you .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Sure ones , then . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Certain ones then . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Name them .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : The one , to save the money that he spends in trimming ; the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Marry , and did , sir ; namely , no time to recover hair lost by nature . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : But your reason was not substantial , why there is no time to recover .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Thus I mend it : Time himself is bald and therefore to the world 's end will have bald followers . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I knew ' twould be a bald conclusion : But , soft ! who wafts us yonder ? Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA : Ay , ay , Antipholus , look strange and frown : Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects ; I am not Adriana nor thy wife . The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear , That never object pleasing in thine eye , That never touch well welcome to thy hand , That never meat sweet-savor 'd in thy taste , Unless I spake , or look 'd , or touch 'd , or carved to thee . How comes it now , my husband , O , how comes it , That thou art thus estranged from thyself ? Thyself I call it , being strange to me , That , undividable , incorporate , Am better than thy dear self 's better part . Ah , do not tear away thyself from me ! For know , my love , as easy mayest thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf , And take unmingled that same drop again , Without addition or diminishing , As take from me thyself and not me too . How dearly would it touch me to the quick , Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body , consecrate to thee , By ruffian lust should be contaminate ! Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the stain 'd skin off my harlot-brow And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring And break it with a deep-divorcing vow ? I know thou canst ; and therefore see thou do it . I am possess 'd with an adulterate blot ; My blood is mingled with the crime of lust : For if we too be one and thou play false , I do digest the poison of thy flesh , Being strumpeted by thy contagion . Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed ; I live unstain 'd , thou undishonoured . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Plead you to me , fair dame ? I know you not : In Ephesus I am but two hours old , As strange unto your town as to your talk ; Who , every word by all my wit being scann 'd , Want wit in all one word to understand .
LUCIANA : Fie , brother ! how the world is changed with you ! When were you wont to use my sister thus ? She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : By Dromio ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : By me ?
