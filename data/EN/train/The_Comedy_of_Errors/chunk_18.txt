PINCH : Mistress , both man and master is possess 'd ; I know it by their pale and deadly looks : They must be bound and laid in some dark room . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Say , wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day ? And why dost thou deny the bag of gold ?
ADRIANA : I did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : And , gentle master , I received no gold ; But I confess , sir , that we were lock 'd out .
ADRIANA : Dissembling villain , thou speak 'st false in both . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Dissembling harlot , thou art false in all ; And art confederate with a damned pack To make a loathsome abject scorn of me : But with these nails I 'll pluck out these false eyes That would behold in me this shameful sport . Enter three or four , and offer to bind him . He strives
ADRIANA : O , bind him , bind him ! let him not come near me .
PINCH : More company ! The fiend is strong within him .
LUCIANA : Ay me , poor man , how pale and wan he looks ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : What , will you murder me ? Thou gaoler , thou , I am thy prisoner : wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue ?
Officer : Masters , let him go He is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
PINCH : Go bind this man , for he is frantic too . They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus
ADRIANA : What wilt thou do , thou peevish officer ? Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself ?
Officer : He is my prisoner : if I let him go , The debt he owes will be required of me .
ADRIANA : I will discharge thee ere I go from thee : Bear me forthwith unto his creditor , And , knowing how the debt grows , I will pay it . Good master doctor , see him safe convey 'd Home to my house . O most unhappy day ! ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : O most unhappy strumpet !
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Master , I am here entered in bond for you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Out on thee , villain ! wherefore dost thou mad me ?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Will you be bound for nothing ? be mad , good master : cry ' The devil ! '
LUCIANA : God help , poor souls , how idly do they talk !
ADRIANA : Go bear him hence . Sister , go you with me . Say now , whose suit is he arrested at ?
Officer : One Angelo , a goldsmith : do you know him ?
ADRIANA : I know the man . What is the sum he owes ?
Officer : Two hundred ducats .
ADRIANA : Say , how grows it due ?
Officer : Due for a chain your husband had of him .
ADRIANA : He did bespeak a chain for me , but had it not .
Courtezan : When as your husband all in rage to-day Came to my house and took away my ring-- The ring I saw upon his finger now-- Straight after did I meet him with a chain .
ADRIANA : It may be so , but I did never see it . Come , gaoler , bring me where the goldsmith is : I long to know the truth hereof at large . Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn , and DROMIO of Syracuse
LUCIANA : God , for thy mercy ! they are loose again .
ADRIANA : And come with naked swords . Let 's call more help to have them bound again .
Officer : Away ! they 'll kill us . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : I see these witches are afraid of swords .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : She that would be your wife now ran from you . ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE : Come to the Centaur ; fetch our stuff from thence : I long that we were safe and sound aboard .
