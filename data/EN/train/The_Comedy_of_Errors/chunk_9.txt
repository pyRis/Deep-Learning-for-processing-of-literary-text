LUCE : What needs all that , and a pair of stocks in the town ?
ADRIANA : Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise ?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : By my troth , your town is troubled with unruly boys . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Are you there , wife ? you might have come before .
ADRIANA : Your wife , sir knave ! go get you from the door .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : If you went in pain , master , this ' knave ' would go sore .
ANGELO : Here is neither cheer , sir , nor welcome : we would fain have either .
BALTHAZAR : In debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : They stand at the door , master ; bid them welcome hither . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : There is something in the wind , that we cannot get in .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : You would say so , master , if your garments were thin . Your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold : It would make a man mad as a buck , to be so bought and sold . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Go fetch me something : I 'll break ope the gate .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Break any breaking here , and I 'll break your knave 's pate .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : A man may break a word with you , sir , and words are but wind , Ay , and break it in your face , so he break it not behind .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : It seems thou want 'st breaking : out upon thee , hind !
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : Here 's too much ' out upon thee ! ' I pray thee , let me in .
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE : Ay , when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Well , I 'll break in : go borrow me a crow .
DROMIO OF EPHESUS : A crow without feather ? Master , mean you so ? For a fish without a fin , there 's a fowl without a feather ; If a crow help us in , sirrah , we 'll pluck a crow together . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : Go get thee gone ; fetch me an iron crow .
BALTHAZAR : Have patience , sir ; O , let it not be so ! Herein you war against your reputation And draw within the compass of suspect The unviolated honour of your wife . Once this , --your long experience of her wisdom , Her sober virtue , years and modesty , Plead on her part some cause to you unknown : And doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you . Be ruled by me : depart in patience , And let us to the Tiger all to dinner , And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint . If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day , A vulgar comment will be made of it , And that supposed by the common rout Against your yet ungalled estimation That may with foul intrusion enter in And dwell upon your grave when you are dead ; For slander lives upon succession , For ever housed where it gets possession . ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS : You have prevailed : I will depart in quiet , And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry . I know a wench of excellent discourse , Pretty and witty ; wild , and yet , too , gentle : There will we dine . This woman that I mean , My wife--but , I protest , without desert-- Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal : To her will we to dinner . To Angelo Get you home And fetch the chain ; by this I know ' tis made : Bring it , I pray you , to the Porpentine ; For there 's the house : that chain will I bestow-- Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-- Upon mine hostess there : good sir , make haste . Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me , I 'll knock elsewhere , to see if they 'll disdain me .
