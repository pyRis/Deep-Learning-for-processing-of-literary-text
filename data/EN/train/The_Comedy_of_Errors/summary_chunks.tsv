chunk_0.txt	A merchant named Egeon is arrested for entering the city of Ephesus, because the city is in open conflict with Egeon's home city of Syracuse. Because Egeon cannot afford the 1,000 marks fine, he is sentenced to death by Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus.
chunk_1.txt	Egeon then tells Solinus the tragic tale that brought him to the hostile city. He explains that he and his wife, Emilia, had identical twin sons. They named them both Antipholus and bought two identical slave boys, both named Dromio, to serve them. However, when they were still infants, a shipwreck separated the family. Egeon was rescued with one son and one servant and could only hope that the other son and servant survived with Emilia. When his Antipholus turned eighteen, he set out to search for his lost twin, and when he did not return, Egeon himself set out in search of them both. After many years of searching, he found himself in Ephesus where he was captured. Moved by Egeon's tale, Solinus allows him a day in which to find the money for the fine. 
chunk_2.txt	Antipholus of Syracuse arrives in Ephesus that same day and askes his slave, Dromio, to deposit his purse of 1,000 marks at an inn.
chunk_3.txt	Antiopholus and servant Dromio of Syracuse are instantly mistaken by the townsfolk to be Antipholus and servant Dromio of Ephesus. Antipholus meets Dromio, who denies knowledge of money given to him earlier. Adriana, the wife of Antipholus sends Dromio to find his master. They encounter Antipholus and Dromio. When Dromio of Ephesus returns to home, he reports to Adriana, wife of Antipholus of Ephesus, that Antipholus beat him and denied being married to her.
chunk_4.txt	Adriana becomes upset, believing that this means that her husband is being unfaithful.
chunk_5.txt	Dromio of Syracuse returns to Antipholus of Syracuse who accuses him of joking about marriage. Confused, Dromio denies this and Antipholus beats him.
chunk_6.txt	Adrianna enter with her sister Luciana and explains that she forgives Antipholus and only wants him to return to dine with her.
chunk_7.txt	Although they are confused and afraid, Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse decide to play along and accompany Adriana to her home. He leaves his slave to guard the door.
chunk_8.txt	When Antipholus of Ephesus and his friends arrive at his house, Dromio of Syracuse refuses them entry.
chunk_9.txt	Antipholus of Ephesus is furious and leaves to dine with a courtesan to spite his wife.
chunk_10.txt	Unaware of the events outside, Luciana tells Antipholus of Syracuse to be kinder to Adriana. However, Antipholus says that he does not care for Adriana but is deeply attracted to Luciana herself.
chunk_11.txt	Although she is flattered, Luciana believes the encounter to be immoral and quickly departs. Dromio of Syracuse then returns and says that he is also having troubles with women, having just learned that he is apparently married to an unattractive, greasy kitchen-maid named Nell.
chunk_12.txt	Another confusion occurs when Antipholus of Syracuse receives a gold chain bought by his brother.
chunk_13.txt	When Antipholus of Ephesus refuses to pay for the chain on the grounds that he hasn't received it, he is arrested for debt.
chunk_14.txt	Antipholus of Ephesus tells Dromio of Syracuse to go to Adriana and get money to secure his bail, which he does.
chunk_15.txt	Dromio of Syracuse then mistakenly presents the money to Antipholus of Syracuse who gets increasingly confused. Antipholus of Ephesus's courtesan then arrives and claims that Antipholus owes her a gold chain, which he allegedly promised to her.
chunk_16.txt	Dromio meets the arrested Antipholus, who asks for the money to obtain his release, but Dromio obviously does not have it.
chunk_17.txt	Enraged, Antipholus flogs him. Adriana and Luciana enter, along with the courtesan and a schoolmaster called Doctor Pinch who attempts to exorcise Antipholus.
chunk_18.txt	The attempt is unsuccessful but, when Adriana promises to clear her husband's debts, Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus are tied up and led away to her home.
chunk_19.txt	Adriana and the others then immediately meet Antipholus and Dromio with swords drawn, and, confused by their sudden liberty, flee from them.  Angelo meets Antipholus, sees the chain, and prepares to fight him.

chunk_21.txt	However, after a messenger announces that he has escaped, Antipholus of Ephesus himself enters and begs the Duke for help. All parties tell what has happened from their own point of view. Egeon sees him and believes he is Antipholus of Syracuse.
chunk_22.txt	Antipholus says he has never seen Egeon before.
chunk_23.txt	The abbess enters with Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse and events become clear. Both pairs of twins are reunited, the Abbess reveals that she is, in fact, Emilia, and the Duke pardons Egeon.
