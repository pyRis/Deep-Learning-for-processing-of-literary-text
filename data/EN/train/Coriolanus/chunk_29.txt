CORIOLANUS : O the gods !
COMINIUS : I 'll follow thee a month , devise with thee Where thou shalt rest , that thou mayst hear of us And we of thee : so if the time thrust forth A cause for thy repeal , we shall not send O 'er the vast world to seek a single man , And lose advantage , which doth ever cool I ' the absence of the needer .
CORIOLANUS : Fare ye well : Thou hast years upon thee ; and thou art too full Of the wars ' surfeits , to go rove with one That 's yet unbruised : bring me but out at gate . Come , my sweet wife , my dearest mother , and My friends of noble touch , when I am forth , Bid me farewell , and smile . I pray you , come . While I remain above the ground , you shall Hear from me still , and never of me aught But what is like me formerly .
MENENIUS : That 's worthily As any ear can hear . Come , let 's not weep . If I could shake off but one seven years From these old arms and legs , by the good gods , I 'ld with thee every foot .
CORIOLANUS : Give me thy hand : Come . Enter SICINIUS , BRUTUS , and an AEdile
SICINIUS : Bid them all home ; he 's gone , and we 'll no further . The nobility are vex 'd , whom we see have sided In his behalf .
BRUTUS : Now we have shown our power , Let us seem humbler after it is done Than when it was a-doing .
SICINIUS : Bid them home : Say their great enemy is gone , and they Stand in their ancient strength .
BRUTUS : Dismiss them home . Exit AEdile Here comes his mother .
SICINIUS : Let 's not meet her .
BRUTUS : Why ?
SICINIUS : They say she 's mad .
BRUTUS : They have ta 'en note of us : keep on your way . Enter VOLUMNIA , VIRGILIA , and MENENIUS
VOLUMNIA : O , ye 're well met : the hoarded plague o ' the gods Requite your love !
MENENIUS : Peace , peace ; be not so loud .
VOLUMNIA : If that I could for weeping , you should hear , -- Nay , and you shall hear some . To BRUTUS Will you be gone ?
VIRGILIA : You shall stay too : I would I had the power To say so to my husband .
SICINIUS : Are you mankind ?
VOLUMNIA : Ay , fool ; is that a shame ? Note but this fool . Was not a man my father ? Hadst thou foxship To banish him that struck more blows for Rome Than thou hast spoken words ?
SICINIUS : O blessed heavens !
VOLUMNIA : More noble blows than ever thou wise words ; And for Rome 's good . I 'll tell thee what ; yet go : Nay , but thou shalt stay too : I would my son Were in Arabia , and thy tribe before him , His good sword in his hand .
SICINIUS : What then ?
VIRGILIA : What then ! He 'ld make an end of thy posterity .
VOLUMNIA : Bastards and all . Good man , the wounds that he does bear for Rome !
MENENIUS : Come , come , peace .
SICINIUS : I would he had continued to his country As he began , and not unknit himself The noble knot he made .
BRUTUS : I would he had .
VOLUMNIA : ' I would he had ' ! ' Twas you incensed the rabble : Cats , that can judge as fitly of his worth As I can of those mysteries which heaven Will not have earth to know .
BRUTUS : Pray , let us go .
VOLUMNIA : Now , pray , sir , get you gone : You have done a brave deed . Ere you go , hear this : -- As far as doth the Capitol exceed The meanest house in Rome , so far my son-- This lady 's husband here , this , do you see-- Whom you have banish 'd , does exceed you all .
BRUTUS : Well , well , we 'll leave you .
