BRUTUS : Go about it . Exit AEdile Put him to choler straight : he hath been used Ever to conquer , and to have his worth Of contradiction : being once chafed , he cannot Be rein 'd again to temperance ; then he speaks What 's in his heart ; and that is there which looks With us to break his neck .
SICINIUS : Well , here he comes . Enter CORIOLANUS , MENENIUS , and COMINIUS , with Senators and Patricians
MENENIUS : Calmly , I do beseech you .
CORIOLANUS : Ay , as an ostler , that for the poorest piece Will bear the knave by the volume . The honour 'd gods Keep Rome in safety , and the chairs of justice Supplied with worthy men ! plant love among ' s ! Throng our large temples with the shows of peace , And not our streets with war !
First Senator : Amen , amen .
MENENIUS : A noble wish . Re-enter AEdile , with Citizens
SICINIUS : Draw near , ye people .
AEdile : List to your tribunes . Audience : peace , I say !
CORIOLANUS : First , hear me speak .
Both Tribunes : Well , say . Peace , ho !
CORIOLANUS : Shall I be charged no further than this present ? Must all determine here ?
SICINIUS : I do demand , If you submit you to the people 's voices , Allow their officers and are content To suffer lawful censure for such faults As shall be proved upon you ?
CORIOLANUS : I am content .
MENENIUS : Lo , citizens , he says he is content : The warlike service he has done , consider ; think Upon the wounds his body bears , which show Like graves i ' the holy churchyard .
CORIOLANUS : Scratches with briers , Scars to move laughter only .
MENENIUS : Consider further , That when he speaks not like a citizen , You find him like a soldier : do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds , But , as I say , such as become a soldier , Rather than envy you .
COMINIUS : Well , well , no more .
CORIOLANUS : What is the matter That being pass 'd for consul with full voice , I am so dishonour 'd that the very hour You take it off again ?
SICINIUS : Answer to us .
CORIOLANUS : Say , then : ' tis true , I ought so .
SICINIUS : We charge you , that you have contrived to take From Rome all season 'd office and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical ; For which you are a traitor to the people .
CORIOLANUS : How ! traitor !
MENENIUS : Nay , temperately ; your promise .
CORIOLANUS : The fires i ' the lowest hell fold-in the people ! Call me their traitor ! Thou injurious tribune ! Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths , In thy hand clutch 'd as many millions , in Thy lying tongue both numbers , I would say ' Thou liest ' unto thee with a voice as free As I do pray the gods .
SICINIUS : Mark you this , people ?
Citizens : To the rock , to the rock with him !
SICINIUS : Peace ! We need not put new matter to his charge : What you have seen him do and heard him speak , Beating your officers , cursing yourselves , Opposing laws with strokes and here defying Those whose great power must try him ; even this , So criminal and in such capital kind , Deserves the extremest death .
BRUTUS : But since he hath Served well for Rome , --
CORIOLANUS : What do you prate of service ?
BRUTUS : I talk of that , that know it .
CORIOLANUS : You ?
MENENIUS : Is this the promise that you made your mother ?
COMINIUS : Know , I pray you , --
CORIOLANUS : I know no further : Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death , Vagabond exile , raying , pent to linger But with a grain a day , I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word ; Nor cheque my courage for what they can give , To have 't with saying ' Good morrow . '
