AUFIDIUS : Why , noble lords , Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune , Which was your shame , by this unholy braggart , ' Fore your own eyes and ears ?
All Conspirators : Let him die for 't .
All The People : ' Tear him to pieces . ' ' Do it presently . ' ' He kill 'd my son . ' ' My daughter . ' ' He killed my cousin Marcus . ' ' He killed my father . ' 
Second Lord : Peace , ho ! no outrage : peace ! The man is noble and his fame folds-in This orb o ' the earth . His last offences to us Shall have judicious hearing . Stand , Aufidius , And trouble not the peace .
CORIOLANUS : O that I had him , With six Aufidiuses , or more , his tribe , To use my lawful sword !
AUFIDIUS : Insolent villain !
All Conspirators : Kill , kill , kill , kill , kill him ! The Conspirators draw , and kill CORIOLANUS : AUFIDIUS stands on his body
Lords : Hold , hold , hold , hold !
AUFIDIUS : My noble masters , hear me speak .
First Lord : O Tullus , --
Second Lord : Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep .
Third Lord : Tread not upon him . Masters all , be quiet ; Put up your swords .
AUFIDIUS : My lords , when you shall know--as in this rage , Provoked by him , you cannot--the great danger Which this man 's life did owe you , you 'll rejoice That he is thus cut off . Please it your honours To call me to your senate , I 'll deliver Myself your loyal servant , or endure Your heaviest censure .
First Lord : Bear from hence his body ; And mourn you for him : let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his urn .
Second Lord : His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame . Let 's make the best of it .
