CORIOLANUS : At Antium lives he ?
LARTIUS : At Antium .
CORIOLANUS : I wish I had a cause to seek him there , To oppose his hatred fully . Welcome home . Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS Behold , these are the tribunes of the people , The tongues o ' the common mouth : I do despise them ; For they do prank them in authority , Against all noble sufferance .
SICINIUS : Pass no further .
CORIOLANUS : Ha ! what is that ?
BRUTUS : It will be dangerous to go on : no further .
CORIOLANUS : What makes this change ?
MENENIUS : The matter ?
COMINIUS : Hath he not pass 'd the noble and the common ?
BRUTUS : Cominius , no .
CORIOLANUS : Have I had children 's voices ?
First Senator : Tribunes , give way ; he shall to the market-place .
BRUTUS : The people are incensed against him .
SICINIUS : Stop , Or all will fall in broil .
CORIOLANUS : Are these your herd ? Must these have voices , that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues ? What are your offices ? You being their mouths , why rule you not their teeth ? Have you not set them on ?
MENENIUS : Be calm , be calm .
CORIOLANUS : It is a purposed thing , and grows by plot , To curb the will of the nobility : Suffer 't , and live with such as cannot rule Nor ever will be ruled .
BRUTUS : Call 't not a plot : The people cry you mock 'd them , and of late , When corn was given them gratis , you repined ; Scandal 'd the suppliants for the people , call 'd them Time-pleasers , flatterers , foes to nobleness .
CORIOLANUS : Why , this was known before .
BRUTUS : Not to them all .
CORIOLANUS : Have you inform 'd them sithence ?
BRUTUS : How ! I inform them !
CORIOLANUS : You are like to do such business .
BRUTUS : Not unlike , Each way , to better yours .
CORIOLANUS : Why then should I be consul ? By yond clouds , Let me deserve so ill as you , and make me Your fellow tribune .
SICINIUS : You show too much of that For which the people stir : if you will pass To where you are bound , you must inquire your way , Which you are out of , with a gentler spirit , Or never be so noble as a consul , Nor yoke with him for tribune .
MENENIUS : Let 's be calm .
COMINIUS : The people are abused ; set on . This paltering Becomes not Rome , nor has Coriolanus Deserved this so dishonour 'd rub , laid falsely I ' the plain way of his merit .
CORIOLANUS : Tell me of corn ! This was my speech , and I will speak 't again--
MENENIUS : Not now , not now .
First Senator : Not in this heat , sir , now .
CORIOLANUS : Now , as I live , I will . My nobler friends , I crave their pardons : For the mutable , rank-scented many , let them Regard me as I do not flatter , and Therein behold themselves : I say again , In soothing them , we nourish ' gainst our senate The cockle of rebellion , insolence , sedition , Which we ourselves have plough 'd for , sow 'd , and scatter 'd , By mingling them with us , the honour 'd number , Who lack not virtue , no , nor power , but that Which they have given to beggars .
MENENIUS : Well , no more .
First Senator : No more words , we beseech you .
CORIOLANUS : How ! no more ! As for my country I have shed my blood , Not fearing outward force , so shall my lungs Coin words till their decay against those measles , Which we disdain should tatter us , yet sought The very way to catch them .
BRUTUS : You speak o ' the people , As if you were a god to punish , not A man of their infirmity .
SICINIUS : ' Twere well We let the people know 't .
MENENIUS : What , what ? his choler ?
