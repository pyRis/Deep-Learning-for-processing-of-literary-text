VIRGILIA : O , no , no , no .
VOLUMNIA : O , he is wounded ; I thank the gods for 't .
MENENIUS : So do I too , if it be not too much : brings a ' victory in his pocket ? the wounds become him .
VOLUMNIA : On 's brows : Menenius , he comes the third time home with the oaken garland .
MENENIUS : Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly ?
VOLUMNIA : Titus Lartius writes , they fought together , but Aufidius got off .
MENENIUS : And ' twas time for him too , I 'll warrant him that : an he had stayed by him , I would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in Corioli , and the gold that 's in them . Is the senate possessed of this ?
VOLUMNIA : Good ladies , let 's go . Yes , yes , yes ; the senate has letters from the general , wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war : he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly
VALERIA : In troth , there 's wondrous things spoke of him .
MENENIUS : Wondrous ! ay , I warrant you , and not without his true purchasing .
VIRGILIA : The gods grant them true !
VOLUMNIA : True ! pow , wow .
MENENIUS : True ! I 'll be sworn they are true . Where is he wounded ? To the Tribunes God save your good worships ! Marcius is coming home : he has more cause to be proud . Where is he wounded ?
VOLUMNIA : I ' the shoulder and i ' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people , when he shall stand for his place . He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i ' the body .
MENENIUS : One i ' the neck , and two i ' the thigh , --there 's nine that I know .
VOLUMNIA : He had , before this last expedition , twenty-five wounds upon him .
MENENIUS : Now it 's twenty-seven : every gash was an enemy 's grave . A shout and flourish Hark ! the trumpets .
VOLUMNIA : These are the ushers of Marcius : before him he carries noise , and behind him he leaves tears : Death , that dark spirit , in ' s nervy arm doth lie ; Which , being advanced , declines , and then men die . A sennet . Trumpets sound . Enter COMINIUS the general , and TITUS LARTIUS ; between them , CORIOLANUS , crowned with an oaken garland ; with Captains and Soldiers , and a Herald
Herald : Know , Rome , that all alone Marcius did fight Within Corioli gates : where he hath won , With fame , a name to Caius Marcius ; these In honour follows Coriolanus . Welcome to Rome , renowned Coriolanus ! Flourish
All : Welcome to Rome , renowned Coriolanus !
CORIOLANUS : No more of this ; it does offend my heart : Pray now , no more .
COMINIUS : Look , sir , your mother !
CORIOLANUS : O , You have , I know , petition 'd all the gods For my prosperity ! Kneels
VOLUMNIA : Nay , my good soldier , up ; My gentle Marcius , worthy Caius , and By deed-achieving honour newly named , -- What is it ? --Coriolanus must I call thee ? -- But O , thy wife !
CORIOLANUS : My gracious silence , hail ! Wouldst thou have laugh 'd had I come coffin 'd home , That weep 'st to see me triumph ? Ay , my dear , Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear , And mothers that lack sons .
MENENIUS : Now , the gods crown thee !
CORIOLANUS : And live you yet ? To VALERIA O my sweet lady , pardon .
VOLUMNIA : I know not where to turn : O , welcome home : And welcome , general : and ye 're welcome all .
