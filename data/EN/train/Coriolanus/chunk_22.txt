BRUTUS : Has said enough .
SICINIUS : Has spoken like a traitor , and shall answer As traitors do .
CORIOLANUS : Thou wretch , despite o 'erwhelm thee ! What should the people do with these bald tribunes ? On whom depending , their obedience fails To the greater bench : in a rebellion , When what 's not meet , but what must be , was law , Then were they chosen : in a better hour , Let what is meet be said it must be meet , And throw their power i ' the dust .
BRUTUS : Manifest treason !
SICINIUS : This a consul ? no .
BRUTUS : The aediles , ho ! Enter an AEdile Let him be apprehended .
SICINIUS : Go , call the people : Exit AEdile in whose name myself Attach thee as a traitorous innovator , A foe to the public weal : obey , I charge thee , And follow to thine answer .
CORIOLANUS : Hence , old goat ! Senators , & C We 'll surety him .
COMINIUS : Aged sir , hands off .
CORIOLANUS : Hence , rotten thing ! or I shall shake thy bones Out of thy garments .
SICINIUS : Help , ye citizens ! Enter a rabble of Citizens ( Plebeians ) , with the AEdiles
MENENIUS : On both sides more respect .
SICINIUS : Here 's he that would take from you all your power .
BRUTUS : Seize him , AEdiles !
Citizens : Down with him ! down with him ! Senators , & C Weapons , weapons , weapons ! They all bustle about CORIOLANUS , crying ' Tribunes ! ' ' Patricians ! ' ' Citizens ! ' ' What , ho ! ' ' Sicinius ! ' ' Brutus ! ' ' Coriolanus ! ' ' Citizens ! ' ' Peace , peace , peace ! ' ' Stay , hold , peace ! '
MENENIUS : What is about to be ? I am out of breath ; Confusion 's near ; I cannot speak . You , tribunes To the people ! Coriolanus , patience ! Speak , good Sicinius .
SICINIUS : Hear me , people ; peace !
Citizens : Let 's hear our tribune : peace Speak , speak , speak .
SICINIUS : You are at point to lose your liberties : Marcius would have all from you ; Marcius , Whom late you have named for consul .
MENENIUS : Fie , fie , fie ! This is the way to kindle , not to quench .
First Senator : To unbuild the city and to lay all flat .
SICINIUS : What is the city but the people ?
Citizens : True , The people are the city .
BRUTUS : By the consent of all , we were establish 'd The people 's magistrates .
Citizens : You so remain .
MENENIUS : And so are like to do .
COMINIUS : That is the way to lay the city flat ; To bring the roof to the foundation , And bury all , which yet distinctly ranges , In heaps and piles of ruin .
SICINIUS : This deserves death .
BRUTUS : Or let us stand to our authority , Or let us lose it . We do here pronounce , Upon the part o ' the people , in whose power We were elected theirs , Marcius is worthy Of present death .
SICINIUS : Therefore lay hold of him ; Bear him to the rock Tarpeian , and from thence Into destruction cast him .
BRUTUS : AEdiles , seize him !
Citizens : Yield , Marcius , yield !
MENENIUS : Hear me one word ; Beseech you , tribunes , hear me but a word .
AEdile : Peace , peace !
MENENIUS : Be that you seem , truly your country 's friend , And temperately proceed to what you would Thus violently redress .
BRUTUS : Sir , those cold ways , That seem like prudent helps , are very poisonous Where the disease is violent . Lay hands upon him , And bear him to the rock .
CORIOLANUS : No , I 'll die here . Drawing his sword There 's some among you have beheld me fighting : Come , try upon yourselves what you have seen me .
MENENIUS : Down with that sword ! Tribunes , withdraw awhile .
