VOLUMNIA : One on ' s father 's moods .
VALERIA : Indeed , la , ' tis a noble child .
VIRGILIA : A crack , madam .
VALERIA : Come , lay aside your stitchery ; I must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon .
VIRGILIA : No , good madam ; I will not out of doors .
VALERIA : Not out of doors !
VOLUMNIA : She shall , she shall .
VIRGILIA : Indeed , no , by your patience ; I 'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars .
VALERIA : Fie , you confine yourself most unreasonably : come , you must go visit the good lady that lies in .
VIRGILIA : I will wish her speedy strength , and visit her with my prayers ; but I cannot go thither .
VOLUMNIA : Why , I pray you ?
VIRGILIA : ' Tis not to save labour , nor that I want love .
VALERIA : You would be another Penelope : yet , they say , all the yarn she spun in Ulysses ' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths . Come ; I would your cambric were sensible as your finger , that you might leave pricking it for pity . Come , you shall go with us .
VIRGILIA : No , good madam , pardon me ; indeed , I will not forth .
VALERIA : In truth , la , go with me ; and I 'll tell you excellent news of your husband .
VIRGILIA : O , good madam , there can be none yet .
VALERIA : Verily , I do not jest with you ; there came news from him last night .
VIRGILIA : Indeed , madam ?
VALERIA : In earnest , it 's true ; I heard a senator speak it . Thus it is : the Volsces have an army forth ; against whom Cominius the general is gone , with one part of our Roman power : your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli ; they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars . This is true , on mine honour ; and so , I pray , go with us .
VIRGILIA : Give me excuse , good madam ; I will obey you in every thing hereafter .
VOLUMNIA : Let her alone , lady : as she is now , she will but disease our better mirth .
VALERIA : In troth , I think she would . Fare you well , then . Come , good sweet lady . Prithee , Virgilia , turn thy solemness out o ' door. and go along with us .
VIRGILIA : No , at a word , madam ; indeed , I must not . I wish you much mirth .
VALERIA : Well , then , farewell . Enter , with drum and colours , MARCIUS , TITUS LARTIUS , Captains and Soldiers . To them a Messenger
MARCIUS : Yonder comes news . A wager they have met .
LARTIUS : My horse to yours , no .
MARCIUS : ' Tis done .
LARTIUS : Agreed .
MARCIUS : Say , has our general met the enemy ?
Messenger : They lie in view ; but have not spoke as yet .
LARTIUS : So , the good horse is mine .
MARCIUS : I 'll buy him of you .
LARTIUS : No , I 'll nor sell nor give him : lend you him I will For half a hundred years . Summon the town .
MARCIUS : How far off lie these armies ?
Messenger : Within this mile and half .
MARCIUS : Then shall we hear their ' larum , and they ours . Now , Mars , I prithee , make us quick in work , That we with smoking swords may march from hence , To help our fielded friends ! Come , blow thy blast . They sound a parley . Enter two Senators with others on the walls Tutus Aufidius , is he within your walls ?
