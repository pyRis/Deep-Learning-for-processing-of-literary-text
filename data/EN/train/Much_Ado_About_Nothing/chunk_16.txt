CLAUDIO : That 's as much as to say , the sweet youth 's in love .
DON PEDRO : The greatest note of it is his melancholy .
CLAUDIO : And when was he wont to wash his face ?
DON PEDRO : Yea , or to paint himself ? for the which , I hear what they say of him .
CLAUDIO : Nay , but his jesting spirit ; which is now crept into a lute-string and now governed by stops .
DON PEDRO : Indeed , that tells a heavy tale for him : conclude , conclude he is in love .
CLAUDIO : Nay , but I know who loves him .
DON PEDRO : That would I know too : I warrant , one that knows him not .
CLAUDIO : Yes , and his ill conditions ; and , in despite of all , dies for him .
DON PEDRO : She shall be buried with her face upwards .
BENEDICK : Yet is this no charm for the toothache . Old signior , walk aside with me : I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you , which these hobby-horses must not hear .
DON PEDRO : For my life , to break with him about Beatrice .
CLAUDIO : ' Tis even so . Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice ; and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet . Enter DON JOHN
DON JOHN : My lord and brother , God save you !
DON PEDRO : Good den , brother .
DON JOHN : If your leisure served , I would speak with you .
DON PEDRO : In private ?
DON JOHN : If it please you : yet Count Claudio may hear ; for what I would speak of concerns him .
DON PEDRO : What 's the matter ?
DON JOHN : Means your lordship to be married to-morrow ?
DON PEDRO : You know he does .
DON JOHN : I know not that , when he knows what I know .
CLAUDIO : If there be any impediment , I pray you discover it .
DON JOHN : You may think I love you not : let that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that I now will manifest . For my brother , I think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage ; --surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed .
DON PEDRO : Why , what 's the matter ?
DON JOHN : I came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a talking of , the lady is disloyal .
CLAUDIO : Who , Hero ?
DON PEDRO : Even she ; Leonato 's Hero , your Hero , every man 's Hero :
CLAUDIO : Disloyal ?
DON JOHN : The word is too good to paint out her wickedness ; I could say she were worse : think you of a worse title , and I will fit her to it . Wonder not till further warrant : go but with me to-night , you shall see her chamber-window entered , even the night before her wedding-day : if you love her then , to-morrow wed her ; but it would better fit your honour to change your mind .
CLAUDIO : May this be so ?
DON PEDRO : I will not think it .
DON JOHN : If you dare not trust that you see , confess not that you know : if you will follow me , I will show you enough ; and when you have seen more and heard more , proceed accordingly .
CLAUDIO : If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry her to-morrow in the congregation , where I should wed , there will I shame her .
DON PEDRO : And , as I wooed for thee to obtain her , I will join with thee to disgrace her .
DON JOHN : I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses : bear it coldly but till midnight , and let the issue show itself .
DON PEDRO : O day untowardly turned !
CLAUDIO : O mischief strangely thwarting !
