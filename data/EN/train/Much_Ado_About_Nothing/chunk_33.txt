LEONATO : Call her forth , brother ; here 's the friar ready . Exit ANTONIO
DON PEDRO : Good morrow , Benedick . Why , what 's the matter , That you have such a February face , So full of frost , of storm and cloudiness ?
CLAUDIO : I think he thinks upon the savage bull . Tush , fear not , man ; we 'll tip thy horns with gold And all Europa shall rejoice at thee , As once Europa did at lusty Jove , When he would play the noble beast in love .
BENEDICK : Bull Jove , sir , had an amiable low ; And some such strange bull leap 'd your father 's cow , And got a calf in that same noble feat Much like to you , for you have just his bleat .
CLAUDIO : For this I owe you : here comes other reckonings . Re-enter ANTONIO , with the Ladies masked Which is the lady I must seize upon ?
ANTONIO : This same is she , and I do give you her .
CLAUDIO : Why , then she 's mine . Sweet , let me see your face .
LEONATO : No , that you shall not , till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her .
CLAUDIO : Give me your hand : before this holy friar , I am your husband , if you like of me .
HERO : And when I lived , I was your other wife : Unmasking And when you loved , you were my other husband .
CLAUDIO : Another Hero !
HERO : Nothing certainer : One Hero died defiled , but I do live , And surely as I live , I am a maid .
DON PEDRO : The former Hero ! Hero that is dead !
LEONATO : She died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
FRIAR FRANCIS : All this amazement can I qualify : When after that the holy rites are ended , I 'll tell you largely of fair Hero 's death : Meantime let wonder seem familiar , And to the chapel let us presently .
BENEDICK : Soft and fair , friar . Which is Beatrice ?
BEATRICE : I answer to that name . What is your will ?
BENEDICK : Do not you love me ?
BEATRICE : Why , no ; no more than reason .
BENEDICK : Why , then your uncle and the prince and Claudio Have been deceived ; they swore you did .
BEATRICE : Do not you love me ?
BENEDICK : Troth , no ; no more than reason .
BEATRICE : Why , then my cousin Margaret and Ursula Are much deceived ; for they did swear you did .
BENEDICK : They swore that you were almost sick for me .
BEATRICE : They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me .
BENEDICK : ' Tis no such matter . Then you do not love me ?
BEATRICE : No , truly , but in friendly recompense .
LEONATO : Come , cousin , I am sure you love the gentleman .
CLAUDIO : And I 'll be sworn upon 't that he loves her ; For here 's a paper written in his hand , A halting sonnet of his own pure brain , Fashion 'd to Beatrice .
HERO : And here 's another Writ in my cousin 's hand , stolen from her pocket , Containing her affection unto Benedick .
BENEDICK : A miracle ! here 's our own hands against our hearts . Come , I will have thee ; but , by this light , I take thee for pity .
BEATRICE : I would not deny you ; but , by this good day , I yield upon great persuasion ; and partly to save your life , for I was told you were in a consumption .
BENEDICK : Peace ! I will stop your mouth . Kissing her
DON PEDRO : How dost thou , Benedick , the married man ?
