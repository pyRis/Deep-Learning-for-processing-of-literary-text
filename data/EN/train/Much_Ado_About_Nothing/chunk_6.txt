LEONATO : Well , niece , I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband .
BEATRICE : Not till God make men of some other metal than earth . Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust ? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ? No , uncle , I 'll none : Adam 's sons are my brethren ; and , truly , I hold it a sin to match in my kindred .
LEONATO : Daughter , remember what I told you : if the prince do solicit you in that kind , you know your answer .
BEATRICE : The fault will be in the music , cousin , if you be not wooed in good time : if the prince be too important , tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer . For , hear me , Hero : wooing , wedding , and repenting , is as a Scotch jig , a measure , and a cinque pace : the first suit is hot and hasty , like a Scotch jig , and full as fantastical ; the wedding , mannerly-modest , as a measure , full of state and ancientry ; and then comes repentance and , with his bad legs , falls into the cinque pace faster and faster , till he sink into his grave .
LEONATO : Cousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly .
BEATRICE : I have a good eye , uncle ; I can see a church by daylight .
LEONATO : The revellers are entering , brother : make good room . All put on their masks Enter DON PEDRO , CLAUDIO , BENEDICK , BALTHASAR , DON JOHN , BORACHIO , MARGARET , URSULA and others , masked
DON PEDRO : Lady , will you walk about with your friend ?
HERO : So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing , I am yours for the walk ; and especially when I walk away .
DON PEDRO : With me in your company ?
HERO : I may say so , when I please .
DON PEDRO : And when please you to say so ?
HERO : When I like your favour ; for God defend the lute should be like the case !
DON PEDRO : My visor is Philemon 's roof ; within the house is Jove .
HERO : Why , then , your visor should be thatched .
DON PEDRO : Speak low , if you speak love . Drawing her aside
BALTHASAR : Well , I would you did like me .
MARGARET : So would not I , for your own sake ; for I have many ill-qualities .
BALTHASAR : Which is one ?
MARGARET : I say my prayers aloud .
BALTHASAR : I love you the better : the hearers may cry , Amen .
MARGARET : God match me with a good dancer !
BALTHASAR : Amen .
MARGARET : And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done ! Answer , clerk .
BALTHASAR : No more words : the clerk is answered .
URSULA : I know you well enough ; you are Signior Antonio .
ANTONIO : At a word , I am not .
URSULA : I know you by the waggling of your head .
ANTONIO : To tell you true , I counterfeit him .
URSULA : You could never do him so ill-well , unless you were the very man . Here 's his dry hand up and down : you are he , you are he .
ANTONIO : At a word , I am not .
URSULA : Come , come , do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit ? can virtue hide itself ? Go to , mum , you are he : graces will appear , and there 's an end .
BEATRICE : Will you not tell me who told you so ?
BENEDICK : No , you shall pardon me .
BEATRICE : Nor will you not tell me who you are ?
BENEDICK : Not now .
BEATRICE : That I was disdainful , and that I had my good wit out of the ' Hundred Merry Tales : ' --well this was Signior Benedick that said so .
BENEDICK : What 's he ?
