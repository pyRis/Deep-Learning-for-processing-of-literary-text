BEATRICE : Will you go hear this news , signior ?
BENEDICK : I will live in thy heart , die in thy lap , and be buried in thy eyes ; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle 's . Enter DON PEDRO , CLAUDIO , and three or four with tapers
CLAUDIO : Is this the monument of Leonato ?
Lord : It is , my lord .
CLAUDIO : Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies : Death , in guerdon of her wrongs , Gives her fame which never dies . So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame . Hang thou there upon the tomb , Praising her when I am dumb . Now , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn . SONG . Pardon , goddess of the night , Those that slew thy virgin knight ; For the which , with songs of woe , Round about her tomb they go . Midnight , assist our moan ; Help us to sigh and groan , Heavily , heavily : Graves , yawn and yield your dead , Till death be uttered , Heavily , heavily .
CLAUDIO : Now , unto thy bones good night ! Yearly will I do this rite .
DON PEDRO : Good morrow , masters ; put your torches out : The wolves have prey 'd ; and look , the gentle day , Before the wheels of Phoebus , round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey . Thanks to you all , and leave us : fare you well .
CLAUDIO : Good morrow , masters : each his several way .
DON PEDRO : Come , let us hence , and put on other weeds ; And then to Leonato 's we will go .
CLAUDIO : And Hymen now with luckier issue speed 's Than this for whom we render 'd up this woe . Enter LEONATO , ANTONIO , BENEDICK , BEATRICE , MARGARET , URSULA , FRIAR FRANCIS , and HERO
FRIAR FRANCIS : Did I not tell you she was innocent ?
LEONATO : So are the prince and Claudio , who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated : But Margaret was in some fault for this , Although against her will , as it appears In the true course of all the question .
ANTONIO : Well , I am glad that all things sort so well .
BENEDICK : And so am I , being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it .
LEONATO : Well , daughter , and you gentle-women all , Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , And when I send for you , come hither mask 'd . The prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me . You know your office , brother : You must be father to your brother 's daughter And give her to young Claudio .
ANTONIO : Which I will do with confirm 'd countenance .
BENEDICK : Friar , I must entreat your pains , I think .
FRIAR FRANCIS : To do what , signior ?
BENEDICK : To bind me , or undo me ; one of them . Signior Leonato , truth it is , good signior , Your niece regards me with an eye of favour .
LEONATO : That eye my daughter lent her : ' tis most true .
BENEDICK : And I do with an eye of love requite her .
LEONATO : The sight whereof I think you had from me , From Claudio and the prince : but what 's your will ?
BENEDICK : Your answer , sir , is enigmatical : But , for my will , my will is your good will May stand with ours , this day to be conjoin 'd In the state of honourable marriage : In which , good friar , I shall desire your help .
LEONATO : My heart is with your liking .
FRIAR FRANCIS : And my help . Here comes the prince and Claudio . Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO , and two or three others
DON PEDRO : Good morrow to this fair assembly .
LEONATO : Good morrow , prince ; good morrow , Claudio : We here attend you . Are you yet determined To-day to marry with my brother 's daughter ?
