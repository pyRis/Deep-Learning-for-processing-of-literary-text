BENEDICK : Signior Leonato , let the friar advise you : And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the prince and Claudio , Yet , by mine honour , I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body .
LEONATO : Being that I flow in grief , The smallest twine may lead me .
FRIAR FRANCIS : ' Tis well consented : presently away ; For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure . Come , lady , die to live : this wedding-day Perhaps is but prolong 'd : have patience and endure .
BENEDICK : Lady Beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
BEATRICE : Yea , and I will weep a while longer .
BENEDICK : I will not desire that .
BEATRICE : You have no reason ; I do it freely .
BENEDICK : Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
BEATRICE : Ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
BENEDICK : Is there any way to show such friendship ?
BEATRICE : A very even way , but no such friend .
BENEDICK : May a man do it ?
BEATRICE : It is a man 's office , but not yours .
BENEDICK : I do love nothing in the world so well as you : is not that strange ?
BEATRICE : As strange as the thing I know not . It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you : but believe me not ; and yet I lie not ; I confess nothing , nor I deny nothing . I am sorry for my cousin .
BENEDICK : By my sword , Beatrice , thou lovest me .
BEATRICE : Do not swear , and eat it .
BENEDICK : I will swear by it that you love me ; and I will make him eat it that says I love not you .
BEATRICE : Will you not eat your word ?
BENEDICK : With no sauce that can be devised to it . I protest I love thee .
BEATRICE : Why , then , God forgive me !
BENEDICK : What offence , sweet Beatrice ?
BEATRICE : You have stayed me in a happy hour : I was about to protest I loved you .
BENEDICK : And do it with all thy heart .
BEATRICE : I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
BENEDICK : Come , bid me do any thing for thee .
BEATRICE : Kill Claudio .
BENEDICK : Ha ! not for the wide world .
BEATRICE : You kill me to deny it . Farewell .
BENEDICK : Tarry , sweet Beatrice .
BEATRICE : I am gone , though I am here : there is no love in you : nay , I pray you , let me go .
BENEDICK : Beatrice , --
BEATRICE : In faith , I will go .
BENEDICK : We 'll be friends first .
BEATRICE : You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
BENEDICK : Is Claudio thine enemy ?
BEATRICE : Is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonoured my kinswoman ? O that I were a man ! What , bear her in hand until they come to take hands ; and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancour , --O God , that I were a man ! I would eat his heart in the market-place .
BENEDICK : Hear me , Beatrice , --
BEATRICE : Talk with a man out at a window ! A proper saying !
BENEDICK : Nay , but , Beatrice , --
BEATRICE : Sweet Hero ! She is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
BENEDICK : Beat--
