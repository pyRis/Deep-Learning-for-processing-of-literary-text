CLAUDIO : I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice , that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life , to make thee a double-dealer ; which , out of question , thou wilt be , if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee .
BENEDICK : Come , come , we are friends : let 's have a dance ere we are married , that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives ' heels .
LEONATO : We 'll have dancing afterward .
BENEDICK : First , of my word ; therefore play , music . Prince , thou art sad ; get thee a wife , get thee a wife : there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn . Enter a Messenger
Messenger : My lord , your brother John is ta 'en in flight , And brought with armed men back to Messina .
