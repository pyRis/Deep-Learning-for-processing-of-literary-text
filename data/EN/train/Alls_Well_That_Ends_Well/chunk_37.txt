KING : Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes ? Is 't real that I see ?
HELENA : No , my good lord ; ' Tis but the shadow of a wife you see , The name and not the thing .
BERTRAM : Both , both . O , pardon !
HELENA : O my good lord , when I was like this maid , I found you wondrous kind . There is your ring ; And , look you , here 's your letter ; this it says : ' When from my finger you can get this ring And are by me with child , ' & c . This is done : Will you be mine , now you are doubly won ?
BERTRAM : If she , my liege , can make me know this clearly , I 'll love her dearly , ever , ever dearly .
HELENA : If it appear not plain and prove untrue , Deadly divorce step between me and you ! O my dear mother , do I see you living ?
LAFEU : Mine eyes smell onions ; I shall weep anon : To PAROLLES Good Tom Drum , lend me a handkercher : so , I thank thee : wait on me home , I 'll make sport with thee : Let thy courtesies alone , they are scurvy ones .
KING : Let us from point to point this story know , To make the even truth in pleasure flow . To DIANA If thou be 'st yet a fresh uncropped flower , Choose thou thy husband , and I 'll pay thy dower ; For I can guess that by thy honest aid Thou keep 'st a wife herself , thyself a maid . Of that and all the progress , more or less , Resolvedly more leisure shall express : All yet seems well ; and if it end so meet , The bitter past , more welcome is the sweet . Flourish EPILOGUE
