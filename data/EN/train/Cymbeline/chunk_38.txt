CYMBELINE : I have surely seen him : His favour is familiar to me . Boy , Thou hast look 'd thyself into my grace , And art mine own . I know not why , wherefore , To say ' live , boy : ' ne 'er thank thy master ; live : And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt , Fitting my bounty and thy state , I 'll give it ; Yea , though thou do demand a prisoner , The noblest ta 'en .
IMOGEN : I humbly thank your highness .
CAIUS LUCIUS : I do not bid thee beg my life , good lad ; And yet I know thou wilt .
IMOGEN : No , no : alack , There 's other work in hand : I see a thing Bitter to me as death : your life , good master , Must shuffle for itself .
CAIUS LUCIUS : The boy disdains me , He leaves me , scorns me : briefly die their joys That place them on the truth of girls and boys . Why stands he so perplex 'd ?
CYMBELINE : What wouldst thou , boy ? I love thee more and more : think more and more What 's best to ask . Know 'st him thou look 'st on ? speak , Wilt have him live ? Is he thy kin ? thy friend ?
IMOGEN : He is a Roman ; no more kin to me Than I to your highness ; who , being born your vassal , Am something nearer .
CYMBELINE : Wherefore eyest him so ?
IMOGEN : I 'll tell you , sir , in private , if you please To give me hearing .
CYMBELINE : Ay , with all my heart , And lend my best attention . What 's thy name ?
IMOGEN : Fidele , sir .
CYMBELINE : Thou 'rt my good youth , my page ; I 'll be thy master : walk with me ; speak freely . CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart
BELARIUS : Is not this boy revived from death ?
ARVIRAGUS : One sand another Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad Who died , and was Fidele . What think you ?
GUIDERIUS : The same dead thing alive .
BELARIUS : Peace , peace ! see further ; he eyes us not ; forbear ; Creatures may be alike : were ' t he , I am sure He would have spoke to us .
GUIDERIUS : But we saw him dead .
BELARIUS : Be silent ; let 's see further .
PISANIO : It is my mistress : Since she is living , let the time run on To good or bad . CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward
CYMBELINE : Come , stand thou by our side ; Make thy demand aloud . To IACHIMO Sir , step you forth ; Give answer to this boy , and do it freely ; Or , by our greatness and the grace of it , Which is our honour , bitter torture shall Winnow the truth from falsehood . On , speak to him .
IMOGEN : My boon is , that this gentleman may render Of whom he had this ring .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : What 's that to him ?
CYMBELINE : That diamond upon your finger , say How came it yours ?
IACHIMO : Thou 'lt torture me to leave unspoken that Which , to be spoke , would torture thee .
CYMBELINE : How ! me ?
IACHIMO : I am glad to be constrain 'd to utter that Which torments me to conceal . By villany I got this ring : ' twas Leonatus ' jewel ; Whom thou didst banish ; and--which more may grieve thee , As it doth me--a nobler sir ne 'er lived ' Twixt sky and ground . Wilt thou hear more , my lord ?
CYMBELINE : All that belongs to this .
IACHIMO : That paragon , thy daughter , -- For whom my heart drops blood , and my false spirits Quail to remember--Give me leave ; I faint .
CYMBELINE : My daughter ! what of her ? Renew thy strength : I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will Than die ere I hear more : strive , man , and speak .
