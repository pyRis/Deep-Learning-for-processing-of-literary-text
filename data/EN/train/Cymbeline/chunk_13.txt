PISANIO : ' Twill not be lost .
IMOGEN : I hope so : go and search . Exit PISANIO
CLOTEN : You have abused me : ' His meanest garment ! '
IMOGEN : Ay , I said so , sir : If you will make 't an action , call witness to 't .
CLOTEN : I will inform your father .
IMOGEN : Your mother too : She 's my good lady , and will conceive , I hope , But the worst of me . So , I leave you , sir , To the worst of discontent . Exit
CLOTEN : I 'll be revenged : ' His meanest garment ! ' Well . Exit CYMBELINE Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : Fear it not , sir : I would I were so sure To win the king as I am bold her honour Will remain hers .
PHILARIO : What means do you make to him ?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : Not any , but abide the change of time , Quake in the present winter 's state and wish That warmer days would come : in these sear 'd hopes , I barely gratify your love ; they failing , I must die much your debtor .
PHILARIO : Your very goodness and your company O 'erpays all I can do . By this , your king Hath heard of great Augustus : Caius Lucius Will do 's commission throughly : and I think He 'll grant the tribute , send the arrearages , Or look upon our Romans , whose remembrance Is yet fresh in their grief .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : I do believe , Statist though I am none , nor like to be , That this will prove a war ; and you shall hear The legions now in Gallia sooner landed In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings Of any penny tribute paid . Our countrymen Are men more order 'd than when Julius Caesar Smiled at their lack of skill , but found their courage Worthy his frowning at : their discipline , Now mingled with their courages , will make known To their approvers they are people such That mend upon the world . Enter IACHIMO
PHILARIO : See ! Iachimo !
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : The swiftest harts have posted you by land ; And winds of all the comers kiss 'd your sails , To make your vessel nimble .
PHILARIO : Welcome , sir .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : I hope the briefness of your answer made The speediness of your return .
IACHIMO : Your lady Is one of the fairest that I have look 'd upon .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : And therewithal the best ; or let her beauty Look through a casement to allure false hearts And be false with them .
IACHIMO : Here are letters for you .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : Their tenor good , I trust .
IACHIMO : ' Tis very like .
PHILARIO : Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court When you were there ?
IACHIMO : He was expected then , But not approach 'd .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : All is well yet . Sparkles this stone as it was wont ? or is 't not Too dull for your good wearing ?
IACHIMO : If I had lost it , I should have lost the worth of it in gold . I 'll make a journey twice as far , to enjoy A second night of such sweet shortness which Was mine in Britain , for the ring is won .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : The stone 's too hard to come by .
IACHIMO : Not a whit , Your lady being so easy .
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : Make not , sir , Your loss your sport : I hope you know that we Must not continue friends .
IACHIMO : Good sir , we must , If you keep covenant . Had I not brought The knowledge of your mistress home , I grant We were to question further : but I now Profess myself the winner of her honour , Together with your ring ; and not the wronger Of her or you , having proceeded but By both your wills .
