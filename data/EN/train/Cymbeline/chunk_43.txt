CYMBELINE : This hath some seeming .
Soothsayer : The lofty cedar , royal Cymbeline , Personates thee : and thy lopp 'd branches point Thy two sons forth ; who , by Belarius stol 'n , For many years thought dead , are now revived , To the majestic cedar join 'd , whose issue Promises Britain peace and plenty .
CYMBELINE : Well My peace we will begin . And , Caius Lucius , Although the victor , we submit to Caesar , And to the Roman empire ; promising To pay our wonted tribute , from the which We were dissuaded by our wicked queen ; Whom heavens , in justice , both on her and hers , Have laid most heavy hand .
Soothsayer : The fingers of the powers above do tune The harmony of this peace . The vision Which I made known to Lucius , ere the stroke Of this yet scarce-cold battle , at this instant Is full accomplish 'd ; for the Roman eagle , From south to west on wing soaring aloft , Lessen 'd herself , and in the beams o ' the sun So vanish 'd : which foreshow 'd our princely eagle , The imperial Caesar , should again unite His favour with the radiant Cymbeline , Which shines here in the west .
