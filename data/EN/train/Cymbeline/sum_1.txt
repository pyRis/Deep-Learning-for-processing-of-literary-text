Cymbeline is the King of Britain. He marries an unpleasant woman who has an arrogant son called Cloten. Cymbeline arranges the marriage of his beautiful daughter, Imogen, to Cloten but she defies him and marries the poor but worthy Posthumus Leonatus in secret.  Cymbeline banishes Posthumus, who goes to Rome. Imogen gives him a diamond ring and he gives her a bracelet.  Several plot lines follow, involving disguises, mistaken identity, deceit, treachery, and poison. The villain of the play is Iachimo, who bets a large sum of money against Posthumus' ring that he can seduce Imogen when he goes to Britain. Arriving there, he realises that she cannot be seduced, but, he hides in her bedroom, spies on her, and on the basis of what he sees, manufactures â€˜evidence' that convinces Posthumus that he has won the wager.  Posthumus commissions his servant Pisanio to kill Innogen at Milford Haven, but instead, Pisanio helps her to disguise herself as Fidele, a page, and she goes to Wales. Cloten pursues her to Wales disguised as Posthumus. He is determined to rape her and kill Posthumus. Instead, he is killed by one of her brothers, and his body is laid beside Imogen, who has taken a potion that makes her appear to be dead.  Posthumus wages war against the Romans and defeats them. Iachimo confesses to his misdemeanors, the characters reveal themselves, all the misunderstandings are resolved and the lovers are reunited.
