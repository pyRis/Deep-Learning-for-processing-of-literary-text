ARVIRAGUS : Brother , farewell .
IMOGEN : I wish ye sport .
ARVIRAGUS : You health . So please you , sir .
IMOGEN : These are kind creatures . Gods , what lies I have heard ! Our courtiers say all 's savage but at court : Experience , O , thou disprovest report ! The imperious seas breed monsters , for the dish Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish . I am sick still ; heart-sick . Pisanio , I 'll now taste of thy drug . Swallows some
GUIDERIUS : I could not stir him : He said he was gentle , but unfortunate ; Dishonestly afflicted , but yet honest .
ARVIRAGUS : Thus did he answer me : yet said , hereafter I might know more .
BELARIUS : To the field , to the field ! We 'll leave you for this time : go in and rest .
ARVIRAGUS : We 'll not be long away .
BELARIUS : Pray , be not sick , For you must be our housewife .
IMOGEN : Well or ill , I am bound to you .
BELARIUS : And shalt be ever . Exit IMOGEN , to the cave This youth , how 'er distress 'd , appears he hath had Good ancestors .
ARVIRAGUS : How angel-like he sings !
GUIDERIUS : But his neat cookery ! he cut our roots In characters , And sauced our broths , as Juno had been sick And he her dieter .
ARVIRAGUS : Nobly he yokes A smiling with a sigh , as if the sigh Was that it was , for not being such a smile ; The smile mocking the sigh , that it would fly From so divine a temple , to commix With winds that sailors rail at .
GUIDERIUS : I do note That grief and patience , rooted in him both , Mingle their spurs together .
ARVIRAGUS : Grow , patience ! And let the stinking elder , grief , untwine His perishing root with the increasing vine !
BELARIUS : It is great morning . Come , away ! -- Who 's there ? Enter CLOTEN
CLOTEN : I cannot find those runagates ; that villain Hath mock 'd me . I am faint .
BELARIUS : ' Those runagates ! ' Means he not us ? I partly know him : ' tis Cloten , the son o ' the queen . I fear some ambush . I saw him not these many years , and yet I know ' tis he . We are held as outlaws : hence !
GUIDERIUS : He is but one : you and my brother search What companies are near : pray you , away ; Let me alone with him .
CLOTEN : Soft ! What are you That fly me thus ? some villain mountaineers ? I have heard of such . What slave art thou ?
GUIDERIUS : A thing More slavish did I ne 'er than answering A slave without a knock .
CLOTEN : Thou art a robber , A law-breaker , a villain : yield thee , thief .
GUIDERIUS : To who ? to thee ? What art thou ? Have not I An arm as big as thine ? a heart as big ? Thy words , I grant , are bigger , for I wear not My dagger in my mouth . Say what thou art , Why I should yield to thee ?
CLOTEN : Thou villain base , Know 'st me not by my clothes ?
GUIDERIUS : No , nor thy tailor , rascal , Who is thy grandfather : he made those clothes , Which , as it seems , make thee .
CLOTEN : Thou precious varlet , My tailor made them not .
GUIDERIUS : Hence , then , and thank The man that gave them thee . Thou art some fool ; I am loath to beat thee .
CLOTEN : Thou injurious thief , Hear but my name , and tremble .
GUIDERIUS : What 's thy name ?
CLOTEN : Cloten , thou villain .
GUIDERIUS : Cloten , thou double villain , be thy name , I cannot tremble at it : were it Toad , or Adder , Spider , ' Twould move me sooner .
CLOTEN : To thy further fear , Nay , to thy mere confusion , thou shalt know I am son to the queen .
