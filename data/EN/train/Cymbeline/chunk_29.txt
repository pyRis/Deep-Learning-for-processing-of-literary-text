GUIDERIUS : Cadwal , I cannot sing : I 'll weep , and word it with thee ; For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse Than priests and fanes that lie .
ARVIRAGUS : We 'll speak it , then .
BELARIUS : Great griefs , I see , medicine the less ; for Cloten Is quite forgot . He was a queen 's son , boys ; And though he came our enemy , remember He was paid for that : though mean and mighty , rotting Together , have one dust , yet reverence , That angel of the world , doth make distinction Of place ' tween high and low . Our foe was princely And though you took his life , as being our foe , Yet bury him as a prince .
GUIDERIUS : Pray You , fetch him hither . Thersites ' body is as good as Ajax ' , When neither are alive .
ARVIRAGUS : If you 'll go fetch him , We 'll say our song the whilst . Brother , begin . Exit BELARIUS
GUIDERIUS : Nay , Cadwal , we must lay his head to the east ; My father hath a reason for 't .
ARVIRAGUS : ' Tis true .
GUIDERIUS : Come on then , and remove him .
ARVIRAGUS : So . Begin . SONG
GUIDERIUS : Fear no more the heat o ' the sun , Nor the furious winter 's rages ; Thou thy worldly task hast done , Home art gone , and ta 'en thy wages : Golden lads and girls all must , As chimney-sweepers , come to dust .
ARVIRAGUS : Fear no more the frown o ' the great ; Thou art past the tyrant 's stroke ; Care no more to clothe and eat ; To thee the reed is as the oak : The sceptre , learning , physic , must All follow this , and come to dust .
GUIDERIUS : Fear no more the lightning flash ,
ARVIRAGUS : Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone ;
GUIDERIUS : Fear not slander , censure rash ;
ARVIRAGUS : Thou hast finish 'd joy and moan :
GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS : All lovers young , all lovers must Consign to thee , and come to dust .
GUIDERIUS : No exorciser harm thee !
ARVIRAGUS : Nor no witchcraft charm thee !
GUIDERIUS : Ghost unlaid forbear thee !
ARVIRAGUS : Nothing ill come near thee !
GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS : Quiet consummation have ; And renowned be thy grave ! Re-enter BELARIUS , with the body of CLOTEN
GUIDERIUS : We have done our obsequies : come , lay him down .
BELARIUS : Here 's a few flowers ; but ' bout midnight , more : The herbs that have on them cold dew o ' the night Are strewings fitt 'st for graves . Upon their faces . You were as flowers , now wither 'd : even so These herblets shall , which we upon you strew . Come on , away : apart upon our knees . The ground that gave them first has them again : Their pleasures here are past , so is their pain .
