MALCOLM : I would the friends we miss were safe arrived .
SIWARD : Some must go off : and yet , by these I see , So great a day as this is cheaply bought .
MALCOLM : Macduff is missing , and your noble son .
ROSS : Your son , my lord , has paid a soldier 's debt : He only lived but till he was a man ; The which no sooner had his prowess confirm 'd In the unshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he died .
SIWARD : Then he is dead ?
ROSS : Ay , and brought off the field : your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth , for then It hath no end .
SIWARD : Had he his hurts before ?
ROSS : Ay , on the front .
SIWARD : Why then , God 's soldier be he ! Had I as many sons as I have hairs , I would not wish them to a fairer death : And so , his knell is knoll 'd .
MALCOLM : He 's worth more sorrow , And that I 'll spend for him .
SIWARD : He 's worth no more They say he parted well , and paid his score : And so , God be with him ! Here comes newer comfort . Re-enter MACDUFF , with MACBETH 's head
MACDUFF : Hail , king ! for so thou art : behold , where stands The usurper 's cursed head : the time is free : I see thee compass 'd with thy kingdom 's pearl , That speak my salutation in their minds ; Whose voices I desire aloud with mine : Hail , King of Scotland !
ALL : Hail , King of Scotland ! Flourish
