LEONTES :
Nor night nor day no rest : it is but weakness :
To bear the matter thus ; mere weakness . If :
The cause were not in being , --part o ' the cause , :
She the adulteress ; for the harlot king :
Is quite beyond mine arm , out of the blank :
And level of my brain , plot-proof ; but she :
I can hook to me : say that she were gone , :
Given to the fire , a moiety of my rest :
Might come to me again . Who 's there ? :
First Servant :
My lord ? :
LEONTES :
How does the boy ? :
First Servant :
He took good rest to-night ; :
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged . :
LEONTES :
To see his nobleness ! :
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother , :
He straight declined , droop 'd , took it deeply , :
Fasten 'd and fix 'd the shame on 't in himself , :
Threw off his spirit , his appetite , his sleep , :
And downright languish 'd . Leave me solely : go , :
See how he fares . :
Exit Servant :
Fie , fie ! no thought of him : :
The thought of my revenges that way :
Recoil upon me : in himself too mighty , :
And in his parties , his alliance ; let him be :
Until a time may serve : for present vengeance , :
Take it on her . Camillo and Polixenes :
Laugh at me , make their pastime at my sorrow : :
They should not laugh if I could reach them , nor :
Shall she within my power . :
First Lord :
You must not enter . :
PAULINA :
Nay , rather , good my lords , be second to me : :
Fear you his tyrannous passion more , alas , :
Than the queen 's life ? a gracious innocent soul , :
More free than he is jealous . :
ANTIGONUS :
That 's enough . :
Second Servant :
Madam , he hath not slept tonight ; commanded :
None should come at him . :
PAULINA :
Not so hot , good sir : :
I come to bring him sleep . ' Tis such as you , :
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh :
At each his needless heavings , such as you :
Nourish the cause of his awaking : I :
Do come with words as medicinal as true , :
Honest as either , to purge him of that humour :
That presses him from sleep . :
LEONTES :
What noise there , ho ? :
PAULINA :
No noise , my lord ; but needful conference :
About some gossips for your highness . :
LEONTES :
How ! :
Away with that audacious lady ! Antigonus , :
I charged thee that she should not come about me : :
I knew she would . :
ANTIGONUS :
I told her so , my lord , :
On your displeasure 's peril and on mine , :
She should not visit you . :
LEONTES :
What , canst not rule her ? :
PAULINA :
From all dishonesty he can : in this , :
Unless he take the course that you have done , :
Commit me for committing honour , trust it , :
He shall not rule me . :
ANTIGONUS :
La you now , you hear : :
When she will take the rein I let her run ; :
But she 'll not stumble . :
PAULINA :
Good my liege , I come ; :
And , I beseech you , hear me , who profess :
Myself your loyal servant , your physician , :
Your most obedient counsellor , yet that dare :
Less appear so in comforting your evils , :
Than such as most seem yours : I say , I come :
From your good queen . :
LEONTES :
Good queen ! :
PAULINA :
Good queen , my lord , :
Good queen ; I say good queen ; :
And would by combat make her good , so were I :
A man , the worst about you . :
LEONTES :
Force her hence . :
PAULINA :
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes :
