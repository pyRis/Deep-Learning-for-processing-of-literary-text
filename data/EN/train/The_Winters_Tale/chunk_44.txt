Even with such life of majesty , warm life , :
As now it coldly stands , when first I woo 'd her ! :
I am ashamed : does not the stone rebuke me :
For being more stone than it ? O royal piece , :
There 's magic in thy majesty , which has :
My evils conjured to remembrance and :
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits , :
Standing like stone with thee . :
PERDITA :
And give me leave , :
And do not say ' tis superstition , that :
I kneel and then implore her blessing . Lady , :
Dear queen , that ended when I but began , :
Give me that hand of yours to kiss . :
PAULINA :
O , patience ! :
The statue is but newly fix 'd , the colour 's Not dry . :
CAMILLO :
My lord , your sorrow was too sore laid on , :
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away , :
So many summers dry ; scarce any joy :
Did ever so long live ; no sorrow :
But kill 'd itself much sooner . :
POLIXENES :
Dear my brother , :
Let him that was the cause of this have power :
To take off so much grief from you as he :
Will piece up in himself . :
PAULINA :
Indeed , my lord , :
If I had thought the sight of my poor image :
Would thus have wrought you , --for the stone is mine-- :
I 'ld not have show 'd it . :
LEONTES :
Do not draw the curtain . :
PAULINA :
No longer shall you gaze on 't , lest your fancy :
May think anon it moves . :
LEONTES :
Let be , let be . :
Would I were dead , but that , methinks , already-- :
What was he that did make it ? See , my lord , :
Would you not deem it breathed ? and that those veins :
Did verily bear blood ? :
POLIXENES :
Masterly done : :
The very life seems warm upon her lip . :
LEONTES :
The fixture of her eye has motion in 't , :
As we are mock 'd with art . :
PAULINA :
I 'll draw the curtain : :
My lord 's almost so far transported that :
He 'll think anon it lives . :
LEONTES :
O sweet Paulina , :
Make me to think so twenty years together ! :
No settled senses of the world can match :
The pleasure of that madness . Let ' t alone . :
PAULINA :
I am sorry , sir , I have thus far stirr 'd you : but :
I could afflict you farther . :
LEONTES :
Do , Paulina ; :
For this affliction has a taste as sweet :
As any cordial comfort . Still , methinks , :
There is an air comes from her : what fine chisel :
Could ever yet cut breath ? Let no man mock me , :
For I will kiss her . :
PAULINA :
Good my lord , forbear : :
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet ; :
You 'll mar it if you kiss it , stain your own :
With oily painting . Shall I draw the curtain ? :
LEONTES :
No , not these twenty years . :
PERDITA :
So long could I :
Stand by , a looker on . :
PAULINA :
Either forbear , :
Quit presently the chapel , or resolve you :
For more amazement . If you can behold it , :
I 'll make the statue move indeed , descend :
And take you by the hand ; but then you 'll think-- :
Which I protest against--I am assisted :
By wicked powers . :
LEONTES :
What you can make her do , :
I am content to look on : what to speak , :
I am content to hear ; for ' tis as easy :
To make her speak as move . :
PAULINA :
It is required :
You do awake your faith . Then all stand still ; :
On : those that think it is unlawful business :
I am about , let them depart . :
LEONTES :
Proceed : :
No foot shall stir . :
PAULINA :
