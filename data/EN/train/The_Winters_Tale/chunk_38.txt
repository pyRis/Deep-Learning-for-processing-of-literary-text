I know , in honour , O , that ever I :
Had squared me to thy counsel ! then , even now , :
I might have look 'd upon my queen 's full eyes , :
Have taken treasure from her lips-- :
PAULINA :
And left them :
More rich for what they yielded . :
LEONTES :
Thou speak 'st truth . :
No more such wives ; therefore , no wife : one worse , :
And better used , would make her sainted spirit :
Again possess her corpse , and on this stage , :
Where we 're offenders now , appear soul-vex 'd , :
And begin , ' Why to me ? ' :
PAULINA :
Had she such power , :
She had just cause . :
LEONTES :
She had ; and would incense me :
To murder her I married . :
PAULINA :
I should so . :
Were I the ghost that walk 'd , I 'ld bid you mark :
Her eye , and tell me for what dull part in 't :
You chose her ; then I 'ld shriek , that even your ears :
Should rift to hear me ; and the words that follow 'd :
Should be ' Remember mine . ' :
LEONTES :
Stars , stars , :
And all eyes else dead coals ! Fear thou no wife ; :
I 'll have no wife , Paulina . :
PAULINA :
Will you swear :
Never to marry but by my free leave ? :
LEONTES :
Never , Paulina ; so be blest my spirit ! :
PAULINA :
Then , good my lords , bear witness to his oath . :
CLEOMENES :
You tempt him over-much . :
PAULINA :
Unless another , :
As like Hermione as is her picture , :
Affront his eye . :
CLEOMENES :
Good madam , -- :
PAULINA :
I have done . :
Yet , if my lord will marry , --if you will , sir , :
No remedy , but you will , --give me the office :
To choose you a queen : she shall not be so young :
As was your former ; but she shall be such :
As , walk 'd your first queen 's ghost , :
it should take joy :
To see her in your arms . :
LEONTES :
My true Paulina , :
We shall not marry till thou bid 'st us . :
PAULINA :
That :
Shall be when your first queen 's again in breath ; :
Never till then . :
Gentleman :
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel , :
Son of Polixenes , with his princess , she :
The fairest I have yet beheld , desires access :
To your high presence . :
LEONTES :
What with him ? he comes not :
Like to his father 's greatness : his approach , :
So out of circumstance and sudden , tells us :
'Tis not a visitation framed , but forced :
By need and accident . What train ? :
Gentleman :
But few , :
And those but mean . :
LEONTES :
His princess , say you , with him ? :
Gentleman :
Ay , the most peerless piece of earth , I think , :
That e 'er the sun shone bright on . :
PAULINA :
O Hermione , :
As every present time doth boast itself :
Above a better gone , so must thy grave :
Give way to what 's seen now ! Sir , you yourself :
Have said and writ so , but your writing now :
Is colder than that theme , ' She had not been , :
Nor was not to be equall 'd ; ' --thus your verse :
Flow 'd with her beauty once : ' tis shrewdly ebb 'd , :
To say you have seen a better . :
Gentleman :
Pardon , madam : :
The one I have almost forgot , --your pardon , -- :
The other , when she has obtain 'd your eye , :
Will have your tongue too . This is a creature , :
Would she begin a sect , might quench the zeal :
Of all professors else , make proselytes :
Of who she but bid follow . :
PAULINA :
How ! not women ? :
Gentleman :
