I lodge my wife ; I 'll go in couples with her ; :
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her ; :
For every inch of woman in the world , :
Ay , every dram of woman 's flesh is false , If she be . :
LEONTES :
Hold your peaces . :
First Lord :
Good my lord , -- :
ANTIGONUS :
It is for you we speak , not for ourselves : :
You are abused and by some putter-on :
That will be damn 'd for 't ; would I knew the villain , :
I would land-damn him . Be she honour-flaw 'd , :
I have three daughters ; the eldest is eleven :
The second and the third , nine , and some five ; :
If this prove true , they 'll pay for 't : :
by mine honour , :
I 'll geld ' em all ; fourteen they shall not see , :
To bring false generations : they are co-heirs ; :
And I had rather glib myself than they :
Should not produce fair issue . :
LEONTES :
Cease ; no more . :
You smell this business with a sense as cold :
As is a dead man 's nose : but I do see 't and feel 't :
As you feel doing thus ; and see withal :
The instruments that feel . :
ANTIGONUS :
If it be so , :
We need no grave to bury honesty : :
There 's not a grain of it the face to sweeten :
Of the whole dungy earth . :
LEONTES :
What ! lack I credit ? :
First Lord :
I had rather you did lack than I , my lord , :
Upon this ground ; and more it would content me :
To have her honour true than your suspicion , :
Be blamed for 't how you might . :
LEONTES :
Why , what need we :
Commune with you of this , but rather follow :
Our forceful instigation ? Our prerogative :
Calls not your counsels , but our natural goodness :
Imparts this ; which if you , or stupefied :
Or seeming so in skill , cannot or will not :
Relish a truth like us , inform yourselves :
We need no more of your advice : the matter , :
The loss , the gain , the ordering on 't , is all :
Properly ours . :
ANTIGONUS :
And I wish , my liege , :
You had only in your silent judgment tried it , :
Without more overture . :
LEONTES :
How could that be ? :
Either thou art most ignorant by age , :
Or thou wert born a fool . Camillo 's flight , :
Added to their familiarity , :
Which was as gross as ever touch 'd conjecture , :
That lack 'd sight only , nought for approbation :
But only seeing , all other circumstances :
Made up to the deed , doth push on this proceeding : :
Yet , for a greater confirmation , :
For in an act of this importance ' twere :
Most piteous to be wild , I have dispatch 'd in post :
To sacred Delphos , to Apollo 's temple , :
Cleomenes and Dion , whom you know :
Of stuff 'd sufficiency : now from the oracle :
They will bring all ; whose spiritual counsel had , :
Shall stop or spur me . Have I done well ? :
First Lord :
Well done , my lord . :
LEONTES :
Though I am satisfied and need no more :
Than what I know , yet shall the oracle :
Give rest to the minds of others , such as he :
Whose ignorant credulity will not :
Come up to the truth . So have we thought it good :
From our free person she should be confined , :
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence :
Be left her to perform . Come , follow us ; :
We are to speak in public ; for this business :
Will raise us all . :
ANTIGONUS :
[ Aside ] :
To laughter , as I take it , :
If the good truth were known . :
