yields pound and odd shilling ; fifteen hundred :
shorn. what comes the wool to ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
[ Aside ] :
If the springe hold , the cock 's mine . :
Clown :
I cannot do 't without counters . Let me see ; what am :
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast ? Three pound :
of sugar , five pound of currants , rice , --what will :
this sister of mine do with rice ? But my father :
hath made her mistress of the feast , and she lays it :
on . She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for :
the shearers , three-man-song-men all , and very good :
ones ; but they are most of them means and bases ; but :
one puritan amongst them , and he sings psalms to :
horn-pipes . I must have saffron to colour the warden :
pies ; mace ; dates ? --none , that 's out of my note ; :
nutmegs , seven ; a race or two of ginger , but that I :
may beg ; four pound of prunes , and as many of :
raisins o ' the sun . :
AUTOLYCUS :
O that ever I was born ! :
Grovelling on the ground :
Clown :
I ' the name of me-- :
AUTOLYCUS :
O , help me , help me ! pluck but off these rags ; and :
then , death , death ! :
Clown :
Alack , poor soul ! thou hast need of more rags to lay :
on thee , rather than have these off . :
AUTOLYCUS :
O sir , the loathsomeness of them offends me more :
than the stripes I have received , which are mighty :
ones and millions . :
Clown :
Alas , poor man ! a million of beating may come to a :
great matter . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I am robbed , sir , and beaten ; my money and apparel :
ta 'en from me , and these detestable things put upon :
me . :
Clown :
What , by a horseman , or a footman ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
A footman , sweet sir , a footman . :
Clown :
Indeed , he should be a footman by the garments he :
has left with thee : if this be a horseman 's coat , :
it hath seen very hot service . Lend me thy hand , :
I 'll help thee : come , lend me thy hand . :
AUTOLYCUS :
O , good sir , tenderly , O ! :
Clown :
Alas , poor soul ! :
AUTOLYCUS :
O , good sir , softly , good sir ! I fear , sir , my :
shoulder-blade is out . :
Clown :
How now ! canst stand ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
[ Picking his pocket ] :
Softly , dear sir ; good sir , softly . You ha ' done me :
a charitable office . :
Clown :
Dost lack any money ? I have a little money for thee . :
AUTOLYCUS :
No , good sweet sir ; no , I beseech you , sir : I have :
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence , :
unto whom I was going ; I shall there have money , or :
any thing I want : offer me no money , I pray you ; :
that kills my heart . :
Clown :
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
A fellow , sir , that I have known to go about with :
troll-my-dames ; I knew him once a servant of the :
prince : I cannot tell , good sir , for which of his :
virtues it was , but he was certainly whipped out of the court . :
Clown :
His vices , you would say ; there 's no virtue whipped :
out of the court : they cherish it to make it stay :
there ; and yet it will no more but abide . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Vices , I would say , sir . I know this man well : he :
hath been since an ape-bearer ; then a :
process-server , a bailiff ; then he compassed a :
motion of the Prodigal Son , and married a tinker 's :
