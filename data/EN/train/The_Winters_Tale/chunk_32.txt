With her whom here I cannot hold on shore ; :
And most opportune to our need I have :
A vessel rides fast by , but not prepared :
For this design . What course I mean to hold :
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge , nor :
Concern me the reporting . :
CAMILLO :
O my lord ! :
I would your spirit were easier for advice , :
Or stronger for your need . :
FLORIZEL :
Hark , Perdita :
Drawing her aside :
I 'll hear you by and by . :
CAMILLO :
He 's irremoveable , :
Resolved for flight . Now were I happy , if :
His going I could frame to serve my turn , :
Save him from danger , do him love and honour , :
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia :
And that unhappy king , my master , whom :
I so much thirst to see . :
FLORIZEL :
Now , good Camillo ; :
I am so fraught with curious business that :
I leave out ceremony . :
CAMILLO :
Sir , I think :
You have heard of my poor services , i ' the love :
That I have borne your father ? :
FLORIZEL :
Very nobly :
Have you deserved : it is my father 's music :
To speak your deeds , not little of his care :
To have them recompensed as thought on . :
CAMILLO :
Well , my lord , :
If you may please to think I love the king :
And through him what is nearest to him , which is :
Your gracious self , embrace but my direction : :
If your more ponderous and settled project :
May suffer alteration , on mine honour , :
I 'll point you where you shall have such receiving :
As shall become your highness ; where you may :
Enjoy your mistress , from the whom , I see , :
There 's no disjunction to be made , but by-- :
As heavens forefend ! --your ruin ; marry her , :
And , with my best endeavours in your absence , :
Your discontenting father strive to qualify :
And bring him up to liking . :
FLORIZEL :
How , Camillo , :
May this , almost a miracle , be done ? :
That I may call thee something more than man :
And after that trust to thee . :
CAMILLO :
Have you thought on :
A place whereto you 'll go ? :
FLORIZEL :
Not any yet : :
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty :
To what we wildly do , so we profess :
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies :
Of every wind that blows . :
CAMILLO :
Then list to me : :
This follows , if you will not change your purpose :
But undergo this flight , make for Sicilia , :
And there present yourself and your fair princess , :
For so I see she must be , ' fore Leontes : :
She shall be habited as it becomes :
The partner of your bed . Methinks I see :
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping :
His welcomes forth ; asks thee the son forgiveness , :
As ' twere i ' the father 's person ; kisses the hands :
Of your fresh princess ; o 'er and o 'er divides him :
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness ; the one :
He chides to hell and bids the other grow :
Faster than thought or time . :
FLORIZEL :
Worthy Camillo , :
What colour for my visitation shall I :
Hold up before him ? :
CAMILLO :
Sent by the king your father :
To greet him and to give him comforts . Sir , :
The manner of your bearing towards him , with :
What you as from your father shall deliver , :
Things known betwixt us three , I 'll write you down : :
The which shall point you forth at every sitting :
What you must say ; that he shall not perceive :
But that you have your father 's bosom there :
And speak his very heart . :
FLORIZEL :
I am bound to you : :
There is some sap in this . :
CAMILLO :
A cause more promising :
