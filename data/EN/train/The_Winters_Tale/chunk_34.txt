not , man ; here 's no harm intended to thee . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I am a poor fellow , sir . :
CAMILLO :
Why , be so still ; here 's nobody will steal that from :
thee : yet for the outside of thy poverty we must :
make an exchange ; therefore discase thee instantly , :
--thou must think there 's a necessity in 't , --and :
change garments with this gentleman : though the :
pennyworth on his side be the worst , yet hold thee , :
there 's some boot . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I am a poor fellow , sir . :
Aside :
I know ye well enough . :
CAMILLO :
Nay , prithee , dispatch : the gentleman is half :
flayed already . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Are you in earnest , sir ? :
Aside :
I smell the trick on 't . :
FLORIZEL :
Dispatch , I prithee . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Indeed , I have had earnest : but I cannot with :
conscience take it . :
CAMILLO :
Unbuckle , unbuckle . :
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments :
Fortunate mistress , --let my prophecy :
Come home to ye ! --you must retire yourself :
Into some covert : take your sweetheart 's hat :
And pluck it o 'er your brows , muffle your face , :
Dismantle you , and , as you can , disliken :
The truth of your own seeming ; that you may-- :
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard :
Get undescried . :
PERDITA :
I see the play so lies :
That I must bear a part . :
CAMILLO :
No remedy . :
Have you done there ? :
FLORIZEL :
Should I now meet my father , :
He would not call me son . :
CAMILLO :
Nay , you shall have no hat . :
Giving it to PERDITA :
Come , lady , come . Farewell , my friend . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Adieu , sir . :
FLORIZEL :
O Perdita , what have we twain forgot ! :
Pray you , a word . :
CAMILLO :
[ Aside ] What I do next , shall be to tell the king :
Of this escape and whither they are bound ; :
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail :
To force him after : in whose company :
I shall review Sicilia , for whose sight :
I have a woman 's longing . :
FLORIZEL :
Fortune speed us ! :
Thus we set on , Camillo , to the sea-side . :
CAMILLO :
The swifter speed the better . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I understand the business , I hear it : to have an :
open ear , a quick eye , and a nimble hand , is :
necessary for a cut-purse ; a good nose is requisite :
also , to smell out work for the other senses . I see :
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive . :
What an exchange had this been without boot ! What :
a boot is here with this exchange ! Sure the gods do :
this year connive at us , and we may do any thing :
extempore . The prince himself is about a piece of :
iniquity , stealing away from his father with his :
clog at his heels : if I thought it were a piece of :
honesty to acquaint the king withal , I would not :
do 't : I hold it the more knavery to conceal it ; :
and therein am I constant to my profession . :
Re-enter Clown and Shepherd :
Aside , aside ; here is more matter for a hot brain : :
every lane 's end , every shop , church , session , :
hanging , yields a careful man work . :
Clown :
See , see ; what a man you are now ! :
There is no other way but to tell the king :
she 's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood . :
Shepherd :
Nay , but hear me . :
Clown :
Nay , but hear me . :
Shepherd :
Go to , then . :
Clown :
She being none of your flesh and blood , your flesh :
and blood has not offended the king ; and so your :
