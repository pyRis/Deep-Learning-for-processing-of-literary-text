And with your queen . I am his cupbearer : :
If from me he have wholesome beverage , :
Account me not your servant . :
LEONTES :
This is all : :
Do 't and thou hast the one half of my heart ; :
Do 't not , thou split 'st thine own . :
CAMILLO :
I 'll do 't , my lord . :
LEONTES :
I will seem friendly , as thou hast advised me . :
Exit :
CAMILLO :
O miserable lady ! But , for me , :
What case stand I in ? I must be the poisoner :
Of good Polixenes ; and my ground to do 't :
Is the obedience to a master , one :
Who in rebellion with himself will have :
All that are his so too . To do this deed , :
Promotion follows . If I could find example :
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings :
And flourish 'd after , I 'ld not do 't ; but since :
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one , :
Let villany itself forswear 't . I must :
Forsake the court : to do 't , or no , is certain :
To me a break-neck . Happy star , reign now ! :
Here comes Bohemia . :
Re-enter POLIXENES :
POLIXENES :
This is strange : methinks :
My favour here begins to warp . Not speak ? :
Good day , Camillo . :
CAMILLO :
Hail , most royal sir ! :
POLIXENES :
What is the news i ' the court ? :
CAMILLO :
None rare , my lord . :
POLIXENES :
The king hath on him such a countenance :
As he had lost some province and a region :
Loved as he loves himself : even now I met him :
With customary compliment ; when he , :
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling :
A lip of much contempt , speeds from me and :
So leaves me to consider what is breeding :
That changeth thus his manners . :
CAMILLO :
I dare not know , my lord . :
POLIXENES :
How ! dare not ! do not . Do you know , and dare not ? :
Be intelligent to me : ' tis thereabouts ; :
For , to yourself , what you do know , you must . :
And cannot say , you dare not . Good Camillo , :
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror :
Which shows me mine changed too ; for I must be :
A party in this alteration , finding :
Myself thus alter 'd with ' t . :
CAMILLO :
There is a sickness :
Which puts some of us in distemper , but :
I cannot name the disease ; and it is caught :
Of you that yet are well . :
POLIXENES :
How ! caught of me ! :
Make me not sighted like the basilisk : :
I have look 'd on thousands , who have sped the better :
By my regard , but kill 'd none so . Camillo , -- :
As you are certainly a gentleman , thereto :
Clerk-like experienced , which no less adorns :
Our gentry than our parents ' noble names , :
In whose success we are gentle , --I beseech you , :
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge :
Thereof to be inform 'd , imprison 't not :
In ignorant concealment . :
CAMILLO :
I may not answer . :
POLIXENES :
A sickness caught of me , and yet I well ! :
I must be answer 'd . Dost thou hear , Camillo , :
I conjure thee , by all the parts of man :
Which honour does acknowledge , whereof the least :
Is not this suit of mine , that thou declare :
What incidency thou dost guess of harm :
Is creeping toward me ; how far off , how near ; :
Which way to be prevented , if to be ; :
If not , how best to bear it . :
CAMILLO :
Sir , I will tell you ; :
Since I am charged in honour and by him :
That I think honourable : therefore mark my counsel , :
Which must be even as swiftly follow 'd as :
