Hot lavender , mints , savoury , marjoram ; :
The marigold , that goes to bed wi ' the sun :
And with him rises weeping : these are flowers :
Of middle summer , and I think they are given :
To men of middle age . You 're very welcome . :
CAMILLO :
I should leave grazing , were I of your flock , :
And only live by gazing . :
PERDITA :
Out , alas ! :
You 'd be so lean , that blasts of January :
Would blow you through and through . :
Now , my fair 'st friend , :
I would I had some flowers o ' the spring that might :
Become your time of day ; and yours , and yours , :
That wear upon your virgin branches yet :
Your maidenheads growing : O Proserpina , :
For the flowers now , that frighted thou let 'st fall :
From Dis 's waggon ! daffodils , :
That come before the swallow dares , and take :
The winds of March with beauty ; violets dim , :
But sweeter than the lids of Juno 's eyes :
Or Cytherea 's breath ; pale primroses :
That die unmarried , ere they can behold :
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady :
Most incident to maids ; bold oxlips and :
The crown imperial ; lilies of all kinds , :
The flower-de-luce being one ! O , these I lack , :
To make you garlands of , and my sweet friend , :
To strew him o 'er and o 'er ! :
FLORIZEL :
What , like a corse ? :
PERDITA :
No , like a bank for love to lie and play on ; :
Not like a corse ; or if , not to be buried , :
But quick and in mine arms . Come , take your flowers : :
Methinks I play as I have seen them do :
In Whitsun pastorals : sure this robe of mine :
Does change my disposition . :
FLORIZEL :
What you do :
Still betters what is done . When you speak , sweet . :
I 'ld have you do it ever : when you sing , :
I 'ld have you buy and sell so , so give alms , :
Pray so ; and , for the ordering your affairs , :
To sing them too : when you do dance , I wish you :
A wave o ' the sea , that you might ever do :
Nothing but that ; move still , still so , :
And own no other function : each your doing , :
So singular in each particular , :
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed , :
That all your acts are queens . :
PERDITA :
O Doricles , :
Your praises are too large : but that your youth , :
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through 't , :
Do plainly give you out an unstain 'd shepherd , :
With wisdom I might fear , my Doricles , :
You woo 'd me the false way . :
FLORIZEL :
I think you have :
As little skill to fear as I have purpose :
To put you to 't . But come ; our dance , I pray : :
Your hand , my Perdita : so turtles pair , :
That never mean to part . :
PERDITA :
I 'll swear for ' em . :
POLIXENES :
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever :
Ran on the green-sward : nothing she does or seems :
But smacks of something greater than herself , :
Too noble for this place . :
CAMILLO :
He tells her something :
That makes her blood look out : good sooth , she is :
The queen of curds and cream . :
Clown :
Come on , strike up ! :
DORCAS :
Mopsa must be your mistress : marry , garlic , :
To mend her kissing with ! :
MOPSA :
Now , in good time ! :
Clown :
Not a word , a word ; we stand upon our manners . :
Come , strike up ! :
Music . Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses :
POLIXENES :
Pray , good shepherd , what fair swain is this :
Which dances with your daughter ? :
