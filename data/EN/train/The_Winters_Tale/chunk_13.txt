But first I 'll do my errand . The good queen , :
For she is good , hath brought you forth a daughter ; :
Here ' tis ; commends it to your blessing . :
Laying down the child :
LEONTES :
Out ! :
A mankind witch ! Hence with her , out o ' door : :
A most intelligencing bawd ! :
PAULINA :
Not so : :
I am as ignorant in that as you :
In so entitling me , and no less honest :
Than you are mad ; which is enough , I 'll warrant , :
As this world goes , to pass for honest . :
LEONTES :
Traitors ! :
Will you not push her out ? Give her the bastard . :
Thou dotard ! thou art woman-tired , unroosted :
By thy dame Partlet here . Take up the bastard ; :
Take 't up , I say ; give 't to thy crone . :
PAULINA :
For ever :
Unvenerable be thy hands , if thou :
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness :
Which he has put upon 't ! :
LEONTES :
He dreads his wife . :
PAULINA :
So I would you did ; then ' twere past all doubt :
You 'ld call your children yours . :
LEONTES :
A nest of traitors ! :
ANTIGONUS :
I am none , by this good light . :
PAULINA :
Nor I , nor any :
But one that 's here , and that 's himself , for he :
The sacred honour of himself , his queen 's , :
His hopeful son 's , his babe 's , betrays to slander , :
Whose sting is sharper than the sword 's ; :
and will not-- :
For , as the case now stands , it is a curse :
He cannot be compell 'd to 't--once remove :
The root of his opinion , which is rotten :
As ever oak or stone was sound . :
LEONTES :
A callat :
Of boundless tongue , who late hath beat her husband :
And now baits me ! This brat is none of mine ; :
It is the issue of Polixenes : :
Hence with it , and together with the dam :
Commit them to the fire ! :
PAULINA :
It is yours ; :
And , might we lay the old proverb to your charge , :
So like you , ' tis the worse . Behold , my lords , :
Although the print be little , the whole matter :
And copy of the father , eye , nose , lip , :
The trick of 's frown , his forehead , nay , the valley , :
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek , :
His smiles , :
The very mould and frame of hand , nail , finger : :
And thou , good goddess Nature , which hast made it :
So like to him that got it , if thou hast :
The ordering of the mind too , ' mongst all colours :
No yellow in 't , lest she suspect , as he does , :
Her children not her husband 's ! :
LEONTES :
A gross hag :
And , lozel , thou art worthy to be hang 'd , :
That wilt not stay her tongue . :
ANTIGONUS :
Hang all the husbands :
That cannot do that feat , you 'll leave yourself :
Hardly one subject . :
LEONTES :
Once more , take her hence . :
PAULINA :
A most unworthy and unnatural lord :
Can do no more . :
LEONTES :
I 'll ha ' thee burnt . :
PAULINA :
I care not : :
It is an heretic that makes the fire , :
Not she which burns in 't . I 'll not call you tyrant ; :
But this most cruel usage of your queen , :
Not able to produce more accusation :
Than your own weak-hinged fancy , something savours :
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you , :
Yea , scandalous to the world . :
LEONTES :
On your allegiance , :
Out of the chamber with her ! Were I a tyrant , :
Where were her life ? she durst not call me so , :
