Against this cruelty fight on thy side , :
Poor thing , condemn 'd to loss ! :
Exit with the child :
LEONTES :
No , I 'll not rear :
Another 's issue . :
Servant :
Please your highness , posts :
From those you sent to the oracle are come :
An hour since : Cleomenes and Dion , :
Being well arrived from Delphos , are both landed , :
Hasting to the court . :
First Lord :
So please you , sir , their speed :
Hath been beyond account . :
LEONTES :
Twenty-three days :
They have been absent : ' tis good speed ; foretells :
The great Apollo suddenly will have :
The truth of this appear . Prepare you , lords ; :
Summon a session , that we may arraign :
Our most disloyal lady , for , as she hath :
Been publicly accused , so shall she have :
A just and open trial . While she lives :
My heart will be a burthen to me . Leave me , :
And think upon my bidding . :
ACT III :
SCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia . :
CLEOMENES :
The climate 's delicate , the air most sweet , :
Fertile the isle , the temple much surpassing :
The common praise it bears . :
DION :
I shall report , :
For most it caught me , the celestial habits , :
Methinks I so should term them , and the reverence :
Of the grave wearers . O , the sacrifice ! :
How ceremonious , solemn and unearthly :
It was i ' the offering ! :
CLEOMENES :
But of all , the burst :
And the ear-deafening voice o ' the oracle , :
Kin to Jove 's thunder , so surprised my sense . :
That I was nothing . :
DION :
If the event o ' the journey :
Prove as successful to the queen , --O be 't so ! -- :
As it hath been to us rare , pleasant , speedy , :
The time is worth the use on 't . :
CLEOMENES :
Great Apollo :
Turn all to the best ! These proclamations , :
So forcing faults upon Hermione , :
I little like . :
DION :
The violent carriage of it :
Will clear or end the business : when the oracle , :
Thus by Apollo 's great divine seal 'd up , :
Shall the contents discover , something rare :
Even then will rush to knowledge . Go : fresh horses ! :
And gracious be the issue ! :
SCENE II . A court of Justice . :
LEONTES :
This sessions , to our great grief we pronounce , :
Even pushes ' gainst our heart : the party tried :
The daughter of a king , our wife , and one :
Of us too much beloved . Let us be clear 'd :
Of being tyrannous , since we so openly :
Proceed in justice , which shall have due course , :
Even to the guilt or the purgation . :
Produce the prisoner . :
Officer :
It is his highness ' pleasure that the queen :
Appear in person here in court . Silence ! :
LEONTES :
Read the indictment . :
Officer :
[ Reads ] Hermione , queen to the worthy :
Leontes , king of Sicilia , thou art here accused and :
arraigned of high treason , in committing adultery :
with Polixenes , king of Bohemia , and conspiring :
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign :
lord the king , thy royal husband : the pretence :
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open , :
thou , Hermione , contrary to the faith and allegiance :
of a true subject , didst counsel and aid them , for :
their better safety , to fly away by night . :
HERMIONE :
Since what I am to say must be but that :
Which contradicts my accusation and :
The testimony on my part no other :
But what comes from myself , it shall scarce boot me :
To say ' not guilty : ' mine integrity :
Being counted falsehood , shall , as I express it , :
Be so received . But thus : if powers divine :
