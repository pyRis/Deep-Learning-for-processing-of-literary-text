preposterous estate as we are . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I humbly beseech you , sir , to pardon me all the :
faults I have committed to your worship and to give :
me your good report to the prince my master . :
Shepherd :
Prithee , son , do ; for we must be gentle , now we are :
gentlemen . :
Clown :
Thou wilt amend thy life ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Ay , an it like your good worship . :
Clown :
Give me thy hand : I will swear to the prince thou :
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia . :
Shepherd :
You may say it , but not swear it . :
Clown :
Not swear it , now I am a gentleman ? Let boors and :
franklins say it , I 'll swear it . :
Shepherd :
How if it be false , son ? :
Clown :
If it be ne 'er so false , a true gentleman may swear :
it in the behalf of his friend : and I 'll swear to :
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and :
that thou wilt not be drunk ; but I know thou art no :
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be :
drunk : but I 'll swear it , and I would thou wouldst :
be a tall fellow of thy hands . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I will prove so , sir , to my power . :
Clown :
Ay , by any means prove a tall fellow : if I do not :
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk , not :
being a tall fellow , trust me not . Hark ! the kings :
and the princes , our kindred , are going to see the :
queen 's picture . Come , follow us : we 'll be thy :
good masters . :
SCENE III . A chapel in PAULINA 'S house . :
LEONTES :
O grave and good Paulina , the great comfort :
That I have had of thee ! :
PAULINA :
What , sovereign sir , :
I did not well I meant well . All my services :
You have paid home : but that you have vouchsafed , :
With your crown 'd brother and these your contracted :
Heirs of your kingdoms , my poor house to visit , :
It is a surplus of your grace , which never :
My life may last to answer . :
LEONTES :
O Paulina , :
We honour you with trouble : but we came :
To see the statue of our queen : your gallery :
Have we pass 'd through , not without much content :
In many singularities ; but we saw not :
That which my daughter came to look upon , :
The statue of her mother . :
PAULINA :
As she lived peerless , :
So her dead likeness , I do well believe , :
Excels whatever yet you look 'd upon :
Or hand of man hath done ; therefore I keep it :
Lonely , apart . But here it is : prepare :
To see the life as lively mock 'd as ever :
Still sleep mock 'd death : behold , and say ' tis well . :
PAULINA draws a curtain , and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue :
I like your silence , it the more shows off :
Your wonder : but yet speak ; first , you , my liege , :
Comes it not something near ? :
LEONTES :
Her natural posture ! :
Chide me , dear stone , that I may say indeed :
Thou art Hermione ; or rather , thou art she :
In thy not chiding , for she was as tender :
As infancy and grace . But yet , Paulina , :
Hermione was not so much wrinkled , nothing :
So aged as this seems . :
POLIXENES :
O , not by much . :
PAULINA :
So much the more our carver 's excellence ; :
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her :
As she lived now . :
LEONTES :
As now she might have done , :
So much to my good comfort , as it is :
