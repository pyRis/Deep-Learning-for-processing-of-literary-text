and , having flown over many knavish professions , he :
settled only in rogue : some call him Autolycus . :
Clown :
Out upon him ! prig , for my life , prig : he haunts :
wakes , fairs and bear-baitings . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Very true , sir ; he , sir , he ; that 's the rogue that :
put me into this apparel . :
Clown :
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia : if you had :
but looked big and spit at him , he 'ld have run . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I must confess to you , sir , I am no fighter : I am :
false of heart that way ; and that he knew , I warrant :
him . :
Clown :
How do you now ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Sweet sir , much better than I was ; I can stand and :
walk : I will even take my leave of you , and pace :
softly towards my kinsman 's . :
Clown :
Shall I bring thee on the way ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
No , good-faced sir ; no , sweet sir . :
Clown :
Then fare thee well : I must go buy spices for our :
sheep-shearing . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Prosper you , sweet sir ! :
Exit Clown :
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice . :
I 'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too : if I :
make not this cheat bring out another and the :
shearers prove sheep , let me be unrolled and my name :
put in the book of virtue ! :
Sings :
Jog on , jog on , the foot-path way , :
And merrily hent the stile-a : :
A merry heart goes all the day , :
Your sad tires in a mile-a . :
Exit :
SCENE IV . The Shepherd 's cottage . :
FLORIZEL :
These your unusual weeds to each part of you :
Do give a life : no shepherdess , but Flora :
Peering in April 's front . This your sheep-shearing :
Is as a meeting of the petty gods , :
And you the queen on 't . :
PERDITA :
Sir , my gracious lord , :
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me : :
O , pardon , that I name them ! Your high self , :
The gracious mark o ' the land , you have obscured :
With a swain 's wearing , and me , poor lowly maid , :
Most goddess-like prank 'd up : but that our feasts :
In every mess have folly and the feeders :
Digest it with a custom , I should blush :
To see you so attired , sworn , I think , :
To show myself a glass . :
FLORIZEL :
I bless the time :
When my good falcon made her flight across :
Thy father 's ground . :
PERDITA :
Now Jove afford you cause ! :
To me the difference forges dread ; your greatness :
Hath not been used to fear . Even now I tremble :
To think your father , by some accident , :
Should pass this way as you did : O , the Fates ! :
How would he look , to see his work so noble :
Vilely bound up ? What would he say ? Or how :
Should I , in these my borrow 'd flaunts , behold :
The sternness of his presence ? :
FLORIZEL :
Apprehend :
Nothing but jollity . The gods themselves , :
Humbling their deities to love , have taken :
The shapes of beasts upon them : Jupiter :
Became a bull , and bellow 'd ; the green Neptune :
A ram , and bleated ; and the fire-robed god , :
Golden Apollo , a poor humble swain , :
As I seem now . Their transformations :
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer , :
Nor in a way so chaste , since my desires :
Run not before mine honour , nor my lusts :
Burn hotter than my faith . :
PERDITA :
O , but , sir , :
Your resolution cannot hold , when ' tis :
Opposed , as it must be , by the power of the king : :
