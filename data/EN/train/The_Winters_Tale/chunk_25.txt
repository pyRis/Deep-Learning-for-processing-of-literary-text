Which then will speak , that you must :
change this purpose , :
Or I my life . :
FLORIZEL :
Thou dearest Perdita , :
With these forced thoughts , I prithee , darken not :
The mirth o ' the feast . Or I 'll be thine , my fair , :
Or not my father 's . For I cannot be :
Mine own , nor any thing to any , if :
I be not thine . To this I am most constant , :
Though destiny say no . Be merry , gentle ; :
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing :
That you behold the while . Your guests are coming : :
Lift up your countenance , as it were the day :
Of celebration of that nuptial which :
We two have sworn shall come . :
PERDITA :
O lady Fortune , :
Stand you auspicious ! :
FLORIZEL :
See , your guests approach : :
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly , :
And let 's be red with mirth . :
Shepherd :
Fie , daughter ! when my old wife lived , upon :
This day she was both pantler , butler , cook , :
Both dame and servant ; welcomed all , served all ; :
Would sing her song and dance her turn ; now here , :
At upper end o ' the table , now i ' the middle ; :
On his shoulder , and his ; her face o ' fire :
With labour and the thing she took to quench it , :
She would to each one sip . You are retired , :
As if you were a feasted one and not :
The hostess of the meeting : pray you , bid :
These unknown friends to 's welcome ; for it is :
A way to make us better friends , more known . :
Come , quench your blushes and present yourself :
That which you are , mistress o ' the feast : come on , :
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing , :
As your good flock shall prosper . :
PERDITA :
[ To POLIXENES ] Sir , welcome : :
It is my father 's will I should take on me :
The hostess-ship o ' the day . :
To CAMILLO :
You 're welcome , sir . :
Give me those flowers there , Dorcas . Reverend sirs , :
For you there 's rosemary and rue ; these keep :
Seeming and savour all the winter long : :
Grace and remembrance be to you both , :
And welcome to our shearing ! :
POLIXENES :
Shepherdess , :
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages :
With flowers of winter . :
PERDITA :
Sir , the year growing ancient , :
Not yet on summer 's death , nor on the birth :
Of trembling winter , the fairest :
flowers o ' the season :
Are our carnations and streak 'd gillyvors , :
Which some call nature 's bastards : of that kind :
Our rustic garden 's barren ; and I care not :
To get slips of them . :
POLIXENES :
Wherefore , gentle maiden , :
Do you neglect them ? :
PERDITA :
For I have heard it said :
There is an art which in their piedness shares :
With great creating nature . :
POLIXENES :
Say there be ; :
Yet nature is made better by no mean :
But nature makes that mean : so , over that art :
Which you say adds to nature , is an art :
That nature makes . You see , sweet maid , we marry :
A gentler scion to the wildest stock , :
And make conceive a bark of baser kind :
By bud of nobler race : this is an art :
Which does mend nature , change it rather , but :
The art itself is nature . :
PERDITA :
So it is . :
POLIXENES :
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors , :
And do not call them bastards . :
PERDITA :
I 'll not put :
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them ; :
No more than were I painted I would wish :
This youth should say ' twere well and only therefore :
