those things you found about her , those secret :
things , all but what she has with her : this being :
done , let the law go whistle : I warrant you . :
Shepherd :
I will tell the king all , every word , yea , and his :
son 's pranks too ; who , I may say , is no honest man , :
neither to his father nor to me , to go about to make :
me the king 's brother-in-law . :
Clown :
Indeed , brother-in-law was the farthest off you :
could have been to him and then your blood had been :
the dearer by I know how much an ounce . :
AUTOLYCUS :
[ Aside ] Very wisely , puppies ! :
Shepherd :
Well , let us to the king : there is that in this :
fardel will make him scratch his beard . :
AUTOLYCUS :
[ Aside ] I know not what impediment this complaint :
may be to the flight of my master . :
Clown :
Pray heartily he be at palace . :
AUTOLYCUS :
[ Aside ] Though I am not naturally honest , I am so :
sometimes by chance : let me pocket up my pedlar 's excrement . :
Takes off his false beard :
How now , rustics ! whither are you bound ? :
Shepherd :
To the palace , an it like your worship . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Your affairs there , what , with whom , the condition :
of that fardel , the place of your dwelling , your :
names , your ages , of what having , breeding , and any :
thing that is fitting to be known , discover . :
Clown :
We are but plain fellows , sir . :
AUTOLYCUS :
A lie ; you are rough and hairy . Let me have no :
lying : it becomes none but tradesmen , and they :
often give us soldiers the lie : but we pay them for :
it with stamped coin , not stabbing steel ; therefore :
they do not give us the lie . :
Clown :
Your worship had like to have given us one , if you :
had not taken yourself with the manner . :
Shepherd :
Are you a courtier , an 't like you , sir ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Whether it like me or no , I am a courtier . Seest :
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings ? :
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court ? :
receives not thy nose court-odor from me ? reflect I :
not on thy baseness court-contempt ? Thinkest thou , :
for that I insinuate , or toaze from thee thy :
business , I am therefore no courtier ? I am courtier :
cap-a-pe ; and one that will either push on or pluck :
back thy business there : whereupon I command thee to :
open thy affair . :
Shepherd :
My business , sir , is to the king . :
AUTOLYCUS :
What advocate hast thou to him ? :
Shepherd :
I know not , an 't like you . :
Clown :
Advocate 's the court-word for a pheasant : say you :
have none . :
Shepherd :
None , sir ; I have no pheasant , cock nor hen . :
AUTOLYCUS :
How blessed are we that are not simple men ! :
Yet nature might have made me as these are , :
Therefore I will not disdain . :
Clown :
This cannot be but a great courtier . :
Shepherd :
His garments are rich , but he wears :
them not handsomely . :
Clown :
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical : :
a great man , I 'll warrant ; I know by the picking :
on 's teeth . :
AUTOLYCUS :
The fardel there ? what 's i ' the fardel ? :
Wherefore that box ? :
Shepherd :
Sir , there lies such secrets in this fardel and box , :
which none must know but the king ; and which he :
shall know within this hour , if I may come to the :
speech of him . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Age , thou hast lost thy labour . :
Shepherd :
