Thereof most worthy , were I the fairest youth :
That ever made eye swerve , had force and knowledge :
More than was ever man 's , I would not prize them :
Without her love ; for her employ them all ; :
Commend them and condemn them to her service :
Or to their own perdition . :
POLIXENES :
Fairly offer 'd . :
CAMILLO :
This shows a sound affection . :
Shepherd :
But , my daughter , :
Say you the like to him ? :
PERDITA :
I cannot speak :
So well , nothing so well ; no , nor mean better : :
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out :
The purity of his . :
Shepherd :
Take hands , a bargain ! :
And , friends unknown , you shall bear witness to ' t : :
I give my daughter to him , and will make :
Her portion equal his . :
FLORIZEL :
O , that must be :
I ' the virtue of your daughter : one being dead , :
I shall have more than you can dream of yet ; :
Enough then for your wonder . But , come on , :
Contract us ' fore these witnesses . :
Shepherd :
Come , your hand ; :
And , daughter , yours . :
POLIXENES :
Soft , swain , awhile , beseech you ; :
Have you a father ? :
FLORIZEL :
I have : but what of him ? :
POLIXENES :
Knows he of this ? :
FLORIZEL :
He neither does nor shall . :
POLIXENES :
Methinks a father :
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest :
That best becomes the table . Pray you once more , :
Is not your father grown incapable :
Of reasonable affairs ? is he not stupid :
With age and altering rheums ? can he speak ? hear ? :
Know man from man ? dispute his own estate ? :
Lies he not bed-rid ? and again does nothing :
But what he did being childish ? :
FLORIZEL :
No , good sir ; :
He has his health and ampler strength indeed :
Than most have of his age . :
POLIXENES :
By my white beard , :
You offer him , if this be so , a wrong :
Something unfilial : reason my son :
Should choose himself a wife , but as good reason :
The father , all whose joy is nothing else :
But fair posterity , should hold some counsel :
In such a business . :
FLORIZEL :
I yield all this ; :
But for some other reasons , my grave sir , :
Which ' tis not fit you know , I not acquaint :
My father of this business . :
POLIXENES :
Let him know 't . :
FLORIZEL :
He shall not . :
POLIXENES :
Prithee , let him . :
FLORIZEL :
No , he must not . :
Shepherd :
Let him , my son : he shall not need to grieve :
At knowing of thy choice . :
FLORIZEL :
Come , come , he must not . :
Mark our contract . :
POLIXENES :
Mark your divorce , young sir , :
Discovering himself :
Whom son I dare not call ; thou art too base :
To be acknowledged : thou a sceptre 's heir , :
That thus affect 'st a sheep-hook ! Thou old traitor , :
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can :
But shorten thy life one week . And thou , fresh piece :
Of excellent witchcraft , who of force must know :
The royal fool thou copest with , -- :
Shepherd :
O , my heart ! :
POLIXENES :
I 'll have thy beauty scratch 'd with briers , and made :
More homely than thy state . For thee , fond boy , :
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh :
That thou no more shalt see this knack , as never :
I mean thou shalt , we 'll bar thee from succession ; :
Not hold thee of our blood , no , not our kin , :
Far than Deucalion off : mark thou my words : :
Follow us to the court . Thou churl , for this time , :
