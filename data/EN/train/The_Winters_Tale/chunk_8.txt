Or a half-moon made with a pen . :
Second Lady :
Who taught you this ? :
MAMILLIUS :
I learnt it out of women 's faces . Pray now :
What colour are your eyebrows ? :
First Lady :
Blue , my lord . :
MAMILLIUS :
Nay , that 's a mock : I have seen a lady 's nose :
That has been blue , but not her eyebrows . :
First Lady :
Hark ye ; :
The queen your mother rounds apace : we shall :
Present our services to a fine new prince :
One of these days ; and then you 'ld wanton with us , :
If we would have you . :
Second Lady :
She is spread of late :
Into a goodly bulk : good time encounter her ! :
HERMIONE :
What wisdom stirs amongst you ? Come , sir , now :
I am for you again : pray you , sit by us , :
And tell ' s a tale . :
MAMILLIUS :
Merry or sad shall 't be ? :
HERMIONE :
As merry as you will . :
MAMILLIUS :
A sad tale 's best for winter : I have one :
Of sprites and goblins . :
HERMIONE :
Let 's have that , good sir . :
Come on , sit down : come on , and do your best :
To fright me with your sprites ; you 're powerful at it . :
MAMILLIUS :
There was a man-- :
HERMIONE :
Nay , come , sit down ; then on . :
MAMILLIUS :
Dwelt by a churchyard : I will tell it softly ; :
Yond crickets shall not hear it . :
HERMIONE :
Come on , then , :
And give 't me in mine ear . :
LEONTES :
Was he met there ? his train ? Camillo with him ? :
First Lord :
Behind the tuft of pines I met them ; never :
Saw I men scour so on their way : I eyed them :
Even to their ships . :
LEONTES :
How blest am I :
In my just censure , in my true opinion ! :
Alack , for lesser knowledge ! how accursed :
In being so blest ! There may be in the cup :
A spider steep 'd , and one may drink , depart , :
And yet partake no venom , for his knowledge :
Is not infected : but if one present :
The abhorr 'd ingredient to his eye , make known :
How he hath drunk , he cracks his gorge , his sides , :
With violent hefts . I have drunk , :
and seen the spider . :
Camillo was his help in this , his pander : :
There is a plot against my life , my crown ; :
All 's true that is mistrusted : that false villain :
Whom I employ 'd was pre-employ 'd by him : :
He has discover 'd my design , and I :
Remain a pinch 'd thing ; yea , a very trick :
For them to play at will . How came the posterns :
So easily open ? :
First Lord :
By his great authority ; :
Which often hath no less prevail 'd than so :
On your command . :
LEONTES :
I know 't too well . :
Give me the boy : I am glad you did not nurse him : :
Though he does bear some signs of me , yet you :
Have too much blood in him . :
HERMIONE :
What is this ? sport ? :
LEONTES :
Bear the boy hence ; he shall not come about her ; :
Away with him ! and let her sport herself :
With that she 's big with ; for ' tis Polixenes :
Has made thee swell thus . :
HERMIONE :
But I 'ld say he had not , :
And I 'll be sworn you would believe my saying , :
Howe 'er you lean to the nayward . :
LEONTES :
You , my lords , :
Look on her , mark her well ; be but about :
To say ' she is a goodly lady , ' and :
The justice of your bearts will thereto add :
'Tis pity she 's not honest , honourable : ' :
