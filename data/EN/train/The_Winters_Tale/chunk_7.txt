Cry lost , and so good night ! :
POLIXENES :
On , good Camillo . :
CAMILLO :
I am appointed him to murder you . :
POLIXENES :
By whom , Camillo ? :
CAMILLO :
By the king . :
POLIXENES :
For what ? :
CAMILLO :
He thinks , nay , with all confidence he swears , :
As he had seen 't or been an instrument :
To vice you to 't , that you have touch 'd his queen :
Forbiddenly . :
POLIXENES :
O , then my best blood turn :
To an infected jelly and my name :
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best ! :
Turn then my freshest reputation to :
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril :
Where I arrive , and my approach be shunn 'd , :
Nay , hated too , worse than the great 'st infection :
That e 'er was heard or read ! :
CAMILLO :
Swear his thought over :
By each particular star in heaven and :
By all their influences , you may as well :
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon :
As or by oath remove or counsel shake :
The fabric of his folly , whose foundation :
Is piled upon his faith and will continue :
The standing of his body . :
POLIXENES :
How should this grow ? :
CAMILLO :
I know not : but I am sure ' tis safer to :
Avoid what 's grown than question how ' tis born . :
If therefore you dare trust my honesty , :
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you :
Shall bear along impawn 'd , away to-night ! :
Your followers I will whisper to the business , :
And will by twos and threes at several posterns :
Clear them o ' the city . For myself , I 'll put :
My fortunes to your service , which are here :
By this discovery lost . Be not uncertain ; :
For , by the honour of my parents , I :
Have utter 'd truth : which if you seek to prove , :
I dare not stand by ; nor shall you be safer :
Than one condemn 'd by the king 's own mouth , thereon :
His execution sworn . :
POLIXENES :
I do believe thee : :
I saw his heart in ' s face . Give me thy hand : :
Be pilot to me and thy places shall :
Still neighbour mine . My ships are ready and :
My people did expect my hence departure :
Two days ago . This jealousy :
Is for a precious creature : as she 's rare , :
Must it be great , and as his person 's mighty , :
Must it be violent , and as he does conceive :
He is dishonour 'd by a man which ever :
Profess 'd to him , why , his revenges must :
In that be made more bitter . Fear o 'ershades me : :
Good expedition be my friend , and comfort :
The gracious queen , part of his theme , but nothing :
Of his ill-ta 'en suspicion ! Come , Camillo ; :
I will respect thee as a father if :
Thou bear 'st my life off hence : let us avoid . :
CAMILLO :
It is in mine authority to command :
The keys of all the posterns : please your highness :
To take the urgent hour . Come , sir , away . :
ACT II :
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES ' palace . :
HERMIONE :
Take the boy to you : he so troubles me , :
'Tis past enduring . :
First Lady :
Come , my gracious lord , :
Shall I be your playfellow ? :
MAMILLIUS :
No , I 'll none of you . :
First Lady :
Why , my sweet lord ? :
MAMILLIUS :
You 'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if :
I were a baby still . I love you better . :
Second Lady :
And why so , my lord ? :
MAMILLIUS :
Not for because :
Your brows are blacker ; yet black brows , they say , :
Become some women best , so that there be not :
