paid you more , which will shame you to give him again . :
Clown :
Is there no manners left among maids ? will they :
wear their plackets where they should bear their :
faces ? Is there not milking-time , when you are :
going to bed , or kiln-hole , to whistle off these :
secrets , but you must be tittle-tattling before all :
our guests ? ' tis well they are whispering : clamour :
your tongues , and not a word more . :
MOPSA :
I have done . Come , you promised me a tawdry-lace :
and a pair of sweet gloves . :
Clown :
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way :
and lost all my money ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
And indeed , sir , there are cozeners abroad ; :
therefore it behoves men to be wary . :
Clown :
Fear not thou , man , thou shalt lose nothing here . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I hope so , sir ; for I have about me many parcels of charge . :
Clown :
What hast here ? ballads ? :
MOPSA :
Pray now , buy some : I love a ballad in print o ' :
life , for then we are sure they are true . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Here 's one to a very doleful tune , how a usurer 's :
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a :
burthen and how she longed to eat adders ' heads and :
toads carbonadoed . :
MOPSA :
Is it true , think you ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Very true , and but a month old . :
DORCAS :
Bless me from marrying a usurer ! :
AUTOLYCUS :
Here 's the midwife 's name to 't , one Mistress :
Tale-porter , and five or six honest wives that were :
present . Why should I carry lies abroad ? :
MOPSA :
Pray you now , buy it . :
Clown :
Come on , lay it by : and let 's first see moe :
ballads ; we 'll buy the other things anon . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Here 's another ballad of a fish , that appeared upon :
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April , :
forty thousand fathom above water , and sung this :
ballad against the hard hearts of maids : it was :
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold :
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that :
loved her : the ballad is very pitiful and as true . :
DORCAS :
Is it true too , think you ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Five justices ' hands at it , and witnesses more than :
my pack will hold . :
Clown :
Lay it by too : another . :
AUTOLYCUS :
This is a merry ballad , but a very pretty one . :
MOPSA :
Let 's have some merry ones . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Why , this is a passing merry one and goes to :
the tune of ' Two maids wooing a man : ' there 's :
scarce a maid westward but she sings it ; ' tis in :
request , I can tell you . :
MOPSA :
We can both sing it : if thou 'lt bear a part , thou :
shalt hear ; ' tis in three parts . :
DORCAS :
We had the tune on 't a month ago . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I can bear my part ; you must know ' tis my :
occupation ; have at it with you . :
SONG :
AUTOLYCUS :
Get you hence , for I must go :
Where it fits not you to know . :
DORCAS :
Whither ? :
MOPSA :
O , whither ? :
DORCAS :
Whither ? :
MOPSA :
It becomes thy oath full well , :
Thou to me thy secrets tell . :
DORCAS :
Me too , let me go thither . :
MOPSA :
Or thou goest to the orange or mill . :
DORCAS :
If to either , thou dost ill . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Neither . :
DORCAS :
What , neither ? :
AUTOLYCUS :
Neither . :
DORCAS :
Thou hast sworn my love to be . :
MOPSA :
Thou hast sworn it more to me : :
