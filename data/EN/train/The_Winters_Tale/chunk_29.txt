Clown :
We 'll have this song out anon by ourselves : my :
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk , and we 'll :
not trouble them . Come , bring away thy pack after :
me . Wenches , I 'll buy for you both . Pedlar , let 's :
have the first choice . Follow me , girls . :
Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA :
AUTOLYCUS :
And you shall pay well for ' em . :
Follows singing :
Will you buy any tape , :
Or lace for your cape , :
My dainty duck , my dear-a ? :
Any silk , any thread , :
Any toys for your head , :
Of the new 'st and finest , finest wear-a ? :
Come to the pedlar ; :
Money 's a medler . :
That doth utter all men 's ware-a . :
Exit :
Re-enter Servant :
Servant :
Master , there is three carters , three shepherds , :
three neat-herds , three swine-herds , that have made :
themselves all men of hair , they call themselves :
Saltiers , and they have a dance which the wenches :
say is a gallimaufry of gambols , because they are :
not in 't ; but they themselves are o ' the mind , if it :
be not too rough for some that know little but :
bowling , it will please plentifully . :
Shepherd :
Away ! we 'll none on ' t : here has been too much :
homely foolery already . I know , sir , we weary you . :
POLIXENES :
You weary those that refresh us : pray , let 's see :
these four threes of herdsmen . :
Servant :
One three of them , by their own report , sir , hath :
danced before the king ; and not the worst of the :
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier . :
Shepherd :
Leave your prating : since these good men are :
pleased , let them come in ; but quickly now . :
Servant :
Why , they stay at door , sir . :
Exit :
Here a dance of twelve Satyrs :
POLIXENES :
O , father , you 'll know more of that hereafter . :
To CAMILLO :
Is it not too far gone ? ' Tis time to part them . :
He 's simple and tells much . :
To FLORIZEL :
How now , fair shepherd ! :
Your heart is full of something that does take :
Your mind from feasting . Sooth , when I was young :
And handed love as you do , I was wont :
To load my she with knacks : I would have ransack 'd :
The pedlar 's silken treasury and have pour 'd it :
To her acceptance ; you have let him go :
And nothing marted with him . If your lass :
Interpretation should abuse and call this :
Your lack of love or bounty , you were straited :
For a reply , at least if you make a care :
Of happy holding her . :
FLORIZEL :
Old sir , I know :
She prizes not such trifles as these are : :
The gifts she looks from me are pack 'd and lock 'd :
Up in my heart ; which I have given already , :
But not deliver 'd . O , hear me breathe my life :
Before this ancient sir , who , it should seem , :
Hath sometime loved ! I take thy hand , this hand , :
As soft as dove 's down and as white as it , :
Or Ethiopian 's tooth , or the fann 'd :
snow that 's bolted :
By the northern blasts twice o 'er . :
POLIXENES :
What follows this ? :
How prettily the young swain seems to wash :
The hand was fair before ! I have put you out : :
But to your protestation ; let me hear :
What you profess . :
FLORIZEL :
Do , and be witness to ' t . :
POLIXENES :
And this my neighbour too ? :
FLORIZEL :
And he , and more :
Than he , and men , the earth , the heavens , and all : :
