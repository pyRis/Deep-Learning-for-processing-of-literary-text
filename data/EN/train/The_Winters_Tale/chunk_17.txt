The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth , :
Haled out to murder : myself on every post :
Proclaimed a strumpet : with immodest hatred :
The child-bed privilege denied , which ' longs :
To women of all fashion ; lastly , hurried :
Here to this place , i ' the open air , before :
I have got strength of limit . Now , my liege , :
Tell me what blessings I have here alive , :
That I should fear to die ? Therefore proceed . :
But yet hear this : mistake me not ; no life , :
I prize it not a straw , but for mine honour , :
Which I would free , if I shall be condemn 'd :
Upon surmises , all proofs sleeping else :
But what your jealousies awake , I tell you :
'Tis rigor and not law . Your honours all , :
I do refer me to the oracle : :
Apollo be my judge ! :
First Lord :
This your request :
Is altogether just : therefore bring forth , :
And in Apollos name , his oracle . :
HERMIONE :
The Emperor of Russia was my father : :
O that he were alive , and here beholding :
His daughter 's trial ! that he did but see :
The flatness of my misery , yet with eyes :
Of pity , not revenge ! :
Re-enter Officers , with CLEOMENES and DION :
Officer :
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice , :
That you , Cleomenes and Dion , have :
Been both at Delphos , and from thence have brought :
The seal 'd-up oracle , by the hand deliver 'd :
Of great Apollo 's priest ; and that , since then , :
You have not dared to break the holy seal :
Nor read the secrets in 't . :
CLEOMENES DION :
All this we swear . :
LEONTES :
Break up the seals and read . :
Officer :
[ Reads ] Hermione is chaste ; :
Polixenes blameless ; Camillo a true subject ; Leontes :
a jealous tyrant ; his innocent babe truly begotten ; :
and the king shall live without an heir , if that :
which is lost be not found . :
Lords :
Now blessed be the great Apollo ! :
HERMIONE :
Praised ! :
LEONTES :
Hast thou read truth ? :
Officer :
Ay , my lord ; even so :
As it is here set down . :
LEONTES :
There is no truth at all i ' the oracle : :
The sessions shall proceed : this is mere falsehood . :
Servant :
My lord the king , the king ! :
LEONTES :
What is the business ? :
Servant :
O sir , I shall be hated to report it ! :
The prince your son , with mere conceit and fear :
Of the queen 's speed , is gone . :
LEONTES :
How ! gone ! :
Servant :
Is dead . :
LEONTES :
Apollo 's angry ; and the heavens themselves :
Do strike at my injustice . :
HERMIONE swoons :
How now there ! :
PAULINA :
This news is mortal to the queen : look down :
And see what death is doing . :
LEONTES :
Take her hence : :
Her heart is but o 'ercharged ; she will recover : :
I have too much believed mine own suspicion : :
Beseech you , tenderly apply to her :
Some remedies for life . :
Apollo , pardon :
My great profaneness ' gainst thine oracle ! :
I 'll reconcile me to Polixenes , :
New woo my queen , recall the good Camillo , :
Whom I proclaim a man of truth , of mercy ; :
For , being transported by my jealousies :
To bloody thoughts and to revenge , I chose :
Camillo for the minister to poison :
My friend Polixenes : which had been done , :
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied :
My swift command , though I with death and with :
Reward did threaten and encourage him , :
Not doing ' t and being done : he , most humane :
And fill 'd with honour , to my kingly guest :
Unclasp 'd my practise , quit his fortunes here , :
