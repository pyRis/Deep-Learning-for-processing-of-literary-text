Bohemia greets you from himself by me ; :
Desires you to attach his son , who has-- :
His dignity and duty both cast off-- :
Fled from his father , from his hopes , and with :
A shepherd 's daughter . :
LEONTES :
Where 's Bohemia ? speak . :
Lord :
Here in your city ; I now came from him : :
I speak amazedly ; and it becomes :
My marvel and my message . To your court :
Whiles he was hastening , in the chase , it seems , :
Of this fair couple , meets he on the way :
The father of this seeming lady and :
Her brother , having both their country quitted :
With this young prince . :
FLORIZEL :
Camillo has betray 'd me ; :
Whose honour and whose honesty till now :
Endured all weathers . :
Lord :
Lay 't so to his charge : :
He 's with the king your father . :
LEONTES :
Who ? Camillo ? :
Lord :
Camillo , sir ; I spake with him ; who now :
Has these poor men in question . Never saw I :
Wretches so quake : they kneel , they kiss the earth ; :
Forswear themselves as often as they speak : :
Bohemia stops his ears , and threatens them :
With divers deaths in death . :
PERDITA :
O my poor father ! :
The heaven sets spies upon us , will not have :
Our contract celebrated . :
LEONTES :
You are married ? :
FLORIZEL :
We are not , sir , nor are we like to be ; :
The stars , I see , will kiss the valleys first : :
The odds for high and low 's alike . :
LEONTES :
My lord , :
Is this the daughter of a king ? :
FLORIZEL :
She is , :
When once she is my wife . :
LEONTES :
That ' once ' I see by your good father 's speed :
Will come on very slowly . I am sorry , :
Most sorry , you have broken from his liking :
Where you were tied in duty , and as sorry :
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty , :
That you might well enjoy her . :
FLORIZEL :
Dear , look up : :
Though Fortune , visible an enemy , :
Should chase us with my father , power no jot :
Hath she to change our loves . Beseech you , sir , :
Remember since you owed no more to time :
Than I do now : with thought of such affections , :
Step forth mine advocate ; at your request :
My father will grant precious things as trifles . :
LEONTES :
Would he do so , I 'ld beg your precious mistress , :
Which he counts but a trifle . :
PAULINA :
Sir , my liege , :
Your eye hath too much youth in 't : not a month :
'Fore your queen died , she was more worth such gazes :
Than what you look on now . :
LEONTES :
I thought of her , :
Even in these looks I made . :
To FLORIZEL :
But your petition :
Is yet unanswer 'd . I will to your father : :
Your honour not o 'erthrown by your desires , :
I am friend to them and you : upon which errand :
I now go toward him ; therefore follow me :
And mark what way I make : come , good my lord . :
SCENE II . Before LEONTES ' palace . :
AUTOLYCUS :
Beseech you , sir , were you present at this relation ? :
First Gentleman :
I was by at the opening of the fardel , heard the old :
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it : :
whereupon , after a little amazedness , we were all :
commanded out of the chamber ; only this methought I :
heard the shepherd say , he found the child . :
AUTOLYCUS :
I would most gladly know the issue of it . :
First Gentleman :
I make a broken delivery of the business ; but the :
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were :
very notes of admiration : they seemed almost , with :
