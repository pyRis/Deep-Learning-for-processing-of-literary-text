So soon as yours could win me : so it should now , :
Were there necessity in your request , although :
'Twere needful I denied it . My affairs :
Do even drag me homeward : which to hinder :
Were in your love a whip to me ; my stay :
To you a charge and trouble : to save both , :
Farewell , our brother . :
LEONTES :
Tongue-tied , our queen ? :
speak you . :
HERMIONE :
I had thought , sir , to have held my peace until :
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay . You , sir , :
Charge him too coldly . Tell him , you are sure :
All in Bohemia 's well ; this satisfaction :
The by-gone day proclaim 'd : say this to him , :
He 's beat from his best ward . :
LEONTES :
Well said , Hermione . :
HERMIONE :
To tell , he longs to see his son , were strong : :
But let him say so then , and let him go ; :
But let him swear so , and he shall not stay , :
We 'll thwack him hence with distaffs . :
Yet of your royal presence I 'll adventure :
The borrow of a week . When at Bohemia :
You take my lord , I 'll give him my commission :
To let him there a month behind the gest :
Prefix 'd for 's parting : yet , good deed , Leontes , :
I love thee not a jar o ' the clock behind :
What lady-she her lord . You 'll stay ? :
POLIXENES :
No , madam . :
HERMIONE :
Nay , but you will ? :
POLIXENES :
I may not , verily . :
HERMIONE :
Verily ! :
You put me off with limber vows ; but I , :
Though you would seek to unsphere the :
stars with oaths , :
Should yet say ' Sir , no going . ' Verily , :
You shall not go : a lady 's ' Verily ' ' s :
As potent as a lord 's . Will you go yet ? :
Force me to keep you as a prisoner , :
Not like a guest ; so you shall pay your fees :
When you depart , and save your thanks . How say you ? :
My prisoner ? or my guest ? by your dread ' Verily , ' :
One of them you shall be . :
POLIXENES :
Your guest , then , madam : :
To be your prisoner should import offending ; :
Which is for me less easy to commit :
Than you to punish . :
HERMIONE :
Not your gaoler , then , :
But your kind hostess . Come , I 'll question you :
Of my lord 's tricks and yours when you were boys : :
You were pretty lordings then ? :
POLIXENES :
We were , fair queen , :
Two lads that thought there was no more behind :
But such a day to-morrow as to-day , :
And to be boy eternal . :
HERMIONE :
Was not my lord :
The verier wag o ' the two ? :
POLIXENES :
We were as twinn 'd lambs that did frisk i ' the sun , :
And bleat the one at the other : what we changed :
Was innocence for innocence ; we knew not :
The doctrine of ill-doing , nor dream 'd :
That any did . Had we pursued that life , :
And our weak spirits ne 'er been higher rear 'd :
With stronger blood , we should have answer 'd heaven :
Boldly ' not guilty ; ' the imposition clear 'd :
Hereditary ours . :
HERMIONE :
By this we gather :
You have tripp 'd since . :
POLIXENES :
O my most sacred lady ! :
Temptations have since then been born to 's ; for :
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl ; :
Your precious self had then not cross 'd the eyes :
Of my young play-fellow . :
HERMIONE :
Grace to boot ! :
Of this make no conclusion , lest you say :
Your queen and I are devils : yet go on ; :
