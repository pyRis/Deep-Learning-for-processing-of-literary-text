LEONTES :
Why that 's some comfort . What , Camillo there ? :
CAMILLO :
Ay , my good lord . :
LEONTES :
Go play , Mamillius ; thou 'rt an honest man . :
Exit MAMILLIUS :
Camillo , this great sir will yet stay longer . :
CAMILLO :
You had much ado to make his anchor hold : :
When you cast out , it still came home . :
LEONTES :
Didst note it ? :
CAMILLO :
He would not stay at your petitions : made :
His business more material . :
LEONTES :
Didst perceive it ? :
Aside :
They 're here with me already , whispering , rounding :
'Sicilia is a so-forth : ' ' tis far gone , :
When I shall gust it last . How came 't , Camillo , :
That he did stay ? :
CAMILLO :
At the good queen 's entreaty . :
LEONTES :
At the queen 's be 't : ' good ' should be pertinent :
But , so it is , it is not . Was this taken :
By any understanding pate but thine ? :
For thy conceit is soaking , will draw in :
More than the common blocks : not noted , is 't , :
But of the finer natures ? by some severals :
Of head-piece extraordinary ? lower messes :
Perchance are to this business purblind ? say . :
CAMILLO :
Business , my lord ! I think most understand :
Bohemia stays here longer . :
LEONTES :
Ha ! :
CAMILLO :
Stays here longer . :
LEONTES :
Ay , but why ? :
CAMILLO :
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties :
Of our most gracious mistress . :
LEONTES :
Satisfy ! :
The entreaties of your mistress ! satisfy ! :
Let that suffice . I have trusted thee , Camillo , :
With all the nearest things to my heart , as well :
My chamber-councils , wherein , priest-like , thou :
Hast cleansed my bosom , I from thee departed :
Thy penitent reform 'd : but we have been :
Deceived in thy integrity , deceived :
In that which seems so . :
CAMILLO :
Be it forbid , my lord ! :
LEONTES :
To bide upon 't , thou art not honest , or , :
If thou inclinest that way , thou art a coward , :
Which hoxes honesty behind , restraining :
From course required ; or else thou must be counted :
A servant grafted in my serious trust :
And therein negligent ; or else a fool :
That seest a game play 'd home , the rich stake drawn , :
And takest it all for jest . :
CAMILLO :
My gracious lord , :
I may be negligent , foolish and fearful ; :
In every one of these no man is free , :
But that his negligence , his folly , fear , :
Among the infinite doings of the world , :
Sometime puts forth . In your affairs , my lord , :
If ever I were wilful-negligent , :
It was my folly ; if industriously :
I play 'd the fool , it was my negligence , :
Not weighing well the end ; if ever fearful :
To do a thing , where I the issue doubted , :
Where of the execution did cry out :
Against the non-performance , ' twas a fear :
Which oft infects the wisest : these , my lord , :
Are such allow 'd infirmities that honesty :
Is never free of . But , beseech your grace , :
Be plainer with me ; let me know my trespass :
By its own visage : if I then deny it , :
'Tis none of mine . :
LEONTES :
Ha ' not you seen , Camillo , -- :
But that 's past doubt , you have , or your eye-glass :
Is thicker than a cuckold 's horn , --or heard , -- :
For to a vision so apparent rumour :
Cannot be mute , --or thought , --for cogitation :
Resides not in that man that does not think , -- :
My wife is slippery ? If thou wilt confess , :
Or else be impudently negative , :
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought , then say :
