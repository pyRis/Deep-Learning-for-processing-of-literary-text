From the dead blow of it . And you , enchantment.-- :
Worthy enough a herdsman : yea , him too , :
That makes himself , but for our honour therein , :
Unworthy thee , --if ever henceforth thou :
These rural latches to his entrance open , :
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces , :
I will devise a death as cruel for thee :
As thou art tender to 't . :
Exit :
PERDITA :
Even here undone ! :
I was not much afeard ; for once or twice :
I was about to speak and tell him plainly , :
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court :
Hides not his visage from our cottage but :
Looks on alike . Will 't please you , sir , be gone ? :
I told you what would come of this : beseech you , :
Of your own state take care : this dream of mine , -- :
Being now awake , I 'll queen it no inch farther , :
But milk my ewes and weep . :
CAMILLO :
Why , how now , father ! :
Speak ere thou diest . :
Shepherd :
I cannot speak , nor think :
Nor dare to know that which I know . O sir ! :
You have undone a man of fourscore three , :
That thought to fill his grave in quiet , yea , :
To die upon the bed my father died , :
To lie close by his honest bones : but now :
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me :
Where no priest shovels in dust . O cursed wretch , :
That knew 'st this was the prince , :
and wouldst adventure :
To mingle faith with him ! Undone ! undone ! :
If I might die within this hour , I have lived :
To die when I desire . :
Exit :
FLORIZEL :
Why look you so upon me ? :
I am but sorry , not afeard ; delay 'd , :
But nothing alter 'd : what I was , I am ; :
More straining on for plucking back , not following :
My leash unwillingly . :
CAMILLO :
Gracious my lord , :
You know your father 's temper : at this time :
He will allow no speech , which I do guess :
You do not purpose to him ; and as hardly :
Will he endure your sight as yet , I fear : :
Then , till the fury of his highness settle , :
Come not before him . :
FLORIZEL :
I not purpose it . :
I think , Camillo ? :
CAMILLO :
Even he , my lord . :
PERDITA :
How often have I told you ' twould be thus ! :
How often said , my dignity would last :
But till ' twere known ! :
FLORIZEL :
It cannot fail but by :
The violation of my faith ; and then :
Let nature crush the sides o ' the earth together :
And mar the seeds within ! Lift up thy looks : :
From my succession wipe me , father ; I :
Am heir to my affection . :
CAMILLO :
Be advised . :
FLORIZEL :
I am , and by my fancy : if my reason :
Will thereto be obedient , I have reason ; :
If not , my senses , better pleased with madness , :
Do bid it welcome . :
CAMILLO :
This is desperate , sir . :
FLORIZEL :
So call it : but it does fulfil my vow ; :
I needs must think it honesty . Camillo , :
Not for Bohemia , nor the pomp that may :
Be thereat glean 'd , for all the sun sees or :
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides :
In unknown fathoms , will I break my oath :
To this my fair beloved : therefore , I pray you , :
As you have ever been my father 's honour 'd friend , :
When he shall miss me , --as , in faith , I mean not :
To see him any more , --cast your good counsels :
Upon his passion ; let myself and fortune :
Tug for the time to come . This you may know :
