LUCIUS : Uncle Marcus , since it is my father 's mind That I repair to Rome , I am content .
First Goth : And ours with thine , befall what fortune will .
LUCIUS : Good uncle , take you in this barbarous Moor , This ravenous tiger , this accursed devil ; Let him receive no sustenance , fetter him Till he be brought unto the empress ' face , For testimony of her foul proceedings : And see the ambush of our friends be strong ; I fear the emperor means no good to us .
AARON : Some devil whisper curses in mine ear , And prompt me , that my tongue may utter forth The venomous malice of my swelling heart !
LUCIUS : Away , inhuman dog ! unhallow 'd slave ! Sirs , help our uncle to convey him in . The trumpets show the emperor is at hand . Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA , with AEMILIUS , Tribunes , Senators , and others
SATURNINUS : What , hath the firmament more suns than one ?
LUCIUS : What boots it thee to call thyself a sun ?
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Rome 's emperor , and nephew , break the parle ; These quarrels must be quietly debated . The feast is ready , which the careful Titus Hath ordain 'd to an honourable end , For peace , for love , for league , and good to Rome : Please you , therefore , draw nigh , and take your places .
SATURNINUS : Marcus , we will . Hautboys sound . The Company sit down at table Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook , LAVINIA veiled , Young LUCIUS , and others . TITUS places the dishes on the table
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Welcome , my gracious lord ; welcome , dread queen ; Welcome , ye warlike Goths ; welcome , Lucius ; And welcome , all : although the cheer be poor , ' Twill fill your stomachs ; please you eat of it .
SATURNINUS : Why art thou thus attired , Andronicus ?
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Because I would be sure to have all well , To entertain your highness and your empress .
TAMORA : We are beholding to you , good Andronicus .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : An if your highness knew my heart , you were . My lord the emperor , resolve me this : Was it well done of rash Virginius To slay his daughter with his own right hand , Because she was enforced , stain 'd , and deflower 'd ?
SATURNINUS : It was , Andronicus .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Your reason , mighty lord ?
SATURNINUS : Because the girl should not survive her shame , And by her presence still renew his sorrows .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : A reason mighty , strong , and effectual ; A pattern , precedent , and lively warrant , For me , most wretched , to perform the like . Die , die , Lavinia , and thy shame with thee ; Kills LAVINIA And , with thy shame , thy father 's sorrow die !
SATURNINUS : What hast thou done , unnatural and unkind ?
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Kill 'd her , for whom my tears have made me blind . I am as woful as Virginius was , And have a thousand times more cause than he To do this outrage : and it now is done .
SATURNINUS : What , was she ravish 'd ? tell who did the deed .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Will 't please you eat ? will 't please your highness feed ?
TAMORA : Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus ?
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Not I ; ' twas Chiron and Demetrius : They ravish 'd her , and cut away her tongue ; And they , ' twas they , that did her all this wrong .
SATURNINUS : Go fetch them hither to us presently .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Why , there they are both , baked in that pie ; Whereof their mother daintily hath fed , Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred . ' Tis true , ' tis true ; witness my knife 's sharp point . Kills TAMORA
SATURNINUS : Die , frantic wretch , for this accursed deed ! Kills TITUS
