TAMORA : And here , in sight of heaven , to Rome I swear , If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths , She will a handmaid be to his desires , A loving nurse , a mother to his youth .
SATURNINUS : Ascend , fair queen , Pantheon . Lords , accompany Your noble emperor and his lovely bride , Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine , Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered : There shall we consummate our spousal rites .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : I am not bid to wait upon this bride . Titus , when wert thou wont to walk alone , Dishonour 'd thus , and challenged of wrongs ? Re-enter MARCUS , LUCIUS , QUINTUS , and MARTIUS
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : O Titus , see , O , see what thou hast done ! In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : No , foolish tribune , no ; no son of mine , Nor thou , nor these , confederates in the deed That hath dishonour 'd all our family ; Unworthy brother , and unworthy sons !
LUCIUS : But let us give him burial , as becomes ; Give Mutius burial with our brethren .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Traitors , away ! he rests not in this tomb : This monument five hundred years hath stood , Which I have sumptuously re-edified : Here none but soldiers and Rome 's servitors Repose in fame ; none basely slain in brawls : Bury him where you can ; he comes not here .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : My lord , this is impiety in you : My nephew Mutius ' deeds do plead for him He must be buried with his brethren .
QUINTUS MARTIUS : And shall , or him we will accompany .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : ' And shall ! ' what villain was it that spake that word ?
QUINTUS : He that would vouch it in any place but here .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : What , would you bury him in my despite ?
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : No , noble Titus , but entreat of thee To pardon Mutius and to bury him .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Marcus , even thou hast struck upon my crest , And , with these boys , mine honour thou hast wounded : My foes I do repute you every one ; So , trouble me no more , but get you gone .
MARTIUS : He is not with himself ; let us withdraw .
QUINTUS : Not I , till Mutius ' bones be buried . MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Brother , for in that name doth nature plead , --
QUINTUS : Father , and in that name doth nature speak , --
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Speak thou no more , if all the rest will speed .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Renowned Titus , more than half my soul , --
LUCIUS : Dear father , soul and substance of us all , --
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter His noble nephew here in virtue 's nest , That died in honour and Lavinia 's cause . Thou art a Roman ; be not barbarous : The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax That slew himself ; and wise Laertes ' son Did graciously plead for his funerals : Let not young Mutius , then , that was thy joy Be barr 'd his entrance here .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Rise , Marcus , rise . The dismall 'st day is this that e 'er I saw , To be dishonour 'd by my sons in Rome ! Well , bury him , and bury me the next . MUTIUS is put into the tomb
LUCIUS : There lie thy bones , sweet Mutius , with thy friends , Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb .
All : No man shed tears for noble Mutius ; He lives in fame that died in virtue 's cause .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : My lord , to step out of these dreary dumps , How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome ?
