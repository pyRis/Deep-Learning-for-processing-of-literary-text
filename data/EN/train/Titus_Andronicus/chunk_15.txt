TITUS ANDRONICUS : O gracious emperor ! O gentle Aaron ! Did ever raven sing so like a lark , That gives sweet tidings of the sun 's uprise ? With all my heart , I 'll send the emperor My hand : Good Aaron , wilt thou help to chop it off ?
LUCIUS : Stay , father ! for that noble hand of thine , That hath thrown down so many enemies , Shall not be sent : my hand will serve the turn : My youth can better spare my blood than you ; And therefore mine shall save my brothers ' lives .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Which of your hands hath not defended Rome , And rear 'd aloft the bloody battle-axe , Writing destruction on the enemy 's castle ? O , none of both but are of high desert : My hand hath been but idle ; let it serve To ransom my two nephews from their death ; Then have I kept it to a worthy end .
AARON : Nay , come , agree whose hand shall go along , For fear they die before their pardon come .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : My hand shall go .
LUCIUS : By heaven , it shall not go !
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Sirs , strive no more : such wither 'd herbs as these Are meet for plucking up , and therefore mine .
LUCIUS : Sweet father , if I shall be thought thy son , Let me redeem my brothers both from death .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : And , for our father 's sake and mother 's care , Now let me show a brother 's love to thee .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Agree between you ; I will spare my hand .
LUCIUS : Then I 'll go fetch an axe .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : But I will use the axe .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Come hither , Aaron ; I 'll deceive them both : Lend me thy hand , and I will give thee mine .
AARON : If that be call 'd deceit , I will be honest , And never , whilst I live , deceive men so : But I 'll deceive you in another sort , And that you 'll say , ere half an hour pass . Cuts off TITUS 's hand Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Now stay your strife : what shall be is dispatch 'd . Good Aaron , give his majesty my hand : Tell him it was a hand that warded him From thousand dangers ; bid him bury it More hath it merited ; that let it have . As for my sons , say I account of them As jewels purchased at an easy price ; And yet dear too , because I bought mine own .
AARON : I go , Andronicus : and for thy hand Look by and by to have thy sons with thee . Aside Their heads , I mean . O , how this villany Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it ! Let fools do good , and fair men call for grace . Aaron will have his soul black like his face . Exit
TITUS ANDRONICUS : O , here I lift this one hand up to heaven , And bow this feeble ruin to the earth : If any power pities wretched tears , To that I call ! To LAVINIA What , wilt thou kneel with me ? Do , then , dear heart ; for heaven shall hear our prayers ; Or with our sighs we 'll breathe the welkin dim , And stain the sun with fog , as sometime clouds When they do hug him in their melting bosoms .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : O brother , speak with possibilities , And do not break into these deep extremes .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Is not my sorrow deep , having no bottom ? Then be my passions bottomless with them .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : But yet let reason govern thy lament .
