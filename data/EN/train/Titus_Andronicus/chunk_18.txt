MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Stand by me , Lucius ; do not fear thine aunt .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : She loves thee , boy , too well to do thee harm .
Young LUCIUS : Ay , when my father was in Rome she did .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : What means my niece Lavinia by these signs ?
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Fear her not , Lucius : somewhat doth she mean : See , Lucius , see how much she makes of thee : Somewhither would she have thee go with her . Ah , boy , Cornelia never with more care Read to her sons than she hath read to thee Sweet poetry and Tully 's Orator .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus ?
Young LUCIUS : My lord , I know not , I , nor can I guess , Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her : For I have heard my grandsire say full oft , Extremity of griefs would make men mad ; And I have read that Hecuba of Troy Ran mad through sorrow : that made me to fear ; Although , my lord , I know my noble aunt Loves me as dear as e 'er my mother did , And would not , but in fury , fright my youth : Which made me down to throw my books , and fly-- Causeless , perhaps . But pardon me , sweet aunt : And , madam , if my uncle Marcus go , I will most willingly attend your ladyship .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Lucius , I will . LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall
TITUS ANDRONICUS : How now , Lavinia ! Marcus , what means this ? Some book there is that she desires to see . Which is it , girl , of these ? Open them , boy . But thou art deeper read , and better skill 'd Come , and take choice of all my library , And so beguile thy sorrow , till the heavens Reveal the damn 'd contriver of this deed . Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus ?
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : I think she means that there was more than one Confederate in the fact : ay , more there was ; Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Lucius , what book is that she tosseth so ?
Young LUCIUS : Grandsire , ' tis Ovid 's Metamorphoses ; My mother gave it me .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : For love of her that 's gone , Perhaps she cull 'd it from among the rest .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Soft ! see how busily she turns the leaves ! Helping her What would she find ? Lavinia , shall I read ? This is the tragic tale of Philomel , And treats of Tereus ' treason and his rape : And rape , I fear , was root of thine annoy .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : See , brother , see ; note how she quotes the leaves .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Lavinia , wert thou thus surprised , sweet girl , Ravish 'd and wrong 'd , as Philomela was , Forced in the ruthless , vast , and gloomy woods ? See , see ! Ay , such a place there is , where we did hunt-- O , had we never , never hunted there ! -- Pattern 'd by that the poet here describes , By nature made for murders and for rapes .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : O , why should nature build so foul a den , Unless the gods delight in tragedies ?
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Give signs , sweet girl , for here are none but friends , What Roman lord it was durst do the deed : Or slunk not Saturnine , as Tarquin erst , That left the camp to sin in Lucrece ' bed ?
