MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Kinsmen , shoot all your shafts into the court : We will afflict the emperor in his pride .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Now , masters , draw . They shoot O , well said , Lucius ! Good boy , in Virgo 's lap ; give it Pallas .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : My lord , I aim a mile beyond the moon ; Your letter is with Jupiter by this .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Ha , ha ! Publius , Publius , what hast thou done ? See , see , thou hast shot off one of Taurus ' horns .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : This was the sport , my lord : when Publius shot , The Bull , being gall 'd , gave Aries such a knock That down fell both the Ram 's horns in the court ; And who should find them but the empress ' villain ? She laugh 'd , and told the Moor he should not choose But give them to his master for a present .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Why , there it goes : God give his lordship joy ! Enter a Clown , with a basket , and two pigeons in it News , news from heaven ! Marcus , the post is come . Sirrah , what tidings ? have you any letters ? Shall I have justice ? what says Jupiter ?
Clown : O , the gibbet-maker ! he says that he hath taken them down again , for the man must not be hanged till the next week .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : But what says Jupiter , I ask thee ?
Clown : Alas , sir , I know not Jupiter ; I never drank with him in all my life .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Why , villain , art not thou the carrier ?
Clown : Ay , of my pigeons , sir ; nothing else .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Why , didst thou not come from heaven ?
Clown : From heaven ! alas , sir , I never came there God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days . Why , I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs , to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial 's men .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : Why , sir , that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration ; and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Tell me , can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace ?
Clown : Nay , truly , sir , I could never say grace in all my life .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Sirrah , come hither : make no more ado , But give your pigeons to the emperor : By me thou shalt have justice at his hands . Hold , hold ; meanwhile here 's money for thy charges . Give me pen and ink . Sirrah , can you with a grace deliver a supplication ?
Clown : Ay , sir .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Then here is a supplication for you . And when you come to him , at the first approach you must kneel , then kiss his foot , then deliver up your pigeons , and then look for your reward . I 'll be at hand , sir ; see you do it bravely .
Clown : I warrant you , sir , let me alone .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Sirrah , hast thou a knife ? come , let me see it . Here , Marcus , fold it in the oration ; For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant . And when thou hast given it the emperor , Knock at my door , and tell me what he says .
Clown : God be with you , sir ; I will .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Come , Marcus , let us go . Publius , follow me . Enter SATURNINUS , TAMORA , DEMETRIUS , CHIRON , Lords , and others ; SATURNINUS with the arrows in his hand that TITUS shot
