TITUS ANDRONICUS : Nay , nay , let Rape and Murder stay with me ; Or else I 'll call my brother back again , And cleave to no revenge but Lucius .
TAMORA : What say you , boys ? will you bide with him , Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor How I have govern 'd our determined jest ? Yield to his humour , smooth and speak him fair , And tarry with him till I turn again .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : I know them all , though they suppose me mad , And will o 'erreach them in their own devices : A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam !
DEMETRIUS : Madam , depart at pleasure ; leave us here .
TAMORA : Farewell , Andronicus : Revenge now goes To lay a complot to betray thy foes .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : I know thou dost ; and , sweet Revenge , farewell . Exit TAMORA
CHIRON : Tell us , old man , how shall we be employ 'd ?
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Tut , I have work enough for you to do . Publius , come hither , Caius , and Valentine ! Enter PUBLIUS and others
PUBLIUS : What is your will ?
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Know you these two ?
PUBLIUS : The empress ' sons , I take them , Chiron and Demetrius .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Fie , Publius , fie ! thou art too much deceived ; The one is Murder , Rape is the other 's name ; And therefore bind them , gentle Publius . Caius and Valentine , lay hands on them . Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour , And now I find it ; therefore bind them sure , And stop their mouths , if they begin to cry . Exit PUBLIUS , & c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS
CHIRON : Villains , forbear ! we are the empress ' sons .
PUBLIUS : And therefore do we what we are commanded . Stop close their mouths , let them not speak a word . Is he sure bound ? look that you bind them fast . Re-enter TITUS , with LAVINIA ; he bearing a knife , and she a basin
