SATURNINUS : Thanks , noble Titus , father of my life ! How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record , and when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts , Romans , forget your fealty to me .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Now , madam , are you prisoner to an emperor ; To him that , for your honour and your state , Will use you nobly and your followers .
SATURNINUS : A goodly lady , trust me ; of the hue That I would choose , were I to choose anew . Clear up , fair queen , that cloudy countenance : Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer , Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome : Princely shall be thy usage every way . Rest on my word , and let not discontent Daunt all your hopes : madam , he comforts you Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths . Lavinia , you are not displeased with this ?
LAVINIA : Not I , my lord ; sith true nobility Warrants these words in princely courtesy .
SATURNINUS : Thanks , sweet Lavinia . Romans , let us go ; Ransomless here we set our prisoners free : Proclaim our honours , lords , with trump and drum . Flourish . SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show
BASSIANUS : Lord Titus , by your leave , this maid is mine . Seizing LAVINIA
TITUS ANDRONICUS : How , sir ! are you in earnest then , my lord ?
BASSIANUS : Ay , noble Titus ; and resolved withal To do myself this reason and this right .
MARCUS ANDRONICUS : ' Suum cuique ' is our Roman justice : This prince in justice seizeth but his own .
LUCIUS : And that he will , and shall , if Lucius live .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Traitors , avaunt ! Where is the emperor 's guard ? Treason , my lord ! Lavinia is surprised !
SATURNINUS : Surprised ! by whom ?
BASSIANUS : By him that justly may Bear his betroth 'd from all the world away .
MUTIUS : Brothers , help to convey her hence away , And with my sword I 'll keep this door safe .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Follow , my lord , and I 'll soon bring her back .
MUTIUS : My lord , you pass not here .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : What , villain boy ! Barr 'st me my way in Rome ? Stabbing MUTIUS
MUTIUS : Help , Lucius , help ! Dies During the fray , SATURNINUS , TAMORA , DEMETRIUS , CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter , above Re-enter LUCIUS
LUCIUS : My lord , you are unjust , and , more than so , In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Nor thou , nor he , are any sons of mine ; My sons would never so dishonour me : Traitor , restore Lavinia to the emperor .
LUCIUS : Dead , if you will ; but not to be his wife , That is another 's lawful promised love . Exit
SATURNINUS : No , Titus , no ; the emperor needs her not , Nor her , nor thee , nor any of thy stock : I 'll trust , by leisure , him that mocks me once ; Thee never , nor thy traitorous haughty sons , Confederates all thus to dishonour me . Was there none else in Rome to make a stale , But Saturnine ? Full well , Andronicus , Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine , That said 'st I begg 'd the empire at thy hands .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : O monstrous ! what reproachful words are these ?
SATURNINUS : But go thy ways ; go , give that changing piece To him that flourish 'd for her with his sword A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy ; One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons , To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : These words are razors to my wounded heart .
