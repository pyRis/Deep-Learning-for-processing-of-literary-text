AARON : My gracious lord , here is the bag of gold .
SATURNINUS : Two of thy whelps , fell curs of bloody kind , Have here bereft my brother of his life . Sirs , drag them from the pit unto the prison : There let them bide until we have devised Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them .
TAMORA : What , are they in this pit ? O wondrous thing ! How easily murder is discovered !
TITUS ANDRONICUS : High emperor , upon my feeble knee I beg this boon , with tears not lightly shed , That this fell fault of my accursed sons , Accursed if the fault be proved in them , --
SATURNINUS : If it be proved ! you see it is apparent . Who found this letter ? Tamora , was it you ?
TAMORA : Andronicus himself did take it up .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : I did , my lord : yet let me be their bail ; For , by my father 's reverend tomb , I vow They shall be ready at your highness ' will To answer their suspicion with their lives .
SATURNINUS : Thou shalt not bail them : see thou follow me . Some bring the murder 'd body , some the murderers : Let them not speak a word ; the guilt is plain ; For , by my soul , were there worse end than death , That end upon them should be executed .
TAMORA : Andronicus , I will entreat the king ; Fear not thy sons ; they shall do well enough .
TITUS ANDRONICUS : Come , Lucius , come ; stay not to talk with them . Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA , ravished ; her hands cut off , and her tongue cut out
DEMETRIUS : So , now go tell , an if thy tongue can speak , Who ' twas that cut thy tongue and ravish 'd thee .
CHIRON : Write down thy mind , bewray thy meaning so , An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe .
DEMETRIUS : See , how with signs and tokens she can scrowl .
CHIRON : Go home , call for sweet water , wash thy hands .
DEMETRIUS : She hath no tongue to call , nor hands to wash ; And so let 's leave her to her silent walks .
CHIRON : An ' twere my case , I should go hang myself .
DEMETRIUS : If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord . Enter MARCUS
