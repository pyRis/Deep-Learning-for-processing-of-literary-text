SHALLOW : Not a whit .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Yes , py 'r lady ; if he has a quarter of your coat , there is but three skirts for yourself , in my simple conjectures : but that is all one .

","Justice Shallow, Master Slender, and Sir Hugh Evans enter, discussing Shallow's anger at Sir John Falstaff. Evans changes the topic to the young Anne Page, whom he would like to see Slender marry. They arrive at Master Page's door,"
"SHALLOW : Master Page , I am glad to see you : much good do it your good heart ! I wished your venison better ; it was ill killed . How doth good Mistress Page ? --and I thank you always with my heart , la ! with my heart .
PAGE : Sir , I thank you .

PAGE : Sir , he is within ; and I would I could do a good office between you .
SIR HUGH EVANS : It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak .
SHALLOW : He hath wronged me , Master Page .
PAGE : Sir , he doth in some sort confess it .
SHALLOW : If it be confessed , it is not redress 'd : is not that so , Master Page ? He hath wronged me ; indeed he hath , at a word , he hath , believe me : Robert Shallow , esquire , saith , he is wronged .
PAGE : Here comes Sir John . Enter FALSTAFF , BARDOLPH , NYM , and PISTOL
FALSTAFF : Now , Master Shallow , you 'll complain of me to the king ?
SHALLOW : Knight , you have beaten my men , killed my deer , and broke open my lodge .
FALSTAFF : But not kissed your keeper 's daughter ?
SHALLOW : Tut , a pin ! this shall be answered .
FALSTAFF : I will answer it straight ; I have done all this . That is now answered .
SHALLOW : The council shall know this .
FALSTAFF : ' Twere better for you if it were known in counsel : you 'll be laughed at .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Pauca verba , Sir John ; goot worts .
FALSTAFF : Good worts ! good cabbage . Slender , I broke your head : what matter have you against me ?
SLENDER : Marry , sir , I have matter in my head against you ; and against your cony-catching rascals , Bardolph , Nym , and Pistol .
BARDOLPH : You Banbury cheese !
SLENDER : Ay , it is no matter .
PISTOL : How now , Mephostophilus !
SLENDER : Ay , it is no matter .
NYM : Slice , I say ! pauca , pauca : slice ! that 's my humour .
SLENDER : Where 's Simple , my man ? Can you tell , cousin ?
SIR HUGH EVANS : Peace , I pray you . Now let us understand . There is three umpires in this matter , as I understand ; that is , Master Page , fidelicet Master Page ; and there is myself , fidelicet myself ; and the three party is , lastly and finally , mine host of the Garter .
PAGE : We three , to hear it and end it between them .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Fery goot : I will make a prief of it in my note- book ; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can .
FALSTAFF : Pistol !
PISTOL : He hears with ears .
SIR HUGH EVANS : The tevil and his tam ! what phrase is this , ' He hears with ear ' ? why , it is affectations .
FALSTAFF : Pistol , did you pick Master Slender 's purse ?
SLENDER : Ay , by these gloves , did he , or I would I might never come in mine own great chamber again else , of seven groats in mill-sixpences , and two Edward shovel-boards , that cost me two shilling and two pence apiece of Yead Miller , by these gloves .
",Shallow confronts Falstaff and his entourage. Falstaff admits to the swindle.
"SIR HUGH EVANS : No ; it is false , if it is a pick-purse .
PISTOL : Ha , thou mountain-foreigner ! Sir John and Master mine , I combat challenge of this latten bilbo . Word of denial in thy labras here ! Word of denial : froth and scum , thou liest !
SLENDER : By these gloves , then , ' twas he .
NYM : Be avised , sir , and pass good humours : I will say ' marry trap ' with you , if you run the nuthook 's humour on me ; that is the very note of it .
SLENDER : By this hat , then , he in the red face had it ; for though I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk , yet I am not altogether an ass .
FALSTAFF : What say you , Scarlet and John ?
BARDOLPH : Why , sir , for my part I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five sentences .
SIR HUGH EVANS : It is his five senses : fie , what the ignorance is !
BARDOLPH : And being fap , sir , was , as they say , cashiered ; and so conclusions passed the careires .
SLENDER : Ay , you spake in Latin then too ; but ' tis no matter : I 'll ne 'er be drunk whilst I live again , but in honest , civil , godly company , for this trick : if I be drunk , I 'll be drunk with those that have the fear of God , and not with drunken knaves .
SIR HUGH EVANS : So Got udge me , that is a virtuous mind .
FALSTAFF : You hear all these matters denied , gentlemen ; you hear it . Enter ANNE PAGE , with wine ; MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE , following
PAGE : Nay , daughter , carry the wine in ; we 'll drink within . Exit ANNE PAGE
SLENDER : O heaven ! this is Mistress Anne Page .
PAGE : How now , Mistress Ford !
FALSTAFF : Mistress Ford , by my troth , you are very well met : by your leave , good mistress . Kisses her
PAGE : Wife , bid these gentlemen welcome . Come , we have a hot venison pasty to dinner : come , gentlemen , I hope we shall drink down all unkindness .
SLENDER : I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here . Enter SIMPLE How now , Simple ! where have you been ? I must wait on myself , must I ? You have not the Book of Riddles about you , have you ?
SIMPLE : Book of Riddles ! why , did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last , a fortnight afore Michaelmas ?
SHALLOW : Come , coz ; come , coz ; we stay for you . A word with you , coz ; marry , this , coz : there is , as ' twere , a tender , a kind of tender , made afar off by Sir Hugh here . Do you understand me ?
SLENDER : Ay , sir , you shall find me reasonable ; if it be so , I shall do that that is reason .
SHALLOW : Nay , but understand me .
SLENDER : So I do , sir .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Give ear to his motions , Master Slender : I will description the matter to you , if you be capacity of it .
SLENDER : Nay , I will do as my cousin Shallow says : I pray you , pardon me ; he 's a justice of peace in his country , simple though I stand here .
SIR HUGH EVANS : But that is not the question : the question is concerning your marriage .
SHALLOW : Ay , there 's the point , sir .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Marry , is it ; the very point of it ; to Mistress Anne Page .
SLENDER : Why , if it be so , I will marry her upon any reasonable demands .
","Evans suggests they forget their grievances and that Slender court Anne Page, master Page's daughter."
"SHALLOW : Cousin Abraham Slender , can you love her ?
SLENDER : I hope , sir , I will do as it shall become one that would do reason .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Nay , Got 's lords and his ladies ! you must speak possitable , if you can carry her your desires towards her .
SHALLOW : That you must . Will you , upon good dowry , marry her ?
SLENDER : I will do a greater thing than that , upon your request , cousin , in any reason .
SHALLOW : Nay , conceive me , conceive me , sweet coz : what I do is to pleasure you , coz . Can you love the maid ?
SLENDER : I will marry her , sir , at your request : but if there be no great love in the beginning , yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance , when we are married and have more occasion to know one another ; I hope , upon familiarity will grow more contempt : but if you say , ' Marry her , ' I will marry her ; that I am freely dissolved , and dissolutely .
SIR HUGH EVANS : It is a fery discretion answer ; save the fall is in the ort ' dissolutely : ' the ort is , according to our meaning , ' resolutely : ' his meaning is good .
SHALLOW : Ay , I think my cousin meant well .
SLENDER : Ay , or else I would I might be hanged , la !
SHALLOW : Here comes fair Mistress Anne . Re-enter ANNE PAGE Would I were young for your sake , Mistress Anne !
ANNE PAGE : The dinner is on the table ; my father desires your worships ' company .
SHALLOW : I will wait on him , fair Mistress Anne .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Od 's plessed will ! I will not be absence at the grace .
ANNE PAGE : Will 't please your worship to come in , sir ?
SLENDER : No , I thank you , forsooth , heartily ; I am very well .
ANNE PAGE : The dinner attends you , sir .
SLENDER : I am not a-hungry , I thank you , forsooth . Go , sirrah , for all you are my man , go wait upon my cousin Shallow . Exit SIMPLE A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his friend for a man . I keep but three men and a boy yet , till my mother be dead : but what though ? Yet I live like a poor gentleman born .
ANNE PAGE : I may not go in without your worship : they will not sit till you come .
SLENDER : I ' faith , I 'll eat nothing ; I thank you as much as though I did .
ANNE PAGE : I pray you , sir , walk in .
SLENDER : I had rather walk here , I thank you . I bruised my shin th ' other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence ; three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes ; and , by my troth , I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since . Why do your dogs bark so ? be there bears i ' the town ?
ANNE PAGE : I think there are , sir ; I heard them talked of .
SLENDER : I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England . You are afraid , if you see the bear loose , are you not ?
ANNE PAGE : Ay , indeed , sir .
SLENDER : That 's meat and drink to me , now . I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times , and have taken him by the chain ; but , I warrant you , the women have so cried and shrieked at it , that it passed : but women , indeed , cannot abide ' em ; they are very ill-favored rough things . Re-enter PAGE
PAGE : Come , gentle Master Slender , come ; we stay for you .
SLENDER : I 'll eat nothing , I thank you , sir .
PAGE : By cock and pie , you shall not choose , sir ! come , come .
","Slender drifts around outside, trying unsuccessfully to converse with Anne Page until he goes inside."
"PAGE : Come on , sir .
SLENDER : Mistress Anne , yourself shall go first .
ANNE PAGE : Not I , sir ; pray you , keep on .
SLENDER : I 'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome . You do yourself wrong , indeed , la ! Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE
SIR HUGH EVANS : Go your ways , and ask of Doctor Caius ' house which is the way : and there dwells one Mistress Quickly , which is in the manner of his nurse , or his dry nurse , or his cook , or his laundry , his washer , and his wringer .
SIMPLE : Well , sir .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Nay , it is petter yet . Give her this letter ; for it is a ' oman that altogether 's acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page : and the letter is , to desire and require her to solicit your master 's desires to Mistress Anne Page . I pray you , be gone : I will make an end of my dinner ; there 's pippins and cheese to come . Enter FALSTAFF , Host , BARDOLPH , NYM , PISTOL , and ROBIN
FALSTAFF : Mine host of the Garter !
Host : What says my bully-rook ? speak scholarly and wisely .
FALSTAFF : Truly , mine host , I must turn away some of my followers .
Host : Discard , bully Hercules ; cashier : let them wag ; trot , trot .
FALSTAFF : I sit at ten pounds a week .
Host : Thou 'rt an emperor , Caesar , Keisar , and Pheezar . I will entertain Bardolph ; he shall draw , he shall tap : said I well , bully Hector ?
FALSTAFF : Do so , good mine host .
Host : I have spoke ; let him follow . To BARDOLPH Let me see thee froth and lime : I am at a word ; follow . Exit
FALSTAFF : Bardolph , follow him . A tapster is a good trade : an old cloak makes a new jerkin ; a withered serving-man a fresh tapster . Go ; adieu .
BARDOLPH : It is a life that I have desired : I will thrive .
PISTOL : O base Hungarian wight ! wilt thou the spigot wield ? Exit BARDOLPH
NYM : He was gotten in drink : is not the humour conceited ?
FALSTAFF : I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox : his thefts were too open ; his filching was like an unskilful singer ; he kept not time .
NYM : The good humour is to steal at a minute 's rest .
PISTOL : ' Convey , ' the wise it call . ' Steal ! ' foh ! a fico for the phrase !
FALSTAFF : Well , sirs , I am almost out at heels .
PISTOL : Why , then , let kibes ensue .
FALSTAFF : There is no remedy ; I must cony-catch ; I must shift .
PISTOL : Young ravens must have food .
FALSTAFF : Which of you know Ford of this town ?
PISTOL : I ken the wight : he is of substance good .
FALSTAFF : My honest lads , I will tell you what I am about .
PISTOL : Two yards , and more .
FALSTAFF : No quips now , Pistol ! Indeed , I am in the waist two yards about ; but I am now about no waste ; I am about thrift . Briefly , I do mean to make love to Ford 's wife : I spy entertainment in her ; she discourses , she carves , she gives the leer of invitation : I can construe the action of her familiar style ; and the hardest voice of her behavior , to be Englished rightly , is , ' I am Sir John Falstaff 's . ' 
PISTOL : He hath studied her will , and translated her will , out of honesty into English .
NYM : The anchor is deep : will that humour pass ?
FALSTAFF : Now , the report goes she has all the rule of her husband 's purse : he hath a legion of angels .
PISTOL : As many devils entertain ; and ' To her , boy , ' say I.
NYM : The humour rises ; it is good : humour me the angels .
","Falstaff and his entourage settle in at the Garter Inn, where Falstaff reveals his plan to seduce Mistress Page and Mistress Ford, both of whom have control over their husband's money. Convinced that both women are enamored of him, he writes identical love letters to Mistress Page and Mistress Ford. Falstaff wants to send Pistol and Nym to deliver letters to the women."
"PISTOL : Then did the sun on dunghill shine .
NYM : I thank thee for that humour .
FALSTAFF : O , she did so course o 'er my exteriors with such a greedy intention , that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass ! Here 's another letter to her : she bears the purse too ; she is a region in Guiana , all gold and bounty . I will be cheater to them both , and they shall be exchequers to me ; they shall be my East and West Indies , and I will trade to them both . Go bear thou this letter to Mistress Page ; and thou this to Mistress Ford : we will thrive , lads , we will thrive .
PISTOL : Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become , And by my side wear steel ? then , Lucifer take all !
NYM : I will run no base humour : here , take the humour-letter : I will keep the havior of reputation .
FALSTAFF : Hold , sirrah , bear you these letters tightly ; Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores . Rogues , hence , avaunt ! vanish like hailstones , go ; Trudge , plod away o ' the hoof ; seek shelter , pack ! Falstaff will learn the humour of the age , French thrift , you rogues ; myself and skirted page .
PISTOL : Let vultures gripe thy guts ! for gourd and fullam holds , And high and low beguiles the rich and poor : Tester I 'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack , Base Phrygian Turk !
NYM : I have operations which be humours of revenge .
PISTOL : Wilt thou revenge ?
NYM : By welkin and her star !
PISTOL : With wit or steel ?
NYM : With both the humours , I : I will discuss the humour of this love to Page .
PISTOL : And I to Ford shall eke unfold How Falstaff , varlet vile , His dove will prove , his gold will hold , And his soft couch defile .
NYM : My humour shall not cool : I will incense Page to deal with poison ; I will possess him with yellowness , for the revolt of mine is dangerous : that is my true humour .
PISTOL : Thou art the Mars of malecontents : I second thee ; troop on . Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY , SIMPLE , and RUGBY
MISTRESS QUICKLY : What , John Rugby ! I pray thee , go to the casement , and see if you can see my master , Master Doctor Caius , coming . If he do , i ' faith , and find any body in the house , here will be an old abusing of God 's patience and the king 's English .
RUGBY : I 'll go watch .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Go ; and we 'll have a posset for 't soon at night , in faith , at the latter end of a sea-coal fire . Exit RUGBY An honest , willing , kind fellow , as ever servant shall come in house withal , and , I warrant you , no tell-tale nor no breed-bate : his worst fault is , that he is given to prayer ; he is something peevish that way : but nobody but has his fault ; but let that pass . Peter Simple , you say your name is ?
SIMPLE : Ay , for fault of a better .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : And Master Slender 's your master ?
SIMPLE : Ay , forsooth .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Does he not wear a great round beard , like a glover 's paring-knife ?
SIMPLE : No , forsooth : he hath but a little wee face , with a little yellow beard , a Cain-coloured beard .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : A softly-sprighted man , is he not ?
SIMPLE : Ay , forsooth : but he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head ; he hath fought with a warrener .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : How say you ? O , I should remember him : does he not hold up his head , as it were , and strut in his gait ?
SIMPLE : Yes , indeed , does he .
","Pistol and Nym refuses to deliver the letter. Instead they plot to stymie Falstaff's plans by telling Page and Ford of his intentions.  Mistress Quickly talks to Slender's servant Simple, sent by Evans, and agrees that she will consent to speak positively of Slender to Anne Page."
"RUGBY : Out , alas ! here comes my master .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : We shall all be shent . Run in here , good young man ; go into this closet : he will not stay long . Shuts SIMPLE in the closet What , John Rugby ! John ! what , John , I say ! Go , John , go inquire for my master ; I doubt he be not well , that he comes not home . Singing And down , down , adown-a , & c . Enter DOCTOR CAIUS
DOCTOR CAIUS : Vat is you sing ? I do not like des toys . Pray you , go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert , a box , a green-a box : do intend vat I speak ? a green-a box .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Ay , forsooth ; I 'll fetch it you . Aside I am glad he went not in himself : if he had found the young man , he would have been horn-mad .
DOCTOR CAIUS : Fe , fe , fe , fe ! ma foi , il fait fort chaud . Je m 'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Is it this , sir ?
DOCTOR CAIUS : Oui ; mette le au mon pocket : depeche , quickly . Vere is dat knave Rugby ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : What , John Rugby ! John !
RUGBY : Here , sir !
DOCTOR CAIUS : You are John Rugby , and you are Jack Rugby . Come , take-a your rapier , and come after my heel to the court .

MISTRESS QUICKLY : The young man is an honest man .
DOCTOR CAIUS : What shall de honest man do in my closet ? dere is no honest man dat shall come in my closet .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : I beseech you , be not so phlegmatic . Hear the truth of it : he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh .
DOCTOR CAIUS : Vell .
SIMPLE : Ay , forsooth ; to desire her to--
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Peace , I pray you .
DOCTOR CAIUS : Peace-a your tongue . Speak-a your tale .
SIMPLE : To desire this honest gentlewoman , your maid , to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master in the way of marriage .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : This is all , indeed , la ! but I 'll ne 'er put my finger in the fire , and need not .
DOCTOR CAIUS : Sir Hugh send-a you ? Rugby , baille me some paper . Tarry you a little-a while . Writes
MISTRESS QUICKLY : I am glad he is so quiet : if he had been thoroughly moved , you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy . But notwithstanding , man , I 'll do you your master what good I can : and the very yea and the no is , the French doctor , my master , --I may call him my master , look you , for I keep his house ; and I wash , wring , brew , bake , scour , dress meat and drink , make the beds and do all myself , --

MISTRESS QUICKLY : Are you avised o ' that ? you shall find it a great charge : and to be up early and down late ; but notwithstanding , --to tell you in your ear ; I would have no words of it , --my master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page : but notwithstanding that , I know Anne 's mind , --that 's neither here nor there .
","Mistress Quickly’s master, Doctor Caius, enters and encounters Simple. When he hears about his errand, he becomes angry and drafts a letter to Evans. Caius too is in love with Anne Page and blames Evans for encouraging Slender; hence he challenges him to a duel."
"MISTRESS QUICKLY : Alas , he speaks but for his friend .
DOCTOR CAIUS : It is no matter-a ver dat : do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself ? By gar , I vill kill de Jack priest ; and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon . By gar , I will myself have Anne Page .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Sir , the maid loves you , and all shall be well . We must give folks leave to prate : what , the good-jer !
DOCTOR CAIUS : Rugby , come to the court with me . By gar , if I have not Anne Page , I shall turn your head out of my door . Follow my heels , Rugby .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : You shall have An fool 's-head of your own . No , I know Anne 's mind for that : never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne 's mind than I do ; nor can do more than I do with her , I thank heaven .
FENTON : Who 's within there ? ho !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Who 's there , I trow ! Come near the house , I pray you . Enter FENTON
FENTON : How now , good woman ? how dost thou ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : The better that it pleases your good worship to ask .
FENTON : What news ? how does pretty Mistress Anne ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : In truth , sir , and she is pretty , and honest , and gentle ; and one that is your friend , I can tell you that by the way ; I praise heaven for it .
FENTON : Shall I do any good , thinkest thou ? shall I not lose my suit ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Troth , sir , all is in his hands above : but notwithstanding , Master Fenton , I 'll be sworn on a book , she loves you . Have not your worship a wart above your eye ?
FENTON : Yes , marry , have I ; what of that ?
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Well , thereby hangs a tale : good faith , it is such another Nan ; but , I detest , an honest maid as ever broke bread : we had an hour 's talk of that wart . I shall never laugh but in that maid 's company ! But indeed she is given too much to allicholy and musing : but for you--well , go to .
FENTON : Well , I shall see her to-day . Hold , there 's money for thee ; let me have thy voice in my behalf : if thou seest her before me , commend me .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Will I ? i 'faith , that we will ; and I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence ; and of other wooers .
FENTON : Well , farewell ; I am in great haste now .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Farewell to your worship . Exit FENTON Truly , an honest gentleman : but Anne loves him not ; for I know Anne 's mind as well as another does . Out upon 't ! what have I forgot ? Exit Enter MISTRESS PAGE , with a letter
","He threatens Quickly, who had promised him she would encourage Anne to look favorably on him. Fenton enters; he's also in love with Anne and wants to know if Quickly has related his affections to her.  Mistress Page enters with a letter from Falstaff."
"MISTRESS FORD : Mistress Page ! trust me , I was going to your house .
MISTRESS PAGE : And , trust me , I was coming to you . You look very ill .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , I 'll ne 'er believe that ; I have to show to the contrary .
MISTRESS PAGE : Faith , but you do , in my mind .
MISTRESS FORD : Well , I do then ; yet I say I could show you to the contrary . O Mistress Page , give me some counsel !
MISTRESS PAGE : What 's the matter , woman ?
MISTRESS FORD : O woman , if it were not for one trifling respect , I could come to such honour !
MISTRESS PAGE : Hang the trifle , woman ! take the honour . What is it ? dispense with trifles ; what is it ?
MISTRESS FORD : If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so , I could be knighted .
MISTRESS PAGE : What ? thou liest ! Sir Alice Ford ! These knights will hack ; and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry .
MISTRESS FORD : We burn daylight : here , read , read ; perceive how I might be knighted . I shall think the worse of fat men , as long as I have an eye to make difference of men 's liking : and yet he would not swear ; praised women 's modesty ; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness , that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words ; but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of ' Green Sleeves . ' What tempest , I trow , threw this whale , with so many tuns of oil in his belly , ashore at Windsor ? How shall I be revenged on him ? I think the best way were to entertain him with hope , till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease . Did you ever hear the like ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Letter for letter , but that the name of Page and Ford differs ! To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions , here 's the twin-brother of thy letter : but let thine inherit first ; for , I protest , mine never shall . I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters , writ with blank space for different names--sure , more , --and these are of the second edition : he will print them , out of doubt ; for he cares not what he puts into the press , when he would put us two . I had rather be a giantess , and lie under Mount Pelion . Well , I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man .
MISTRESS FORD : Why , this is the very same ; the very hand , the very words . What doth he think of us ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Nay , I know not : it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty . I 'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal ; for , sure , unless he know some strain in me , that I know not myself , he would never have boarded me in this fury .
MISTRESS FORD : ' Boarding , ' call you it ? I 'll be sure to keep him above deck .
MISTRESS PAGE : So will I if he come under my hatches , I 'll never to sea again . Let 's be revenged on him : let 's appoint him a meeting ; give him a show of comfort in his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay , till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , I will consent to act any villany against him , that may not sully the chariness of our honesty . O , that my husband saw this letter ! it would give eternal food to his jealousy .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why , look where he comes ; and my good man too : he 's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause ; and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance .
","She's astonished that he has the gall to try to seduce her and wonders how she will seek revenge. Mistress Ford appears with her own letter, which they discover is exactly the same.

FORD : You heard what this knave told me , did you not ?
PAGE : Yes : and you heard what the other told me ?
FORD : Do you think there is truth in them ?
PAGE : Hang ' em , slaves ! I do not think the knight would offer it : but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men ; very rogues , now they be out of service .
FORD : Were they his men ?

FORD : I like it never the better for that . Does he lie at the Garter ?

FALSTAFF : Mistress Ford ; come , Mistress Ford , --
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Marry , this is the short and the long of it ; you have brought her into such a canaries as ' tis wonderful . The best courtier of them all , when the court lay at Windsor , could never have brought her to such a canary . Yet there has been knights , and lords , and gentlemen , with their coaches , I warrant you , coach after coach , letter after letter , gift after gift ; smelling so sweetly , all musk , and so rushling , I warrant you , in silk and gold ; and in such alligant terms ; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest , that would have won any woman 's heart ; and , I warrant you , they could never get an eye-wink of her : I had myself twenty angels given me this morning ; but I defy all angels , in any such sort , as they say , but in the way of honesty : and , I warrant you , they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all : and yet there has been earls , nay , which is more , pensioners ; but , I warrant you , all is one with her .

MISTRESS QUICKLY : That were a jest indeed ! they have not so little grace , I hope : that were a trick indeed ! but Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page , of all loves : her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page ; and truly Master Page is an honest man . Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does : do what she will , say what she will , take all , pay all , go to bed when she list , rise when she list , all is as she will : and truly she deserves it ; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor , she is one . You must send her your page ; no remedy .
FALSTAFF : Why , I will .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Nay , but do so , then : and , look you , he may come and go between you both ; and in any case have a nay-word , that you may know one another 's mind , and the boy never need to understand any thing ; for ' tis not good that children should know any wickedness : old folks , you know , have discretion , as they say , and know the world .

FORD : Sir , I am a gentleman that have spent much ; my name is Brook .
FALSTAFF : Good Master Brook , I desire more acquaintance of you .
FORD : Good Sir John , I sue for yours : not to charge you ; for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are : the which hath something embolden 'd me to this unseasoned intrusion ; for they say , if money go before , all ways do lie open .
FALSTAFF : Money is a good soldier , sir , and will on .
FORD : Troth , and I have a bag of money here troubles me : if you will help to bear it , Sir John , take all , or half , for easing me of the carriage .

FORD : I will tell you , sir , if you will give me the hearing .
","Mistress Page has not yet gotten her husband to leave the house, so she'll make a date at a later time. Then Ford enters in disguise, announced under the name Brooke."
"FORD : Sir , I hear you are a scholar , --I will be brief with you , --and you have been a man long known to me , though I had never so good means , as desire , to make myself acquainted with you . I shall discover a thing to you , wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection : but , good Sir John , as you have one eye upon my follies , as you hear them unfolded , turn another into the register of your own ; that I may pass with a reproof the easier , sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender .
FALSTAFF : Very well , sir ; proceed .
FORD : There is a gentlewoman in this town ; her husband 's name is Ford .
FALSTAFF : Well , sir .
FORD : I have long loved her , and , I protest to you , bestowed much on her ; followed her with a doting observance ; engrossed opportunities to meet her ; fee 'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her ; not only bought many presents to give her , but have given largely to many to know what she would have given ; briefly , I have pursued her as love hath pursued me ; which hath been on the wing of all occasions . But whatsoever I have merited , either in my mind or , in my means , meed , I am sure , I have received none ; unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite rate , and that hath taught me to say this : ' Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues ; Pursuing that that flies , and flying what pursues . ' 
FALSTAFF : Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands ?
FORD : Never .
FALSTAFF : Have you importuned her to such a purpose ?
FORD : Never .
FALSTAFF : Of what quality was your love , then ?
FORD : Like a fair house built on another man 's ground ; so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it .
FALSTAFF : To what purpose have you unfolded this to me ?
FORD : When I have told you that , I have told you all . Some say , that though she appear honest to me , yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her . Now , Sir John , here is the heart of my purpose : you are a gentleman of excellent breeding , admirable discourse , of great admittance , authentic in your place and person , generally allowed for your many war-like , court-like , and learned preparations .
FALSTAFF : O , sir !
FORD : Believe it , for you know it . There is money ; spend it , spend it ; spend more ; spend all I have ; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it , as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford 's wife : use your art of wooing ; win her to consent to you : if any man may , you may as soon as any .
FALSTAFF : Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection , that I should win what you would enjoy ? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously .
FORD : O , understand my drift . She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour , that the folly of my soul dares not present itself : she is too bright to be looked against . Now , could I could come to her with any detection in my hand , my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves : I could drive her then from the ward of her purity , her reputation , her marriage-vow , and a thousand other her defences , which now are too too strongly embattled against me . What say you to 't , Sir John ?
FALSTAFF : Master Brook , I will first make bold with your money ; next , give me your hand ; and last , as I am a gentleman , you shall , if you will , enjoy Ford 's wife .
FORD : O good sir !
","Ford tells Falstaff that he's in love with Mistress Ford, but that she has always rebuffed his advances, claiming that she's too honorable to cheat on her husband. He asks Falstaff to seduce Mistress Ford, thus destroying her honor, so she won't be able to turn him down in the future."
"FORD : Want no money , Sir John ; you shall want none .
FALSTAFF : Want no Mistress Ford , Master Brook ; you shall want none . I shall be with her , I may tell you , by her own appointment ; even as you came in to me , her assistant or go-between parted from me : I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven ; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth . Come you to me at night ; you shall know how I speed .
FORD : I am blest in your acquaintance . Do you know Ford , sir ?
FALSTAFF : Hang him , poor cuckoldly knave ! I know him not : yet I wrong him to call him poor ; they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money ; for the which his wife seems to me well-favored . I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue 's coffer ; and there 's my harvest-home .
FORD : I would you knew Ford , sir , that you might avoid him if you saw him .
FALSTAFF : Hang him , mechanical salt-butter rogue ! I will stare him out of his wits ; I will awe him with my cudgel : it shall hang like a meteor o 'er the cuckold 's horns . Master Brook , thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant , and thou shalt lie with his wife . Come to me soon at night . Ford 's a knave , and I will aggravate his style ; thou , Master Brook , shalt know him for knave and cuckold . Come to me soon at night . Exit
FORD : What a damned Epicurean rascal is this ! My heart is ready to crack with impatience . Who says this is improvident jealousy ? my wife hath sent to him ; the hour is fixed ; the match is made . Would any man have thought this ? See the hell of having a false woman ! My bed shall be abused , my coffers ransacked , my reputation gnawn at ; and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong , but stand under the adoption of abominable terms , and by him that does me this wrong . Terms ! names ! Amaimon sounds well ; Lucifer , well ; Barbason , well ; yet they are devils ' additions , the names of fiends : but Cuckold ! Wittol ! --Cuckold ! the devil himself hath not such a name . Page is an ass , a secure ass : he will trust his wife ; he will not be jealous . I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter , Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese , an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle , or a thief to walk my ambling gelding , than my wife with herself ; then she plots , then she ruminates , then she devises ; and what they think in their hearts they may effect , they will break their hearts but they will effect . God be praised for my jealousy ! Eleven o 'clock the hour . I will prevent this , detect my wife , be revenged on Falstaff , and laugh at Page . I will about it ; better three hours too soon than a minute too late . Fie , fie , fie ! cuckold ! cuckold ! cuckold ! Exit Enter DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY

FORD : Well met , Mistress Page . Whither go you ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Truly , sir , to see your wife . Is she at home ?
FORD : Ay ; and as idle as she may hang together , for want of company . I think , if your husbands were dead , you two would marry .
MISTRESS PAGE : Be sure of that , --two other husbands .
FORD : Where had you this pretty weather-cock ?
MISTRESS PAGE : I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of . What do you call your knight 's name , sirrah ?
ROBIN : Sir John Falstaff .
FORD : Sir John Falstaff !
MISTRESS PAGE : He , he ; I can never hit on 's name . There is such a league between my good man and he ! Is your wife at home indeed ?
FORD : Indeed she is .
MISTRESS PAGE : By your leave , sir : I am sick till I see her .
","Caius and Evans speak quietly to each other of their suspicion that the Host has plotted to make them look like fools because he scorns Evans for his Welsh accent and Caius for his French one.

"SHALLOW PAGE & C : Well met , Master Ford .

SLENDER : And so must I , sir : we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne , and I would not break with her for more money than I 'll speak of .
SHALLOW : We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender , and this day we shall have our answer .
SLENDER : I hope I have your good will , father Page .

DOCTOR CAIUS : Ay , be-gar ; and de maid is love-a me : my nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush .

PAGE : Not by my consent , I promise you . The gentleman is of no having : he kept company with the wild prince and Poins ; he is of too high a region ; he knows too much . No , he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance : if he take her , let him take her simply ; the wealth I have waits on my consent , and my consent goes not that way .
FORD : I beseech you heartily , some of you go home with me to dinner : besides your cheer , you shall have sport ; I will show you a monster . Master doctor , you shall go ; so shall you , Master Page ; and you , Sir Hugh .

MISTRESS FORD : I your lady , Sir John ! alas , I should be a pitiful lady !
FALSTAFF : Let the court of France show me such another . I see how thine eye would emulate the diamond : thou hast the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the ship-tire , the tire-valiant , or any tire of Venetian admittance .
MISTRESS FORD : A plain kerchief , Sir John : my brows become nothing else ; nor that well neither .
FALSTAFF : By the Lord , thou art a traitor to say so : thou wouldst make an absolute courtier ; and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale .

"FORD : And sped you , sir ?
FALSTAFF : Very ill-favoredly , Master Brook .

FALSTAFF : No , Master Brook ; but the peaking Cornuto her husband , Master Brook , dwelling in a continual ' larum of jealousy , comes me in the instant of our encounter , after we had embraced , kissed , protested , and , as it were , spoke the prologue of our comedy ; and at his heels a rabble of his companions , thither provoked and instigated by his distemper , and , forsooth , to search his house for his wife 's love .
FORD : What , while you were there ?
FALSTAFF : While I was there .
FORD : And did he search for you , and could not find you ?
FALSTAFF : You shall hear . As good luck would have it , comes in one Mistress Page ; gives intelligence of Ford 's approach ; and , in her invention and Ford 's wife 's distraction , they conveyed me into a buck-basket .
FORD : A buck-basket !
FALSTAFF : By the Lord , a buck-basket ! rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks , socks , foul stockings , greasy napkins ; that , Master Brook , there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril .
FORD : And how long lay you there ?
FALSTAFF : Nay , you shall hear , Master Brook , what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good . Being thus crammed in the basket , a couple of Ford 's knaves , his hinds , were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane : they took me on their shoulders ; met the jealous knave their master in the door , who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket : I quaked for fear , lest the lunatic knave would have searched it ; but fate , ordaining he should be a cuckold , held his hand . Well : on went he for a search , and away went I for foul clothes . But mark the sequel , Master Brook : I suffered the pangs of three several deaths ; first , an intolerable fright , to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether ; next , to be compassed , like a good bilbo , in the circumference of a peck , hilt to point , heel to head ; and then , to be stopped in , like a strong distillation , with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease : think of that , --a man of my kidney , --think of that , --that am as subject to heat as butter ; a man of continual dissolution and thaw : it was a miracle to scape suffocation . And in the height of this bath , when I was more than half stewed in grease , like a Dutch dish , to be thrown into the Thames , and cooled , glowing hot , in that surge , like a horse-shoe ; think of that , --hissing hot , --think of that , Master Brook .
FORD : In good sadness , I am sorry that for my sake you have sufferd all this . My suit then is desperate ; you 'll undertake her no more ?
FALSTAFF : Master Brook , I will be thrown into Etna , as I have been into Thames , ere I will leave her thus . Her husband is this morning gone a-birding : I have received from her another embassy of meeting ; ' twixt eight and nine is the hour , Master Brook .
FORD : ' Tis past eight already , sir .
FALSTAFF : Is it ? I will then address me to my appointment . Come to me at your convenient leisure , and you shall know how I speed ; and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her . Adieu . You shall have her , Master Brook ; Master Brook , you shall cuckold Ford . Exit

FALSTAFF : Mistress Ford , your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance . I see you are obsequious in your love , and I profess requital to a hair 's breadth ; not only , Mistress Ford , in the simple office of love , but in all the accoutrement , complement and ceremony of it . But are you sure of your husband now ?
MISTRESS FORD : He 's a-birding , sweet Sir John .
MISTRESS PAGE : What , ho , gossip Ford ! what , ho !
MISTRESS FORD : Step into the chamber , Sir John . Exit FALSTAFF Enter MISTRESS PAGE
MISTRESS PAGE : How now , sweetheart ! who 's at home besides yourself ?
MISTRESS FORD : Why , none but mine own people .
MISTRESS PAGE : Indeed !
MISTRESS FORD : No , certainly . Aside to her Speak louder .
MISTRESS PAGE : Truly , I am so glad you have nobody here .
MISTRESS FORD : Why ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Why , woman , your husband is in his old lunes again : he so takes on yonder with my husband ; so rails against all married mankind ; so curses all Eve 's daughters , of what complexion soever ; and so buffets himself on the forehead , crying , ' Peer out , peer out ! ' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness , civility and patience , to this his distemper he is in now : I am glad the fat knight is not here .
MISTRESS FORD : Why , does he talk of him ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Of none but him ; and swears he was carried out , the last time he searched for him , in a basket ; protests to my husband he is now here , and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport , to make another experiment of his suspicion : but I am glad the knight is not here ; now he shall see his own foolery .
MISTRESS FORD : How near is he , Mistress Page ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Hard by ; at street end ; he will be here anon .
MISTRESS FORD : I am undone ! The knight is here .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why then you are utterly shamed , and he 's but a dead man . What a woman are you ! --Away with him , away with him ! better shame than murder .
FORD : Which way should be go ? how should I bestow him ? Shall I put him into the basket again ? Re-enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF : No , I 'll come no more i ' the basket . May I not go out ere he come ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Alas , three of Master Ford 's brothers watch the door with pistols , that none shall issue out ; otherwise you might slip away ere he came . But what make you here ?
FALSTAFF : What shall I do ? I 'll creep up into the chimney .
MISTRESS FORD : There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces . Creep into the kiln-hole .
FALSTAFF : Where is it ?
MISTRESS FORD : He will seek there , on my word . Neither press , coffer , chest , trunk , well , vault , but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places , and goes to them by his note : there is no hiding you in the house .
FALSTAFF : I 'll go out then .
MISTRESS PAGE : If you go out in your own semblance , you die , Sir John . Unless you go out disguised--
MISTRESS FORD : How might we disguise him ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Alas the day , I know not ! There is no woman 's gown big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat , a muffler and a kerchief , and so escape .
FALSTAFF : Good hearts , devise something : any extremity rather than a mischief .
MISTRESS FORD : My maid 's aunt , the fat woman of Brentford , has a gown above .
","Falstaff returns to Mistress Ford's house, and again Mistress Page enters soon after. Falstaff hides, and Mistress Page warns Mistress Ford of her husband's approach. How will they hide Falstaff this time? He emerges and refuses to go in the laundry again. Mistress Ford suggests that he wear the clothes of her servant's fat aunt to escape in disguise."
"MISTRESS FORD : Go , go , sweet Sir John : Mistress Page and I will look some linen for your head .
MISTRESS PAGE : Quick , quick ! we 'll come dress you straight : put on the gown the while . Exit FALSTAFF
MISTRESS FORD : I would my husband would meet him in this shape : he cannot abide the old woman of Brentford ; he swears she 's a witch ; forbade her my house and hath threatened to beat her .
MISTRESS PAGE : Heaven guide him to thy husband 's cudgel , and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards !
MISTRESS FORD : But is my husband coming ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Ah , in good sadness , is he ; and talks of the basket too , howsoever he hath had intelligence .
MISTRESS FORD : We 'll try that ; for I 'll appoint my men to carry the basket again , to meet him at the door with it , as they did last time .
MISTRESS PAGE : Nay , but he 'll be here presently : let 's go dress him like the witch of Brentford .
MISTRESS FORD : I 'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket . Go up ; I 'll bring linen for him straight . Exit
MISTRESS PAGE : Hang him , dishonest varlet ! we cannot misuse him enough .

First Servant : Come , come , take it up .
Second Servant : Pray heaven it be not full of knight again .
First Servant : I hope not ; I had as lief bear so much lead . Enter FORD , PAGE , SHALLOW , DOCTOR CAIUS , and SIR HUGH EVANS
FORD : Ay , but if it prove true , Master Page , have you any way then to unfool me again ? Set down the basket , villain ! Somebody call my wife . Youth in a basket ! O you panderly rascals ! there 's a knot , a ging , a pack , a conspiracy against me : now shall the devil be shamed . What , wife , I say ! Come , come forth ! Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching !
PAGE : Why , this passes , Master Ford ; you are not to go loose any longer ; you must be pinioned .

FORD : Well said , brazen-face ! hold it out . Come forth , sirrah ! Pulling clothes out of the basket
PAGE : This passes !
MISTRESS FORD : Are you not ashamed ? let the clothes alone .
FORD : I shall find you anon .
SIR HUGH EVANS : ' Tis unreasonable ! Will you take up your wife 's clothes ? Come away .
FORD : Empty the basket , I say !
MISTRESS FORD : Why , man , why ?
FORD : Master Page , as I am a man , there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket : why may not he be there again ? In my house I am sure he is : my intelligence is true ; my jealousy is reasonable . Pluck me out all the linen .
MISTRESS FORD : If you find a man there , he shall die a flea 's death .
",Mistress Ford tells Mistress Page about her husband’s dislike of the fat aunt. Ford arrives and stops the servant from taking the laundry. He asks them to empty the basket.
"SHALLOW : By my fidelity , this is not well , Master Ford ; this wrongs you .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Master Ford , you must pray , and not follow the imaginations of your own heart : this is jealousies .
FORD : Well , he 's not here I seek for .
PAGE : No , nor nowhere else but in your brain .
FORD : Help to search my house this one time . If I find not what I seek , show no colour for my extremity ; let me for ever be your table-sport ; let them say of me , ' As jealous as Ford , Chat searched a hollow walnut for his wife 's leman . ' Satisfy me once more ; once more search with me .
MISTRESS FORD : What , ho , Mistress Page ! come you and the old woman down ; my husband will come into the chamber .
FORD : Old woman ! what old woman 's that ?
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , it is my maid 's aunt of Brentford .
FORD : A witch , a quean , an old cozening quean ! Have I not forbid her my house ? She comes of errands , does she ? We are simple men ; we do not know what 's brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling . She works by charms , by spells , by the figure , and such daubery as this is , beyond our element we know nothing . Come down , you witch , you hag , you ; come down , I say !
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , good , sweet husband ! Good gentlemen , let him not strike the old woman . Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman 's clothes , and MISTRESS PAGE

MISTRESS PAGE : Are you not ashamed ? I think you have killed the poor woman .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , he will do it . ' Tis a goodly credit for you .
FORD : Hang her , witch !
SIR HUGH EVANS : By the yea and no , I think the ' oman is a witch indeed : I like not when a ' oman has a great peard ; I spy a great peard under his muffler .
FORD : Will you follow , gentlemen ? I beseech you , follow ; see but the issue of my jealousy : if I cry out thus upon no trail , never trust me when I open again .
PAGE : Let 's obey his humour a little further : come , gentlemen .
MISTRESS PAGE : Trust me , he beat him most pitifully .
MISTRESS FORD : Nay , by the mass , that he did not ; he beat him most unpitifully , methought .
MISTRESS PAGE : I 'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o 'er the altar ; it hath done meritorious service .
MISTRESS FORD : What think you ? may we , with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience , pursue him with any further revenge ?
MISTRESS PAGE : The spirit of wantonness is , sure , scared out of him : if the devil have him not in fee-simple , with fine and recovery , he will never , I think , in the way of waste , attempt us again .
MISTRESS FORD : Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Yes , by all means ; if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband 's brains . If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted , we two will still be the ministers .
MISTRESS FORD : I 'll warrant they 'll have him publicly shamed : and methinks there would be no period to the jest , should he not be publicly shamed .
MISTRESS PAGE : Come , to the forge with it then ; shape it : I would not have things cool . Enter Host and BARDOLPH
","Shallow warns him against emptying the basket.  When Ford finds nothing in the laundry basket he loses his temper and angrily beats the 'aunt' out of the house. Mistress Ford and Mistress Page are pleased; they think they have proven their point, and so they decide to tell their husbands of their schemes."
"Host : What duke should that be comes so secretly ? I hear not of him in the court . Let me speak with the gentlemen : they speak English ?
BARDOLPH : Ay , sir ; I 'll call them to you .

SIR HUGH EVANS : ' Tis one of the best discretions of a ' oman as ever I did look upon .
PAGE : And did he send you both these letters at an instant ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Within a quarter of an hour .
FORD : Pardon me , wife . Henceforth do what thou wilt ; I rather will suspect the sun with cold Than thee with wantonness : now doth thy honour stand In him that was of late an heretic , As firm as faith .
PAGE : ' Tis well , ' tis well ; no more : Be not as extreme in submission As in offence . But let our plot go forward : let our wives Yet once again , to make us public sport , Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow , Where we may take him and disgrace him for it .
FORD : There is no better way than that they spoke of .
PAGE : How ? to send him word they 'll meet him in the park at midnight ? Fie , fie ! he 'll never come .
SIR HUGH EVANS : You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has been grievously peaten as an old ' oman : methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come ; methinks his flesh is punished , he shall have no desires .
PAGE : So think I too .
MISTRESS FORD : Devise but how you 'll use him when he comes , And let us two devise to bring him thither .
MISTRESS PAGE : There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter , Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest , Doth all the winter-time , at still midnight , Walk round about an oak , with great ragg 'd horns ; And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain In a most hideous and dreadful manner : You have heard of such a spirit , and well you know The superstitious idle-headed eld Received and did deliver to our age This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth .
PAGE : Why , yet there want not many that do fear In deep of night to walk by this Herne 's oak : But what of this ?
MISTRESS FORD : Marry , this is our device ; That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us .
PAGE : Well , let it not be doubted but he 'll come : And in this shape when you have brought him thither , What shall be done with him ? what is your plot ?
MISTRESS PAGE : That likewise have we thought upon , and thus : Nan Page my daughter and my little son And three or four more of their growth we 'll dress Like urchins , ouphes and fairies , green and white , With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads , And rattles in their hands : upon a sudden , As Falstaff , she and I , are newly met , Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once With some diffused song : upon their sight , We two in great amazedness will fly : Then let them all encircle him about And , fairy-like , to-pinch the unclean knight , And ask him why , that hour of fairy revel , In their so sacred paths he dares to tread In shape profane .
MISTRESS FORD : And till he tell the truth , Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound And burn him with their tapers .
MISTRESS PAGE : The truth being known , We 'll all present ourselves , dis-horn the spirit , And mock him home to Windsor .
","Ford apologizes to his wife for his jealousy, and he promises never to suspect her again. They decide that it would be fun to work together to humiliate Falstaff publicly. They plan to have Mistress Ford invite Falstaff to meet her in an allegedly haunted wood, and they'll dress their children up as ghosts and monsters to terrify and embarrass Falstaff."
"SIR HUGH EVANS : I will teach the children their behaviors ; and I will be like a jack-an-apes also , to burn the knight with my taber .
FORD : That will be excellent . I 'll go and buy them vizards .
MISTRESS PAGE : My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies , Finely attired in a robe of white .
PAGE : That silk will I go buy . Aside And in that time Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away And marry her at Eton . Go send to Falstaff straight .
FORD : Nay I 'll to him again in name of Brook He 'll tell me all his purpose : sure , he 'll come .
MISTRESS PAGE : Fear not you that . Go get us properties And tricking for our fairies .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Let us about it : it is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries .
MISTRESS PAGE : Go , Mistress Ford , Send quickly to Sir John , to know his mind . Exit MISTRESS FORD I 'll to the doctor : he hath my good will , And none but he , to marry with Nan Page .

SIMPLE : My master , sir , Master Slender , sent to her , seeing her go through the streets , to know , sir , whether one Nym , sir , that beguiled him of a chain , had the chain or no .
FALSTAFF : I spake with the old woman about it .
SIMPLE : And what says she , I pray , sir ?
FALSTAFF : Marry , she says that the very same man that beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of it .
SIMPLE : I would I could have spoken with the woman herself ; I had other things to have spoken with her too from him .
FALSTAFF : What are they ? let us know .
Host : Ay , come ; quick .
SIMPLE : I may not conceal them , sir .

Host : Hue and cry , villain , go ! Assist me , knight . I am undone ! Fly , run , hue and cry , villain ! I am undone !
FALSTAFF : I would all the world might be cozened ; for I have been cozened and beaten too . If it should come to the ear of the court , how I have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled , they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermen 's boots with me ; I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were as crest-fallen as a dried pear .

MISTRESS QUICKLY : And have not they suffered ? Yes , I warrant ; speciously one of them ; Mistress Ford , good heart , is beaten black and blue , that you cannot see a white spot about her .
FALSTAFF : What tellest thou me of black and blue ? I was beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow ; and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brentford : but that my admirable dexterity of wit , my counterfeiting the action of an old woman , delivered me , the knave constable had set me i ' the stocks , i ' the common stocks , for a witch .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : Sir , let me speak with you in your chamber : you shall hear how things go ; and , I warrant , to your content . Here is a letter will say somewhat . Good hearts , what ado here is to bring you together ! Sure , one of you does not serve heaven well , that you are so crossed .
",Caius and Evans avenge themselves on the Host by stealing three of his horses in a scheme that had him believing he had lent the horses to three German lords on their way to the royal court. Mistress Quickly tells Falstaff about the beating Mistress Ford has received.
"Host : Master Fenton , talk not to me ; my mind is heavy : I will give over all .
FENTON : Yet hear me speak . Assist me in my purpose , And , as I am a gentleman , I 'll give thee A hundred pound in gold more than your loss .
Host : I will hear you , Master Fenton ; and I will at the least keep your counsel .
FENTON : From time to time I have acquainted you With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page ; Who mutually hath answer 'd my affection , So far forth as herself might be her chooser , Even to my wish : I have a letter from her Of such contents as you will wonder at ; The mirth whereof so larded with my matter , That neither singly can be manifested , Without the show of both ; fat Falstaff Hath a great scene : the image of the jest I 'll show you here at large . Hark , good mine host . To-night at Herne 's oak , just ' twixt twelve and one , Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen ; The purpose why , is here : in which disguise , While other jests are something rank on foot , Her father hath commanded her to slip Away with Slender and with him at Eton Immediately to marry : she hath consented : Now , sir , Her mother , ever strong against that match And firm for Doctor Caius , hath appointed That he shall likewise shuffle her away , While other sports are tasking of their minds , And at the deanery , where a priest attends , Straight marry her : to this her mother 's plot She seemingly obedient likewise hath Made promise to the doctor . Now , thus it rests : Her father means she shall be all in white , And in that habit , when Slender sees his time To take her by the hand and bid her go , She shall go with him : her mother hath intended , The better to denote her to the doctor , For they must all be mask 'd and vizarded , That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed , With ribands pendent , flaring ' bout her head ; And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe , To pinch her by the hand , and , on that token , The maid hath given consent to go with him .
Host : Which means she to deceive , father or mother ?
FENTON : Both , my good host , to go along with me : And here it rests , that you 'll procure the vicar To stay for me at church ' twixt twelve and one , And , in the lawful name of marrying , To give our hearts united ceremony .
Host : Well , husband your device ; I 'll to the vicar : Bring you the maid , you shall not lack a priest .
FENTON : So shall I evermore be bound to thee ; Besides , I 'll make a present recompense . Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY
FALSTAFF : Prithee , no more prattling ; go . I 'll hold . This is the third time ; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers . Away I go . They say there is divinity in odd numbers , either in nativity , chance , or death . Away !
MISTRESS QUICKLY : I 'll provide you a chain ; and I 'll do what I can to get you a pair of horns .
FALSTAFF : Away , I say ; time wears : hold up your head , and mince . Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY Enter FORD How now , Master Brook ! Master Brook , the matter will be known to-night , or never . Be you in the Park about midnight , at Herne 's oak , and you shall see wonders .
FORD : Went you not to her yesterday , sir , as you told me you had appointed ?
",Fenton speaks to the Host of a letter he has received from Anne. She says that her parents want to use the chaos of disguised children in the haunted wood as an opportunity for her suitors to elope with her. Her mother wants her to run off with Caius and her father prefers Slender. Each instructs her to wear a specific outfit so each suitor may find her. But she intends to deceive them both. Fenton asks the Host to help him find a vicar who will marry them that night.
"PAGE : Come , come ; we 'll couch i ' the castle-ditch till we see the light of our fairies . Remember , son Slender , my daughter .
SLENDER : Ay , forsooth ; I have spoke with her and we have a nay-word how to know one another : I come to her in white , and cry ' mum ; ' she cries ' budget ; ' and by that we know one another .
SHALLOW : That 's good too : but what needs either your ' mum ' or her ' budget ? ' the white will decipher her well enough . It hath struck ten o 'clock .

DOCTOR CAIUS : I know vat I have to do . Adieu .
MISTRESS PAGE : Fare you well , sir . Exit DOCTOR CAIUS My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor 's marrying my daughter : but ' tis no matter ; better a little chiding than a great deal of heart-break .
MISTRESS FORD : Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies , and the Welsh devil Hugh ?
MISTRESS PAGE : They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne 's oak , with obscured lights ; which , at the very instant of Falstaff 's and our meeting , they will at once display to the night .
MISTRESS FORD : That cannot choose but amaze him .
MISTRESS PAGE : If he be not amazed , he will be mocked ; if he be amazed , he will every way be mocked .

FALSTAFF : The Windsor bell hath struck twelve ; the minute draws on . Now , the hot-blooded gods assist me ! Remember , Jove , thou wast a bull for thy Europa ; love set on thy horns . O powerful love ! that , in some respects , makes a beast a man , in some other , a man a beast . You were also , Jupiter , a swan for the love of Leda . O omnipotent Love ! how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose ! A fault done first in the form of a beast . O Jove , a beastly fault ! And then another fault in the semblance of a fowl ; think on ' t , Jove ; a foul fault ! When gods have hot backs , what shall poor men do ? For me , I am here a Windsor stag ; and the fattest , I think , i ' the forest . Send me a cool rut-time , Jove , or who can blame me to piss my tallow ? Who comes here ? my doe ?

MISTRESS FORD : Mistress Page is come with me , sweetheart .
","Later, in the park, Mr. Page advises Slender to elope with Anne, whom he thinks will be disguised as a fairy dressed in white. Mistress Page informs Caius that Anne will be dressed in green. Falstaff arrives, fully dressed as Herne the Hunter. The disguised children hide and wait. Ford and Page and their friends arrive to watch, and Mistress Ford and Mistress Page approach Falstaff. He's delighted to see they have both come to meet him."

Go you , and where you find a maid That , ere she sleep , has thrice her prayers said , Raise up the organs of her fantasy ; Sleep she as sound as careless infancy : But those as sleep and think not on their sins , Pinch them , arms , legs , backs , shoulders , sides and shins .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : About , about ; Search Windsor Castle , elves , within and out : Strew good luck , ouphes , on every sacred room : That it may stand till the perpetual doom , In state as wholesome as in state ' tis fit , Worthy the owner , and the owner it . The several chairs of order look you scour With juice of balm and every precious flower : Each fair instalment , coat , and several crest , With loyal blazon , evermore be blest ! And nightly , meadow-fairies , look you sing , Like to the Garter 's compass , in a ring : The expressure that it bears , green let it be , More fertile-fresh than all the field to see ; And ' Honi soit qui mal y pense ' write In emerald tufts , flowers purple , blue and white ; Let sapphire , pearl and rich embroidery , Buckled below fair knighthood 's bending knee : Fairies use flowers for their charactery . Away ; disperse : but till ' tis one o 'clock , Our dance of custom round about the oak Of Herne the hunter , let us not forget .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Pray you , lock hand in hand ; yourselves in order set And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be , To guide our measure round about the tree . But , stay ; I smell a man of middle-earth .
FALSTAFF : Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy , lest he transform me to a piece of cheese !
PISTOL : Vile worm , thou wast o 'erlook 'd even in thy birth .
MISTRESS QUICKLY : With trial-fire touch me his finger-end : If he be chaste , the flame will back descend And turn him to no pain ; but if he start , It is the flesh of a corrupted heart .
PISTOL : A trial , come .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Come , will this wood take fire ? They burn him with their tapers
FALSTAFF : Oh , Oh , Oh !
","Then they hear a noise and the women run away. Falstaff is surrounded by disguised elves and ghouls and is terrified. Mistress Quickly, playing the fairy queen, says they should try to burn the human they have encountered, and if he doesn't burn then he is pure. They burn Falstaff with candles and encircle him and pinch him.  Finally, the disguised children depart, and Page and Ford enter."
"PAGE : Nay , do not fly ; I think we have watch 'd you now Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn ?
MISTRESS PAGE : I pray you , come , hold up the jest no higher Now , good Sir John , how like you Windsor wives ? See you these , husband ? do not these fair yokes Become the forest better than the town ?
FORD : Now , sir , who 's a cuckold now ? Master Brook , Falstaff 's a knave , a cuckoldly knave ; here are his horns , Master Brook : and , Master Brook , he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford 's but his buck-basket , his cudgel , and twenty pounds of money , which must be paid to Master Brook ; his horses are arrested for it , Master Brook .
MISTRESS FORD : Sir John , we have had ill luck ; we could never meet . I will never take you for my love again ; but I will always count you my deer .
FALSTAFF : I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass .
FORD : Ay , and an ox too : both the proofs are extant .
FALSTAFF : And these are not fairies ? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies : and yet the guiltiness of my mind , the sudden surprise of my powers , drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief , in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason , that they were fairies . See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent , when ' tis upon ill employment !
SIR HUGH EVANS : Sir John Falstaff , serve Got , and leave your desires , and fairies will not pinse you .
FORD : Well said , fairy Hugh .
SIR HUGH EVANS : And leave your jealousies too , I pray you .
FORD : I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good English .
FALSTAFF : Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it , that it wants matter to prevent so gross o 'erreaching as this ? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too ? shall I have a coxcomb of frize ? ' Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese .
SIR HUGH EVANS : Seese is not good to give putter ; your belly is all putter .
FALSTAFF : ' Seese ' and ' putter ' ! have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English ? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why Sir John , do you think , though we would have the virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell , that ever the devil could have made you our delight ?
FORD : What , a hodge-pudding ? a bag of flax ?
MISTRESS PAGE : A puffed man ?
PAGE : Old , cold , withered and of intolerable entrails ?
FORD : And one that is as slanderous as Satan ?
PAGE : And as poor as Job ?
FORD : And as wicked as his wife ?
SIR HUGH EVANS : And given to fornications , and to taverns and sack and wine and metheglins , and to drinkings and swearings and starings , pribbles and prabbles ?
FALSTAFF : Well , I am your theme : you have the start of me ; I am dejected ; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel ; ignorance itself is a plummet o 'er me : use me as you will .
FORD : Marry , sir , we 'll bring you to Windsor , to one Master Brook , that you have cozened of money , to whom you should have been a pander : over and above that you have suffered , I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction .
PAGE : Yet be cheerful , knight : thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house ; where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife , that now laughs at thee : tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter .
","Falstaff sees that he has been fooled and humiliated. Evans tells Falstaff that he should give up on his lusts and tells Ford that he should trust his wife. Meanwhile, they all wonder where Anne is."
"SLENDER : Whoa ho ! ho , father Page !
PAGE : Son , how now ! how now , son ! have you dispatched ?
SLENDER : Dispatched ! I 'll make the best in Gloucestershire know on 't ; would I were hanged , la , else .
PAGE : Of what , son ?
SLENDER : I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page , and she 's a great lubberly boy . If it had not been i ' the church , I would have swinged him , or he should have swinged me . If I did not think it had been Anne Page , would I might never stir ! --and ' tis a postmaster 's boy .
PAGE : Upon my life , then , you took the wrong .
SLENDER : What need you tell me that ? I think so , when I took a boy for a girl . If I had been married to him , for all he was in woman 's apparel , I would not have had him .
PAGE : Why , this is your own folly . Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments ?
SLENDER : I went to her in white , and cried ' mum , ' and she cried ' budget , ' as Anne and I had appointed ; and yet it was not Anne , but a postmaster 's boy .
MISTRESS PAGE : Good George , be not angry : I knew of your purpose ; turned my daughter into green ; and , indeed , she is now with the doctor at the deanery , and there married . Enter DOCTOR CAIUS
DOCTOR CAIUS : Vere is Mistress Page ? By gar , I am cozened : I ha ' married un garcon , a boy ; un paysan , by gar , a boy ; it is not Anne Page : by gar , I am cozened .
MISTRESS PAGE : Why , did you take her in green ?
DOCTOR CAIUS : Ay , by gar , and ' tis a boy : by gar , I 'll raise all Windsor . Exit
FORD : This is strange . Who hath got the right Anne ?
PAGE : My heart misgives me : here comes Master Fenton . Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE How now , Master Fenton !
ANNE PAGE : Pardon , good father ! good my mother , pardon !
PAGE : Now , mistress , how chance you went not with Master Slender ?
MISTRESS PAGE : Why went you not with master doctor , maid ?
FENTON : You do amaze her : hear the truth of it . You would have married her most shamefully , Where there was no proportion held in love . The truth is , she and I , long since contracted , Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us . The offence is holy that she hath committed ; And this deceit loses the name of craft , Of disobedience , or unduteous title , Since therein she doth evitate and shun A thousand irreligious cursed hours , Which forced marriage would have brought upon her .
FORD : Stand not amazed ; here is no remedy : In love the heavens themselves do guide the state ; Money buys lands , and wives are sold by fate .
FALSTAFF : I am glad , though you have ta 'en a special stand to strike at me , that your arrow hath glanced .
PAGE : Well , what remedy ? Fenton , heaven give thee joy ! What cannot be eschew 'd must be embraced .
FALSTAFF : When night-dogs run , all sorts of deer are chased .
MISTRESS PAGE : Well , I will muse no further . Master Fenton , Heaven give you many , many merry days ! Good husband , let us every one go home , And laugh this sport o 'er by a country fire ; Sir John and all .
","Slender arrives upset; in the confusion, he eloped with a young boy in Anne's outfit. Then Caius enters, in a rage that he has married a boy wearing Anne's assigned color outfit. Then Anne herself enters with Fenton. Fenton scolds the Pages for having thought to send Anne into a marriage without love. He and Anne have long been in love, he says, and now it has been finalized.  Ford says that love has won out, and Page and his wife realize their mistake in not having listened to the wishes of their daughter. Falstaff is pleased that their plan to humiliate him backfired partially in the marriage of Anne and Fenton. They adjourn to celebrate the marriage and invite Falstaff to join them."

Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to
Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
Chris: had no idea about the second one
Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse
Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again
Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
Emily: true
Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;)

Chris: makes sense
Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings
Oliver: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income
Chris: right
Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again
Emily: we can always do it during the next meeting
Oliver: as usual I'm up for anything

"Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea?
Ron: I might be lacking the context here
Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example
Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year.
Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.
Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility
Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?
Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.
Jessie: so what do we get from it really?
Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.
Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>
Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association
Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually
Michaela: I recall two as well
Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.
Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours
Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding
Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association
Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work
Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly
Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it
Michaela: Steve?
Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now
Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all?
Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer
Jessie: Fine by me
Ron: as well","Michaela proposed turning the club into an official association, which involves additional responsibilities, but also gives new possibilities.

Leu: Nor can I.

Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.
Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...

"Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? 
Max: <link_video>
Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn’t watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)
Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well.
Daniel: Short attention span 😊
Max: Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️
Max: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other. 
David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco.
Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.
